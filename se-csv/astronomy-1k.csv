"Star like light moving in the sky, what could it be?","87068","","<p>I was camping this weekend away from the city, so my friends and I decided to spend one of the nights watching the sky, since it's impossible to see anything around where we live. After a little while, of staring up, I saw what looked like a star moving. It moved fast, but not a long distance, and various directions and back. It was about the same size of the other stars near by. It was not as bright as other stars though. I stopped looking up for a little bit, to make sure my eyes were seeing things correctly. But then I looked up again I continued to see the light moving. I thought I was going crazy, so I pointed it out to my friend. It took him a little while, but after a few minutes he also saw it. His girlfriend also saw it a few minutes later. My friend brought up something about satellite reflections and other theories, but we have no idea what we saw.</p>

<p>So what could it be?</p>
","<p>There was a object, apparently flying above you, that you couldn't identify. By definition this is an unidentified flying object. However this does not imply that it was an extra-terrestrial spacecraft.</p>

<p>UFO reports can be explained by a combination of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not recognising a known natural object, such as Venus, or unusual clouds.</li>
<li>Planes, drones, Chinese lanterns or satellites.</li>
<li>Optical illusion, dreams or the effects of drugs.</li>
<li>Deliberate falsification.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no real way to decide what it was you saw. There are a couple of points in your report that are odd. You describe it as the same size as stars, but less bright. Stars have no visible size,  and have many magnitudes of brightness. Your report suggests that you are someone who doesn't regularly observe the sky, and so is likely to be more susceptible to optical illusions and tricks that eyes can play on us.</p>

"How much magnification is needed to see planets of solar system?","66377","","<p>I have a 3inch Newtonian reflector telescope with 300 mm focal length. I can use highest magnification of 75x using a 4mm eyepiece. But in 75x I can't see the details of Jupiter what was expected. Instead I see a little blurry image. Now I would like to know how much magnification is necessary to see a good details of Jupiter and other planets. And one more question: Is there any way to improve the vision of my 3 inch telescope?</p>
","<p>You're probably asking the wrong question - which I am going to answer anyway, and after that I am going to answer the question you should have asked instead.</p>

<hr>

<p>As a general rule, there isn't much point in pushing the magnification above 2x the diameter of the instrument, measured in mm. 3 inch, that's 75mm, that's 150x max. Beyond that limit, even under ideal skies the image is large but blurry.</p>

<p>After that, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">seeing (or air turbulence)</a> pushes that limit further down. Your aperture is small enough that it almost never suffers from seeing, but larger instruments are often affected. It varies greatly with time, place and season. There are times when a 12"" dobsonian, that in theory could do 600x, is clamped down by seeing to 150 ... 180x. There are times when you could take a 20"" dobsonian all the way up to 1000x - but that's very, VERY rare, it's the stuff of legends.</p>

<p>Assuming average seeing conditions and instruments of usual size (refractors of 3...4"" aperture, reflectors 6"" or larger), here are some rules of thumb:</p>

<p>Jupiter is seen best under mid-high magnification. It's rare that more than 200x is beneficial. This is because it's a very low contrast object, and additional magnification comes at the cost of less contrast, which makes things worse.</p>

<p>Saturn works best at high-ish magnification, bit more than Jupiter but maybe not much more. Around 200 ... 250x usually works. It depends on what you do - if you're trying to see the ring divisions, push it a bit higher.</p>

<p>Mars can use the highest magnification that you could generate, given the instrument and the conditions. It's a very small object, contrast is not bad, so crank it all the way up. Most instruments are limited by seeing when observing Mars.</p>

<p>Moon is the same as Mars.</p>

<p>As you can see, magnification is never an issue for you. More magnification will not make it better. In fact, more magnification always means the image is more blurry, not more crisp - it's always a compromise between size and blurriness that decides the optimal magnification.</p>

<p>Don't worry, everyone begins thinking that more is always better. Soon enough, experience shows them what's really going on.</p>

<hr>

<p>That being said, I believe it's not magnification that's giving you trouble, but the general condition of the optical stack that you're using. These are things that are extremely important, and yet are ignored by many, many amateurs - and the results are not optimal. Here are a few things that you should investigate:</p>

<p><strong>Collimation</strong></p>

<p>Is your scope collimated? In other words, are all optical elements aligned on the same axis? The likely answer is no. It makes a huge difference in the scope's performance, especially for planets. Here's a collimated scope, compared to the same scope out of collimation:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dz4N8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQaDk.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Further information on <a href=""http://www.astrophoto.fr/collim.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thierry Legault's site</a>, which is extremely informative.</p>

<p>A series of articles and documents regarding collimation:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cloudynights.com/documents/primer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.cloudynights.com/documents/primer.pdf</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://garyseronik.com/a-beginners-guide-to-collimation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""A Beginner’s Guide to Collimation"">Gary Seronik: A Beginner’s Guide to Collimation</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://garyseronik.com/no-tools-telescope-collimation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""No-Tools Telescope Collimation"">Gary Seronik: No-Tools Telescope Collimation</a></p>

<p>Note: Some telescopes (e.g. pretty much all refractors) do not require collimation; they are collimated from factory and hold collimation pretty well. But most reflectors (SCTs, all newtonians including dobsonians, etc) do require this periodic maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Thermal equilibrium</strong></p>

<p>At 3"" aperture, this is probably not a big issue, but there's no reason why you should add another problem to the existing ones. Your scope should be at the same temperature as the air around it, otherwise its performance decreases. Take it outside 1 hour before you start observing, and that should be enough for you.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FkCIj.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Larger telescopes (around 6"" ... 8"" and larger) should use active ventilation for better cooling (a fan on the back of the mirror). More details here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://garyseronik.com/beat-the-heat-conquering-newtonian-reflector-thermals-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Beat the Heat: Conquering Newtonian Reflector Thermals — Part 1"">Gary Seronik: Beat the Heat: Conquering Newtonian Reflector Thermals — Part 1</a></p>

<p>In your case, simple passive cooling for 1 hour should be enough, but it's worth reading those articles.</p>

<p><strong>Focal ratio</strong></p>

<p>A 3"" scope, at 300mm focal length, that's an f/4 instrument. That's a pretty steep f/ ratio. Most eyepieces will not do well with such a blunt cone of light, and will start to exhibit aberrations that blur the image. Only very expensive eyepieces work well at such low focal ratios - things like TeleVue Ethos, or Explore Scientific 82 degree eyepieces.</p>

<p>Try and keep the planet in the center - most aberrations are lower there. Even very simple eyepieces do better in the middle of the image.</p>

<p>Look at the stars. Are they tiny and round in the center, and large and fuzzy at the edge? Those are aberrations from various sources (eyepiece, primary mirror, etc).</p>

<p><strong>Coma</strong></p>

<p>Of course, at f/4 even the best eyepieces out there cannot do anything about coma - an aberration coming out of any parabolic mirror, which becomes pretty obvious around f/5, very obvious at f/4, and a major problem at f/3. Again, coma is zero in the center of the image, and increases towards the edge.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QiILH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A coma corrector is used in some cases, such as the TeleVue Paracorr, but I strongly recommend that you DO NOT use one - I suspect your instrument is aberrating in ways that overwhelm coma anyway. Jupiter would not be too blurry even at full f/4 coma at the edge. This paragraph is for informational purposes only.</p>

<p>Coma should become a concern with large telescopes, using high quality optics, with a focal ratio of around f/5 and less. E.g., you have a 20"" dob with an f/4 mirror, then you should worry about coma - provided that collimation and so on are taken care of.</p>

<p><strong>Optics quality</strong></p>

<p>An f/4 parabola is not super easy to make at any size. I've made my own optics, and the lower the f/ ratio, the more difficult the process is. Many small, cheap telescopes are made in a hurry, and the difficult focal ratio poses additional problems - as a result, many manufacturers do a poor job. There are even cases where the primary mirror is left spherical, with disastrous results.</p>

<p>This is something you can do nothing about. If the primary mirror is bad, then that's just the way things are. An optician might try to correct it, but it's a difficult process, and quite expensive. I only added this here so you are informed.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is what I would do in your case:</p>

<p>I would take the scope out 1 hour before observing, every time.</p>

<p>I would try and learn how to collimate the scope. I would try to figure out a few simple collimation techniques, and a few simple tests. I would spend a few days / weeks practicing that. I would keep reading about collimation.</p>

<p>When collimation is at least partially under control, I would learn how to properly focus the scope. Seems simple, but it can be tricky. Use a bright star, and try and make it as small as possible. Use the Moon when it's visible, and try and make it crisp and clear. Do not try this with a miscollimated scope, since it's pointless.</p>

<p>After a few months, when I gain confidence that the scope is in better shape, very well collimated, very well focused, I might try to borrow a better eyepiece from a friend. I said borrow, not buy. Something like a 3 ... 4mm eyepiece, good quality, that would give me a comparison for the existing eyepieces. This ONLY makes sense with a scope that is in perfect collimation, perfect temperature, perfect focus. If an improvement is seen, then get a better eyepiece - but do not spend hundreds of dollars for an expensive eyepiece that will then be used in a tiny cheap scope. Second-hand eyepieces often work exactly as well as new ones.</p>

<p>If you know someone in your area who makes mirrors, see if they agree to put your primary mirror on the Foucault tester, and assess its condition. But beware: the results might be very disappointing. Or not. You kind of never know with these little scopes.</p>

<p>EDIT: After the scope is collimated and so on, you could try to increase magnification by using a 2x barlow with your eyepieces, but do not expect miracles - the image will be bigger, but probably rather ""mushy"". More magnification is not always better, there's always a trade-off.</p>

<p>Good luck, and clear skies to you!</p>

"What are the differences between matter, dark matter and antimatter?","35025","","<p>I thought dark and anti matter were kinda the same, but after saw a video, they mention that dark matter is not antimatter but their explanation is a little fast so I got doubts.</p>

<p>What are the differences between matter, dark matter and antimatter? Are they related? How they interact each other? Where can I see an example of this interaction? and also, in terms of percentage, how much of matter, dark matter and antimatter exist in the universe?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Matter is the stuff you are made of.</p>

<p>Antimatter is the same as matter in every way, looks the same, behaves the same, except its particles have electrical charges opposite to matter. E.g., our electrons are negatively charged, whereas a positron (an antimatter ""electron"") is positively charged. The positron is the ""anti-particle"" of the electron.</p>

<p>When a particle meets its anti-particle, they ""annihilate"": the two particles disappear, and gamma photons are released carrying off their energy. For this reason, should a lump of matter touch a lump of antimatter, they would annihilate, and a giant explosion would result because of the huge energy released (E=mc^2).</p>

<p>Matter and antimatter are definitely related: same thing, but with opposite signs. Twins, but opposites.</p>

<p>It is not clear why, but it seems like there isn't that much antimatter out there, more like trace amounts. Definitely not as much as regular matter as far as we can tell. This is puzzling to physicists and cosmologists, because you'd expect the Big Bang to make roughly equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Scientists agree that the paradox of ""excess matter"" will advance physics even further once it's solved.</p>

<hr>

<p>Dark matter - we don't really know what it is. It's not even sure it's ""matter"" in a conventional sense, or related to it in any way. We just know that galaxies are rotating in such a way that indicates there's a lot more mass out there, but it is mass that we cannot see and cannot be accounted for in the usual ways. Hence the name ""dark"" (as in invisible) matter.</p>

<p>Dark matter doesn't seem to interact much with regular matter, except gravitationally. Right now dark matter could be passing through you and you wouldn't notice. Dark matter also does not interact with light, so you can't see it. It doesn't seem to interact much with itself either, so for this reason dark matter cannot form ""clumps"" such as planets or stars. Instead, it probably exists in a diffuse form. Bottom line, dark matter interacts pretty much only via gravity.</p>

<p>The shape of galaxies is a proof of the existence of dark matter, and is a result of the interaction between matter and dark matter. Without dark matter, galaxies would be much less massive, and the outer parts would rotate much more slowly compared to the center. Due to dark matter, galaxies are quite massive, and they rotate almost as solid objects - the outer parts rotate approximately as fast as the central parts.</p>

<p>Estimates vary, but it seems like there's something like 5x to 6x more dark matter out there compared to regular matter.</p>

"Could this be a cosmic ray hit on my cameras sensor (CMOS, DSLR)?","27777","","<p>While taking pictures of the bubble nebula I noticed a very strange artifact on only one of my pictures.

There must be some way to get a <em>very rough</em> idea of how many $e^- h^+$ pairs correspond to a fully exposed pixel at ""@ISO1600"", then we could convert it to a dE/dx and see if it's minimum ionizing or if it's much higher.</p>

<p>Going diagonally, with a density of 2.3 g/cm${}^3$ that's about 1.3 mg/cm${}^2$ areal density per pixel. A [minimum ionizing particle] at 1.5 MeV / g cm${}^2$ would deposit only about 2000 eV which would make less than 1000 $e^- h^+$ pairs. That might correspond to a bright pixel. It's not out of the question that it's a minimum ionizing particle.</p>

"How long does a sunrise or sunset take?","27741","","<p>From the time that the sun appears on the horizon, or meets it on its setting, to the time that it is fully visible, or no longer visible on its setting, how much time passes?
Secondly, is there a place in the world where a sunrise/sunset occurs over a period of a few days? Meaning, that from the time it begins to appear over the horizon until it is fully visible, a period of a few days pass without night intervening (and the same for the opposite with sunset)?</p>
","<p>The time it takes depends on various factors: the angle that the path of the sun makes with the horizon is the main one, though there are also optical effects caused by the atmosphere have an effect too.</p>

<p>Generally the closer to the equator you live, the steeper is the angle, and so the faster is the sunset. </p>

<p>Using Stellarium I did a couple of tests:</p>

<li>In the UK (50 degrees North) on 10th December, it took the sun 4min 47s seconds to sink below a simulated horizon.</li>
<li>In Angloa (10 degrees south), on the same day it took 2min 26s for the sun to set.</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that in most populated regions, a sunset takes between 2 and 5 minutes.</p>

<p>There are locations, close to the Antarctic circle at this time of year, at which the sun merely partially sets, and then rises again. And at the Pole, the sun moves around in horizontal circles in the sky each day.

Some even say Pluto isn't a planet anymore either. </p>

<p>The result: I'm confused due to the contradicting stories. Even <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_%28dwarf_planet%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia isn't clear about Eris</a> and only writes (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NASA <strong><em>initially</em></strong> described it as the Solar System's tenth planet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially? So, is it a 10th planet or not? Fact is, there is another ""something"" out there and it surely seems to look like a planet. Yet, some people keep stating there are 9 planets in our solar system, while others say there are <em>more</em> than 9 planets, and then again there are people stating that the latest definition of ""planet"" has kicked out Pluto too so there are actually <em>fewer</em> than 9 planets in our solar system.</p>

<p>Trying to get a definite, official, and astronomically correct answer I can actually rely on, I'm therefore asking: <strong><em>How many planets are there in this solar system?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_planet"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Definition of planet"" at Wikipedia</a> doesn't really help either, as it states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many astronomers, claiming that the definition of planet was of little scientific importance, preferred to recognize Pluto's historical identity as a planet by ""grandfathering"" it into the planet list.*</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So, if you link somewhere to provide proof, it would be great if you could point me to a more trusted source than Wikipedia. Ideally, an astronomical trusted source and/or paper.</p>
","<p>Since we're talking about terminology, we need to remember that none of this <em>really</em> matters, outside of clarity when communicating. Still, some people tend to have rather strong opinions on it, thus confusion about how many planets are <em>really</em> in the solar system arises.</p>

<h2>The people</h2>

<p>The most trusted source in Astronomy would have to be the people that set the generally accepted rules. The <a href=""http://www.iau.org/about/"">IAU (International Astronomical Union)</a> has been in existence since 1919 and is comprised of 10814 Individual Members in 93 different countries worldwide. Of those countries, 73 are National Members.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key activity of the IAU is the organization of scientific meetings. Every year the IAU sponsors nine international IAU Symposia. The IAU Symposium Proceedings series is the flagship of the IAU publications. Every three years the IAU holds a General Assembly, which offers six IAU Symposia, some 25 Joint Discussions and Special Sessions, and individual business and scientific meetings of Divisions, Commissions, and Working Groups. The proceedings of Joint Discussions and Special Sessions are published in the Highlights of Astronomy series. The reports of the GA business meetings are published in the Transactions of the IAU - B series.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The definition</h2>

<p>At the 2006 IAU General Assembly in Prague, the accepted definition of a planet was debated vigorously. The outcome of the meeting was the currently accepted definition of a planet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What about Pluto?</h2>

<p>With this in mind, the group decided on Pluto's fate. From page 2 of <a href=""http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/Resolution_GA26-5-6.pdf"">this official resolution document:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The IAU further resolves: </p>
  
  <p>Pluto is a ""dwarf planet"" by the above definition and is recognized as the 
  prototype of a new category of Trans-Neptunian Objects. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason given in the FAQ on <a href=""http://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto/"">this page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: Why is Pluto now called a dwarf planet?</strong> </p>
  
  <p>A: Pluto now falls into the dwarf planet category on account of its size and the fact that it resides within a zone of other similarly-sized objects known as the transneptunian region. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, they decided that it isn't officially a planet anymore because it didn't match criteria <em>(c): has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.</em> It hasn't done this, because it 'resides within a zone of <strong>other similarly-sized objects</strong>'. Therefore, it hasn't cleared its neighborhood.</p>

<h2>Soo... what about the number of planets?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: Based on this new definition, how many planets are there in our Solar System?</strong></p>
  
  <p>A: There are eight planets in our Solar System; Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Mnemonic: My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that's if you don't count Dwarf planets - if you <em>do</em> count them, you end up with <a href=""http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Dwarf&amp;Display=Sats"">five more</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ceres</li>
<li>Pluto</li>
<li>Eris</li>
<li>Makemake</li>
<li>Haumea</li>
</ul>

<p>So there are <strong>8</strong> planets in the solar system if you don't count Dwarfs, <strong>13</strong> if you do.</p>

<p>So, which constellations is the Sun assigned to?  Well, from the perspective of someone on the Earth, the Sun moves through the constellations throughout the course of the year.  Or rather, Sol moves through the region of the sky where <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology#The_zodiac"" rel=""noreferrer"">some of the constellations</a> would be seen if its light did not drown out distant stars.  Our moon and the rest of the planets move through those same constellations.  (The Greek phrase which gives us the word <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet"" rel=""noreferrer"">""planet""</a> means ""wandering star"".)</p>

<p>The current position of the sun against the background of distant stars changes over the course of the year.  (This is important for <a href=""http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/starfinder2/"" rel=""noreferrer"">astrology</a>.)  It's a little easier to make sense of with a diagram:</p>

"Did atoms in human body indeed come from stars?","21107","","<p>I think I am not alone who saw videos about that we (humans) are made of same atoms which someday were in stars. In other words, some atoms in our bodies are from stars which exploded billions of years ago.</p>

<p>I wonder if it is indeed true. I mean human's life begins when sperm cell fertilize egg cell. Now does that sperm cell or egg cell indeed contains some of the exact atoms from those stars? </p>

<p>I know little bit strange question, but would be interesting to hear if it is indeed true, that atoms in our body are same which someday were in stars.</p>

","<p>When the first atoms came into being in the early universe they were mainly hydrogen (the smallest atoms there are) and some helium. All over the universe those atoms lumped together under gravity until the pressure and temperature became so high that the hydrogen atoms fused together to form heavier elements. The reaction is nuclear fusion, and it's the engine of all stars. First hydrogen fuses to form helium, and then in a cascade helium atoms fuse to form heavier elements.</p>

<p>Many stars die as a supernova, without doubt the most violent explosions in the universe. The supernova which was just a single star becomes as bright as the complete galaxy it's part of. Remember that such a galaxy typically consists of 100 billion stars.</p>

<p>During the supernova explosion all the elements from helium to the most heavy elements are thrown into space. Later they will coalesce to form planets around new stars. So indeed, everything the earth consists of comes from such an exploding star.</p>

<p>And the next step is life. A single cell consists mainly of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, all ultimately coming from the earth. For instance a plant will take these elements from the soil and the air, and we animals get it from plants. So the elements from the soil, which came from stars, ultimately ends up in each of our cells.</p>

","<p>A moonless night is, as you suspect, <strong>a night in which the Moon does not appear visible in the sky</strong>. This happens once per month, when the Moon is near the Sun. Due to the proximity of the Moon and the Sun in the sky, at that time the Moon is the smallest sliver possible, and therefore <strong>not</strong> a full moon.</p>

<p>Assuming that human beings, or life, still exists on Earth at that time, they will have survived so much due to the ongoing death of the sun, that the gravitational pertubations due to the galactic collision will be nothing.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that in about 1-2 billion years, the sun will be so hot and large that all the water will have boiled off the earth into space.  About 3 billion years from now, the surface of the Earth will be so hot that metals will be melting.</p>

<p>Any life that has survived those events and still lives on Earth will surely take a galactic collision in stride.</p>

<p>I imagine, though, that most humans will have fled Earth - if not for distant star systems, then at least for planets in our own system that are going to be warming up enough for human habitation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we are about to collide in next 4 billion year then how long before we should take action for inter-stellar voyage? </p>

<p>As soon as possible. When interstellar voyage becomes possible, we should start sending out ships to colonize other planets and star systems.  This will likely take a long time, but if we are to survive more than a billion years, it is necessary. Keep in mind that the Sun and Andromeda are events we can predict.  We don't know, and can't predict, the next cataclysmic asteroid strike, which is likely to happen in a shorter time than a billion years.  There are lots of reasons to exit the planet, we should be worried about the ones we can't predict or see, not the ones we can predict.</p>

<p>Yes, but in small steps.  Manned missions to space, to the moon, and living aboard the ISS have provided significantly valuable information that will be used in such interstellar missions.  As we continue to push the boundaries of our ability to survive in space we eventually will be able to live in space, perhaps whole lifetimes will be spent in space.  As engine technology progresses beyond simply lifting people out of Earth's gravitational well, we will eventually be sending people on long voyages outside our solar system.</p>

","<p>The Moon has an orbital eccentricity of 0.0549, so its path around the Earth is not perfectly circular and the distance between the Earth and the Moon will vary from the Earth's frame of reference (Perigee at 363,295 km and apogee at 405,503 km), see for example <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/22/13"">second animation explaining Lunar librations in this answer</a>.</p>

"How does neutron star collapse into black hole?","19101","","<p>We know the spectacular explosions of supernovae, that when heavy enough, form black holes. The explosive emission of both electromagnetic radiation and massive amounts of matter is clearly observable and studied quite thoroughly. If the star was massive enough, the remnant will be a black hole. If it wasn't massive enough, it will be a neutron star.</p>

<p>Now there's another mode of creation of black holes: the neutron star captures enough matter, or two neutron stars collide, and their combined mass creates enough gravity force to cause another collapse - into a black hole.</p>

<p>What effects are associated with this? Is there an explosive release of some kind of radiation or particles? Is it observable? What physical processes occur in the neutrons as they are subjected to the critical increase of pressure? What is the mass of the new black hole, comparing to its neutron star of origin?</p>
","<p>A neutron star must have a minimum mass of at least 1.4x solar masses (that is, 1.4x mass of our Sun) in order to become a neutron star in the first place.
See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chandrasekhar limit</a> on wikipedia for details.</p>

<p>A neutron star is formed during a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">supernova</a>, an explosion of a star that is at least 8 solar masses.</p>

<p>The maximum mass of a neutron star is 3 solar masses. If it gets more massive than that, then it will collapse into a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_star"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quark star</a>, and then into a black hole.</p>

<p>We know that 1 electron + 1 proton = 1 neutron;</p>

<p>1 neutron = 3 quarks = up quark + down quark + down quark;</p>

<p>1 proton = 3 quarks = up quark + up quark + down quark;</p>

<p>A supernova results in either a neutron star (between 1.4 and 3 solar masses), a quark star(about 3 solar masses), or a black hole(greater than 3 solar masses), which is the remaining collapsed core of the star.</p>

<p>During a supernova, most of the stellar mass is blown off into space, forming elements heavier than iron which cannot be generated through stellar nucleosynthesis, because beyond iron, the star requires more energy to fuse the atoms than it gets back.</p>

<p>During the supernova collapse, the atoms in the core break up into electrons, protons and neutrons.</p>

<p>In the case that the supernova results in a neutron star core, the electrons and protons in the core are merged to become neutrons, so the newly born 20-km-diameter neutron star containing between 1.4 and 3 solar masses is like a giant atomic nucleus containing only neutrons.</p>

<p>If the neutron star's mass is then increased, neutrons become degenerate, breaking up into their constituent quarks, thus the star becomes a quark star; a further increase in mass results in a black hole.</p>

<p>The upper/lower mass limit for a quark star is not known (or at least I couldn't find it), in any case, it is a narrow band around 3 solar masses, which is the minimum stable mass of a black hole.</p>

<p>When you talk about a black hole with a stable mass (at least 3 solar masses), it is good to consider that they come in 4 flavors: rotating-charged, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rotating-uncharged</a>, non-rotating-charged, non-rotating-uncharged.</p>

<p>What we would see visually during the transformation would be a hard radiation flash.
This is because during the collapse, the particles on/near the surface have time to emit hard radiation as they break up before going into the event horizon; so this could be one of the causes of gamma ray bursts (GRBs).</p>

<p>We know that atoms break up into protons, neutrons, electrons under pressure.</p>

<p>Under more pressure, protons and electrons combine into neutrons.</p>

<p>Under even more pressure, neutrons break down into quarks.</p>

<p>Under still more pressure, perhaps quarks break down into still smaller particles.</p>

<p>Ultimately the smallest particle is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">string</a>: open or closed loop, and has a Planck length, which is many orders of magnitude smaller than a quark. if a string is magnified so it is 1 millimeter in length, then a proton would have a diameter that would fit snugly between the Sun and Epsilon Eridani, 10.5 light years away; that's how big a proton is compared to a string, so you can imagine there are perhaps quite a few intermediate things between quarks and strings.</p>

<p>Currently it looks like several more decades will be needed to figure out all the math in string theory, and if there is anything smaller than strings then a new theory will be required, but so far string theory looks good; see the book <strong>Elegant Universe</strong> by Brian Greene.</p>

<p>A string is pure energy and Einstein said mass is just a form of energy, so the collapse into a black hole really breaks down the structure of energy that gives the appearance of mass/matter/baryonic particles, and leaves the mass in its most simple form, open or closed strings, that is, pure energy bound by gravity.</p>

<p>We know that black holes (which are not really holes or singularities, as they do have mass, radius, rotation, charge and hence density, which varies with radius) can <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">evaporate</a>, giving up their entire mass in the form of radiation, thus proving they are actually energy. Evaporation of a black hole occurs if its mass is below the minimum mass of a stable black hole, which is 3 solar masses; the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Schwarzschild radius</a> equation even tells you what the radius of a black hole is given its mass, and vice versa.</p>

<p>So you could transform anything you want, such as your pencil, into a black hole if you wanted to, and could compress it into the required size for it to become a black hole; it is just that it would immediately transform itself (evaporate) completely into a flash of hard radiation, because a pencil is less than the stable black hole mass (3 solar masses).</p>

<p>This is why the CERN experiment could never have created a black hole to swallow the Earth - a subatomic black hole, even one with the mass of the entire Earth, or the Sun, would evaporate before swallowing anything; there is not enough mass in our solar system to make a stable (3 solar mass) black hole.</p>

<p>A simple way for a neutron star to become more massive in order to be able to turn into a black hole is to be part of a binary system, where it is close enough to another star that the neutron star and its binary pair orbit each other, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataclysmic_variable"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the neutron star siphons off gas from the other star</a>, thus gaining mass.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VCcfj.jpg"" alt=""Cataclysmic variable binary""></p>

<p>Here is a nice drawing showing exactly that.</p>

<p>Matter falling into a black hole is accelerated toward light speed. As it is accelerated, the matter breaks down into subatomic particles and hard radiation, that is, X-rays and gamma rays. A black hole itself is not visible, but the light from infalling matter that is accelerated and broken up into particles is visible. Black holes can also cause a gravitational lens effect on the light of background stars/galaxies.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ralfvandebergh.startje.be/"">Vandebergh's personal page</a> also hosts all kinds of other successful observations of the ISS through his telescope and recorded in both photographs as well as some short videos. <strong>Why short? Because targeting the ISS as it moves at the speed of <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=iss%20speed"">4.8 mi/s (7.7 km/s)</a> is rather tricky, and the atmospheric conditions and times at which the ISS passes over some area on the surface of the Earth don't make it any easier either</strong>.

"Why did Venus not lose its atmosphere without magnetic field?","16000","","<p>It is often stated that the magnetosphere not only shields the planet from cosmic radiation, but also prevents atmosphere loss. Why did then Venus not lose most of its atmosphere if it doesn't have a strong magnetic field? Is there another mechanism at play, or is the statement about the importance of magnetosphere to atmosphere loss prevention wrong? </p>
","<p>There is an interesting article on the magnetosphere of Venus on the ESA Science and Technology site. You can find the article <a href=""http://sci.esa.int/venus-express/50246-a-magnetic-surprise-for-venus-express/"">here</a> and it will probably answer your question.</p>

<p>The article states, like you did, that there are planets, like Earth, Mercury, Jupiter and saturn, have magnetic fields interland induced by there iron core. These magnetic fields shield the atmosphere from particles coming from solar winds. It also confirms your statement that Venus lacks this intrinsic magnetosphere to shield its atmosphere from the solar winds. </p>

<p>The interesting thing, however, is that spacecraft observations, like the ones made by ESA's Venus Express, have shown that the ionosphere of Venus direct interaction with the solar winds causes an externally induced magnetic field, which deflects the particles from the solar winds and protects the atmosphere from being blown away from the planet.</p>

<p>However, the article also explains that the Venus magnetosphere is not as protective as earth's magnetosphere. Measurements of the Venus magnetic field show several similarities, such as deflection of the solar winds and the reconnections in the tail of the magnetosphere, causing plasma circulations in the magnetosphere. The differences might explain the fact that some gasses and water are lost from the Venus atmosphere. The magnetic field of Venus is about 10 times smaller as the earth's magnetic field. The shape of the magnetic field is also different. Earth has a more sharp magnetotail facing away from the sun and Venus has a more comet shaped magnetotail. During the reconnections most of the plasma is lost in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The article explains therefore that although Venus does not have an intrinsic magnetic field, but the interaction of the thick atmosphere with the solar winds causes an externally induced magnetic field, that deflect the particles of the solar winds. The article suggests, however, that the different magnetic field may cause that lighter gasses are not that much protected and therefore are lost into space.</p>

<li>Has it changed and will it change in the future? (If so, would there be any consequences?)</li>
</ul>
","<p>First up, the tilt is exactly 23.45 degrees. </p>

<p>The reason for Earth's tilt is still not yet really proven, but <a href=""https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S15/64/72A37/index.xml?section=newsreleases"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">scientists at Princeton stated on August 25, 2006</a> that planet Earth may have 'tilted' to keep its balance. Quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By analyzing the magnetic composition of ancient sediments found in the remote Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, Princeton University's Adam Maloof has lent credence to a 140-year-old theory regarding the way the Earth might restore its own balance if an unequal distribution of weight ever developed in its interior or on its surface.</p>
  
  <p>The theory, known as true polar wander, postulates that if an object of sufficient weight -- such as a supersized volcano -- ever formed far from the equator, the force of the planet's rotation would gradually pull the heavy object away from the axis the Earth spins around. If the volcanoes, land and other masses that exist within the spinning Earth ever became sufficiently imbalanced, the planet would tilt and rotate itself until this extra weight was relocated to a point along the equator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same goes for the lack of proof about the exact consequences on the planet or if it'll happen again. All that is still being researched and debated, but those Princeton scientists have thrown in some interesting perspectives which you'll discover when you visit the link I provided and completely read what they wrote.</p>

<p>Besides ""consequences"" for Earth as a planet, it should be noted that the tilt of Earth is the reason why we have seasons. So even when we yet have to find out what the consequences for Earth (as a planet) have been and/or will be, we do know that the tilt surely has consequences for all beings that live on planet Earth… the seasons that influence us all: summer, fall, winter, and spring.</p>

<p>And - last but not least - as for your question how they know where 0 degrees would be, you just have to look at the Earth's rotation around the sun. Take a 90° angle of the planet's orbit and you know where 0° would be. But I guess a picture explains more than a thousand words, so I quickly created the following graphic:</p>

<p>I mean for example if i'm laying down on the earth since sunset looking at the stars, and let's say I'm close to the equator, no matter the distance, I'll be looking at the stars and earth will turn about 180° until sunrise, so my angle of view will be about 180°.</p>
","<p>This is referred to as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_motion"" rel=""noreferrer"">diurnal motion</a>, due to Earth's rotation on its axis, and it affects apparent motion of stars differently depending on their position on the skies relative to the axis of Earth's rotation. For example, on northern hemisphere, the star that appears not to move at all is positioned so that the earth's axis of rotation points directly towards it, and is called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris"" rel=""noreferrer"">Polaris</a> due to its role as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_Star"" rel=""noreferrer"">pole star</a>.

<p>So what you assert, that the stars don't seem to move isn't exactly true. Stars closer to celestial equator will move at equal apparent radial velocity as any object <em>fixed</em> on the night skies would (so at the speed of Earth's rotation), while the stars closer to celestial poles, while maintaining this radial velocity, will prescribe a smaller circle and appear to be more stationary. And the stars exactly aligned with the Earth's axis (like Polaris, but there isn't any such exact counterpart on the southern hemisphere), would appear not to move at all.</p>

","<p>The answer to this is surprising:</p>

<p>We are.</p>

<p>And many (if not all) other galaxies.</p>

<p>And they move faster than light.</p>

<p>See, the universe is expanding, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">at an accelerating rate</a>. The fabric of spacetime itself stretches out, so that galaxies seem to move away from each other. The interesting thing is that relativity does not forbid these from moving away faster than light. While <em>local</em> space is flat and the local speed of light must be upheld, this need not hold at a global scale, so it is possible to have frames which move away from each other faster than $c$. Indeed, <a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">there are some galaxies that are moving away from us faster than light</a> (<a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=56"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the only reason we see them is that they used to be closer and moving at a slower speed</a>). Any pair of galaxies that are 4200 Mpc away from each other (that is, with a redshift of 1.4), are moving away from each other faster than light in each other's frames (numbers stolen from the linked page).</p>

<p>Since the only consistent way to talk about motion is relative, one can say that we are moving away from other galaxies faster than light, since the reverse is also true. This can put galaxies in the bucket of the fastest moving objects in the universe. As for <em>which</em> is the fastest, I don't know, we would have to find a pair of galaxies which are the farthest apart (distance measured in the frame of the galaxy, of course), but since the universe is probably more than what we observe<sup>1</sup>, we can't pinpoint the pair of galaxies for which this is true.</p>

<hr>

<p>For those who think that it is cheating<sup>2</sup> to short-circuit the question with space expansion, there are other objects that go faster than light (they are not the fastest objects in the universe though), and these can be found on good 'ol Earth.</p>

<p>In nuclear reactor cooling pools<sup>3</sup>, we have a phenomenon known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cerenkov radiation</a>. Basically, emitted beta particles move faster than the speed of light in water. This creates an effect of similar origin as the sonic boom, where strong light emanates from the medium. </p>

<p>Saywhat? You think I'm cheating again<sup>2</sup> by putting everything relative to the speed of light in a medium?</p>

<p>Alright, fine. Here are some fast objects that <em>don't</em> require space expansion to be fast, nor do they involve any trickery of semantics where the medium in which they are being measured is not mentioned. Many have already been mentioned by astromax.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyons"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tachyons</a></strong>:These are particles which go faster than $c$ &mdash; this does not violate relativity as long as they never decelerate to subluminal speeds. However, there isn't much (any?) experimental evidence for these. A lot of BSM models do predict their existence, though. So there's still some cheating here, on to bradyonic matter:</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gluons</a></strong>: These are massless, and though they don't occur freely (except possibly in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glueball"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glueballs</a>, though these most probably have mass) they do travel <em>at</em> $c$. But these can't move at any other speed, so again, this is slightly cheating. On to fermionic matter:</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrinos"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Neutrinos</a></strong>: Now these are viable candidates. The electron neutrino is known to have very, very little mass (we have an upper bound for it, which gives ), and as a result it can easily attain very high speeds. Put it in a gravitational field, and it goes even faster. If you want macroscopic objects, however:</p></li>
<li><strong>Stuff spiraling around spinning black holes</strong>: Black holes have a strong gravitational field, and when rotating, they can impart angular momentum (lots of it) to nearby objects like accretion disks. Objects close to a black hole are accelerated to pretty high speeds. In fact, if an object is within the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergosphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ergosphere</a>, it moves faster than light from the point of view of certain frames of reference.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff falling into black holes</strong>: From the faraway frame, an object speeds up and approaches the speed of light as it approaches the horizon of a black hole. Arbitrarily large speeds bounded by $c$ can be attained here.</li>
<li><strong>Black hole plasma jets</strong>: Jets being flung out of black holes can get pretty fast relative to each other.</li>

"How was the Earth-Sun distance originally calculated?","14968","","<p>AFAIK it was possible long before the first interplanetary probes.</p>

<p>Who did it?</p>
","<p>The book <em>The Transits of Venus</em>, by Sheehan and Westfall, describes how Aristarchus used Hipparchus' calculation of the Earth-Moon distance, who in turn used Eratosthenes' calculation of the Earth's circumference, to calculate the Earth-Sun distance.</p>

<p>Aristarchus of Samos was the first to seriously calculate the distance to the Sun, using geometry.  When the Moon is exactly half illuminated when seen from the Earth (first or last quarter phase), then there is a right triangle between the Earth, Moon, and Sun, with the Moon at the right angle.  Then he could measure the angular distance in the sky between the Sun and the Moon, plus the Earth-Moon distance and geometry, to get the Earth-Sun distance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most famous ancient estimate of the earth's circumference as made by Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 276-196 BCE), the librarian at the great library at Alexandria.  By using a simple gnomon, he found that at Syene, ... the sun at the summer solstice cast no shadow at all: it was exactly overhead.  ... At the same moment, at Alexandria, the shadow cast by the sun shows that it stood 7.2 degrees from vertical.  This difference is equal to 1/50 of a circle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the distance between the cities, Earth's circumference could be calculated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once the earth's radius is known, the earth itself can be used as a baseline for determining still greater distances -- the distance to the moon.</p>
  
  <p>[I]t becomes possible to work out the earth-moon distance indirectly from the geometry of [lunar] eclipses.  Using this method, Hipparchus of Rhodes (fl. 140 BCE) worked out that the distance of the moon was 59 earth radii.  It's a good approximation - with 1 1/2 or 2 earth radii of the modern value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the Earth-Moon distance and the separation of the Moon from the Sun in the sky when the Moon was at exactly half-phase, Aristarchus calculated the Earth-Sun distance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aristarchus put forward a geometrical argument, based on determining the sun-earth-moon angle at the time the moon's phase is exactly half.  For this angle, which is actually 89.86 degrees, Aristarchus used 87 degrees; the disagreement is more significant that it might appear because the critical quantity is the <em>difference</em> between the angle and 90 degrees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of this Aristarchus only got a value of the equivalent of ""5 million miles"", much too small.</p>

<p>Phil Plait has, on his old Bad Astronomy site, an article answering a question about <a href=""http://www.badastronomy.com/mad/1996/au.html"">how astronomers originally calculated the distance from the Earth to the Sun</a> (the AU, or astronomical unit).</p>

<p>Huygens was the first to calculate this distance with any kind of accuracy at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So how did Huygens do it? He knew that Venus showed phases when viewed through a telescope, just like our own Moon does. He also knew that the actual phase of Venus depended on the angle it made with the Sun as seen from the Earth. When Venus is between the Earth and Sun, the far side is lit, and so we see Venus as being dark. When Venus is on the far side of the Sun from the Earth, we can see the entire half facing us as lit, and Venus looks like a full Moon. When Venus, the Sun and Earth form a right angle, Venus looks half lit, like a half Moon.</p>
  
  <p>Now, if you can measure any two internal angles in a triangle, and know the length of one of its sides, you can determine the length of another side. Since Huygens knew the Sun-Venus-Earth angle (from the phases), and he could directly measure the Sun-Earth-Venus angle (simply by measuring Venus' apparent distance from the Sun on the sky) all he needed was to know the distance from Earth to Venus. Then he could use some simple trigonometry to get the Earth-Sun distance.</p>
  
  <p>This is where Huygens tripped up. He knew that if you measured the apparent size of an object, and knew its true size, you could find the distance to that object. Huygens thought he knew the actual size of Venus using such unscientific techniques as numerology and mysticism. Using these methods he thought that Venus was the same size as the Earth. As it turn out, that is correct! Venus is indeed very close to being the same size as the Earth, but in this case he got it right by pure chance. But since he had the right number, he wound up getting the about the correct number for the AU.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, Huygens used good methods, except for using ""numerology and mysticism"" to determine the size of Venus.  He was lucky that Venus was almost the size of Earth; that made his estimate for the AU pretty close.</p>

<p>Not long after, Cassini used the parallax of Mars to determine the AU.  (Same article as linked above.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1672, Cassini used a method involving parallax on Mars to get the AU, and his method <em>was</em> correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parallax is the apparent difference in angle observed due to the differing observing positions.  The smaller the parallax, the larger the distance.</p>

<p>However, the precision of the resultant calculation depends on the precision of the observations, and measurements of the parallax aren't that precise.</p>

<p>In 1716, Edmond Halley published a way to use a transit of Venus to accurately measure the solar parallax, i.e. the difference in the Sun's position in the sky due to observers at different latitudes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of the latitude difference of the observers, Venus would appear to move along chords of different length over the disk of the sun.  The motion of Venus being nearly uniform, the length of each chord would be proportional with the duration of the transit.  Thus, observers would not actually have to <em>measure</em> anything; they would only have to <em>time</em> the transit.  Fortunately, existing pendulum clocks were more than sufficiently accurate for this purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They could time the transit, which would last hours, with great precision.  But they had to wait until the next transit of Venus in 1761.  Then, observers observed the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_drop_effect"">black drop effect</a>, which made it very hard to time the event from start to finish precisely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The black drop effect cannot be eliminated altogether, but it is much more ever in observations made with telescopes of imperfect optical quality (as many of those used at the 1761 transit were) and in boiling or unsteady air.  Confusion about the times of the internal contacts ... yielded contact times that differed among observers, because of the black drop, by as much as 52 seconds.</p>
  
  <p>In the end, there as a wide range of published values, from 8.28 arc-seconds to 10.60 arc-seconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then there was the transit of 1769.  Observations in Norway and in the Hudson Bay were made for the northern observations, and Captain James Cook was sent to what is now Tahiti to make a southerly observation.  Jérôme Lalande compiled the figures and calculated a solar parallax of 8.6 arc-seconds, close to the modern figure of about 8.794 arc-seconds.  That calculation yielded the first fairly accurate calculation of the Earth-Sun distance, of 24,000 Earth radii, which given the Earth's radius of 6,371 km, about 153,000,000 km, the accepted value being about 149,600,000 km.</p>

"Why don't astronomers use meters to measure astronomical distances?","14703","","<p>In astronomy distances are generally expressed in non-metric units like: light-years, astronomical units (AU), parsecs, etc. Why don't they use meters (or multiples thereof) to measure distances, as these are the SI unit for distance? Since the meter is already used in particle physics to measure the size of atoms, why couldn't it be used in astrophysics to measure the large distances in the Universe? </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ISS orbits about 400 km above Earth.</li>
<li>The diameter of the Sun is 1.39 Gm (gigameters).</li>
<li>The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy is 23 Zm (zettameters).</li>
<li>At its furthest point, Pluto is 5.83 Tm (terameters) from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: some have answered that meters are too small and therefore not intuitive for measuring large distances, however there are plenty of situations where this is not a problem, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bytes are used for measuring gigantic amounts of data, for example terabytes (1e+12) or petabytes (1e+15)</li>
<li>The energy released by large explosions is usually expressed in megatons, which is based on grams (1e+12)</li>
<li>The SI unit Hertz is often expressed in gigahertz (1e+9) or terahertz (1e+12) for measuring network frequencies or processor clock speeds.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the main reason for not using meters is historical, is it reasonable to expect that SI-unites will become the standard in astronomy, like most of the world switched from native to SI-units for everyday measurements? </p>
","<p>In addition to the answer provided by @HDE226868, there are historical reasons. Before the advent of using radar ranging to find distances in the solar system, we had to use other clever methods for finding the distance from the Earth to the sun; for example, <A HREF=""https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2004/28may_cook/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">measuring the transit of Venus across the surface of the sun</A>. These methods are not as super accurate as what is available today, so it makes sense to specify distances, that are all based on measuring parallaxes, in terms of the uncertain, but fixed, Earth-Sun distance. That way, if future measurements change the conversion value from AU to meters, you don't have to change as many papers and textbooks.</p>

<p>Not to mention that such calibration uncertainties introduce correlated errors into an analysis that aren't defeatable using large sample sizes.</p>

<p>I can't speak authoritatively on the actual history, but solar system measurements were all initially done in terms of the Earth/sun distance. For example, a little geometry shows that it's pretty straightforward to back out the size of Venus's and Mercury's orbit in AU from their maximum solar elongation. I don't know how they worked out the orbital radii of Mars, etc, but they were almost certainly done in AU long before the AU was known, and all of that before the MKS system existed, let alone became standardized. </p>

<p>For stars, the base of what is known as the ""cosmological distance ladder"" (that is ""all distance measures"" in astronomy) rests on measuring the parallax angle:
$$\tan \pi_{\mathrm{angle}} = \frac{1 AU}{D}.$$
To measure $D$ in 'parsecs' is to setup the equation so that the angle being measured in arcseconds fits the small angle approximation. That is:
$$\frac{D}{1\, \mathrm{parsec}} = \frac{\frac{\pi}{180\times60\times60}}{\tan\left(\pi_{\mathrm{angle}} \frac{\pi\, \mathrm{radians}}{180\times60\times60 \, \mathrm{arcsec}}\right)}$$</p>

<p>Astronomers also have a marked preference for the close cousin of mks/SI units, known as <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second_system_of_units"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cgs</A>. As far as I can tell, this is due to the influence of spectroscopists who liked the ""Gaussian units"" part of it for electromagnetism because it set Coulomb's constant to 1, simplifying calculations.</p>

"Why do Black Holes in the middle of galaxies not suck up the whole galaxy?","14089","","<p>As stated in several sources, it's supposed that in every galaxy there is a black hole in the middle.</p>

<p>My question is, <em>why do these black holes in the middle of galaxies not suck up all the surrounding matter in the galaxy?</em></p>
","<p>You shouldn't think of black holes as ""sucking things in"". Black holes interact with matter through gravity, just the same as any other object. Think of our Solar System. All the planets orbit around the sun because it has a lot of mass. Since the planets have some lateral motion (they're not moving directly towards or away from the sun), they circle around it. This is known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum#Conservation_of_angular_momentum"" rel=""noreferrer"">conservation of angular momentum</a>.</p>

<p>When talking about gravity, all that matters is the mass of the objects involved. It doesn't really matter what kind of object it is*. If you were to replace the sun with a black hole that had the same mass as our sun, the planets would continue on the exact same orbits as before.</p>

<p>Now, the black holes at the centers of most spiral galaxies do accumulate mass. Some of these black holes have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk"" rel=""noreferrer"">accretion disks</a> around them. These are swirling disks of gas and dust that is slowly falling into the black hole. These gas and dust particles lose their angular momentum through interactions with gas and dust nearby and by radiating energy as heat. Some of these black holes have very large accretion disks, and can generate huge amounts of electromagnetic radiation. These are known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk"" rel=""noreferrer"">active galactic nuclei</a>.</p>

<p>So, long story short, black holes don't ""suck"". They just interact with things gravitationally. Stars, gas, and other matter in the galaxy has angular momentum, so it stays in orbit around the center of the galaxy. It doesn't just fall straight in. This is the same reason the Earth orbits around the Sun. </p>

<p>*Disclaimer: When you talk about things like tidal forces, you do need to take into account the size of the objects. But for orbital mechanics, we don't need to worry about it because the distances between the objects are generally much larger than the objects themselves.</p>

"How to calculate the expected surface temperature of a planet","12456","","<p>I'm writing a program to generate solar systems but I'm having trouble calculating the expected temperature of a planet.

<p>$$T ^ 4 = \frac{ L_{\odot}(1 - a)}{16  \pi  d ^ 2 ơ}\;.$$</p>

<p>$$σ = 5.670373 × 10^{−8} \;\mathrm{W}\; \mathrm{m}^{−2}\; \mathrm{K}^{−4}.$$</p>

<p>The albedo is dimensionless. The resulting temperature will be in Kelvins. Let me make an example for Earth:</p>

<p>$d = 149,000,000,000 \;\mathrm{m}$</p>

<p>$L = 3.846×10^{26} \;\mathrm{W}$</p>

<p>Albedo of Earth is 0.29. (The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_albedo"" rel=""nofollow"">Bond albedo</a> should be used.) You will get</p>

"What would the effects be on Earth if Jupiter was turned into a star?","12408","","<p>In Clarke's book 2010, the monolith and its brethren turned Jupiter into the small star nicknamed <code>Lucifer</code>.  Ignoring the reality that we won't have any magical monoliths appearing in our future, what would the effects be on Earth if Jupiter was turned into a star?</p>

<p>At it's closest and furthest:  </p>

<p>How bright would the ""back-side"" of the earth be with light from Lucifer?  </p>

<p>How much heat would the small star generate on earth?  </p>

<p>How many days or months would we actually have night when we circled away behind the sun?</p>

<p>How much brighter would the sun-side of earth be when Lucifer and the sun both shine on the same side of the planet?</p>
","<p>Before I start, I'll admit that I've criticized the question based on its improbability; however, I've been persuaded otherwise. I'm going to try to do the calculations based on completely different formulas than I think have been used; I hope you'll stay with me as I work it out.</p>

<p>Let's imagine that Lucifer becomes a main-sequence star - in fact, let's call it a low-mass red dwarf. Main-sequence stars follow the mass-luminosity relation:</p>

<p>$$\frac{L}{L_\odot} = \left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)^a$$</p>

<p>Where $L$ and $M$ are the star's luminosity and mass, and $L_\odot$ and $M_\odot$ and the luminosity and mass of the Sun. For stars with $M &lt; 0.43M_\odot$, $a$ takes the value of 2.3. Now we can plug in Jupiter's mass ($1.8986 \times 10 ^{27}$ kg) into the formula, as well as the Sun's mass ($1.98855 \times 10 ^ {30}$ kg) and luminosity ($3.846 \times 10 ^ {26}$ watts), and we get </p>

<p>$$\frac{L}{3.846 \times 10 ^ {26}} = \left(\frac{1.8986 \times 10 ^ {27}}{1.98855 \times 10 ^ {30}}\right)^{2.3}$$</p>

<p>This becomes $$L = \left(\frac{1.8986 \times 10 ^ {27}}{1.98855 \times 10 ^ {30}}\right)^{2.3} \times 3.846 \times 10 ^ {26}$$</p>

<p>which then becomes</p>

<p>$$L = 4.35 \times 10 ^ {19}$$ watts.</p>

<p>Now we can work out the apparent brightness of Lucifer, as seen from Earth. For that, we need the formula</p>

<p>$$m = m_\odot - 2.5 \log \left(\frac {L}{L_\odot}\left(\frac {d_\odot}{d}\right) ^ 2\right)$$</p>

<p>where $m$ is the apparent magnitude of the star, $m_\odot$ is the apparent magnitude of the Sun, $d_\odot$ is the distance to the Sun, and $d$ is the distance to the star. Now, $m = -26.73$ and $d(s)$ is 1 (in astronomical units). $d$ varies. Jupiter is about 5.2 AU from the Sun, so at its closest distance to Earth, it would be ~4.2 AU away. We plug these numbers into the formula, and find</p>

<p>$$m = -6.25$$</p>

<p>which is a lot less brighter than the Sun. Now, when Jupiter is farthest away from the Sun, it is ~6.2 AU away. We plug <em>that</em> into the formula, and find</p>

<p>$$m = -5.40$$</p>

<p>which is dimmer still - although, of course, Jupiter would be completely blocked by the Sun. Still, for finding the apparent magnitude of Jupiter at some distance from Earth, we can change the above formula to </p>

<p>$$m = -26.73 - 2.5 \log \left(\frac {4.35 \times 10 ^ {19}}{3.846 \times 10 6 {26}}\left(\frac {1}{d}\right) ^ 2\right)$$</p>

<p>By comparison, the Moon can have an average apparent magnitude of -12.74 at full moon - much brighter than Lucifer. The apparent magnitude of both bodies can, of course, change - Jupiter by transits of its moon, for example - but these are the optimal values.</p>

<p>While the above calculations really don't answer most parts of your question, I hope it helps a bit. And please, correct me if I made a mistake somewhere. LaTeX is by no means my native language, and I could have gotten something wrong.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>The combined brightness of Lucifer and the Sun would depend on the angle of the Sun's rays and Lucifer's rays. Remember how we have different seasons because of the tilt of the Earth's axis? Well, the added heat would have to do with the tilt of Earth's and Lucifer's axes relative to one another. I can't give you a numerical result, but I can add that I hope it wouldn't be too much hotter than it is now, as I'm writing this!</p>

<p><strong>Second Edit</strong></p>

<p>Like I said in a comment somewhere on this page, the mass-luminosity relation really only works for main-sequence stars. If Lucifer was not on the main sequence. . . Well, then none of my calculations would be right.</p>

<p>Yes it does. </p>

<p>It does. When we look at the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation we see a ""dipole anisotropy"" due to the motion of the Earth relative to it:</p>

"A good telescope for the viewing of Nebulae, Stars and Planets","12298","","<p>So, I am a 15 year old interested in astronomy. My father used to have a reflector telescope, but was never so serious about it that he could recommend me a good telescope. I am looking to buy a telescope up to £400 (possibly £500) and would like one that is mainly great for looking at nebulae. Stars and Planets would be great also, but are not necessary. Light Pollution isn't too bad. I have been recommended a Newtonian Reflector, but am not too sure if this would be suitable for my conditions. Also, does anyone recommend a good, British website where I could buy such a scope from? Finally, is there much point in me buying a computerized scope, will this allow me to align the scope better, or is it just going to be a waste of money.</p>
","<p>This is a very common question, yet very hard to answer if you prefer a clear, concise, uncontroversial answer that applies to all situations. So I'm not going to do that.</p>

<p>Instead, I'm going to describe your main options, and let you choose. Be aware that you'll make the choice while still not knowing much about optics. So, in a sense, it will be just the beginning of a learning journey, and you'll have to keep learning and trying things out. Hope you like that sort of thing, because it's kind of mandatory in this hobby.</p>

<p>Also, there are two kinds of people in this field: those who enjoy <em>using</em> the instruments, and those who enjoy <em>making</em> the instruments. I'm 25% of the former, 75% of the latter kind (I make telescopes and mirrors, and I do some optics design). So that's the perspective you'll get.</p>

<hr>

<p>First off, a few words about the objects you'll observe. There are two kinds of objects:</p>

<p><strong>HIGH RESOLUTION, HIGH BRIGHTNESS</strong></p>

<p>These are the planets, the Moon, many double stars, and the like. These are typically pretty bright, so the amount of light you capture is not essential. But these objects show high-resolution detail, so the resolving power of your scope is crucial.</p>

<p>You get more resolving power if the aperture (the diameter) of the scope is bigger. But there's a problem - seeing (the inverse of turbulence).</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing</a></p>

<p>When air is turbulent, it will reduce the resolving power of your instrument. If your scope is 200 mm (8"") or bigger, this will happen A LOT. If your instrument is 100 mm (4"") or smaller, it's not so noticeable because you don't have that much resolving power to begin with.</p>

<p>There are ways to forecast seeing, because it depends on weather:</p>

<p><a href=""http://cleardarksky.com/csk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://cleardarksky.com/csk/</a></p>

<p>So, for high resolution targets, the point of having a large instrument (like a huge dobsonian) is because once in a while seeing is so good (turbulence is so low) that you can actually use all its huge power - but most of the time you'll be using it at much less than its theoretical power, as if it's a 4"" instrument or whatever the seeing is at the moment.</p>

<p>These objects are not affected by light pollution. You could observe the Moon from a brightly illumined parking lot in the middle of the city. You don't need to be in deep darkness while observing them - in fact, it's beneficial if you're not adapted to very deep darkness.</p>

<p><strong>LOW BRIGHTNESS</strong></p>

<p>These are most of the nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies. These are distant, faint objects. Their light is very faint, so it's essential you capture as much of it as possible. Again, bigger aperture is better.</p>

<p>These are the kind of objects that huge dobsonians (half-meter aperture, or more) are made for. In a very large scope, there's galaxies everywhere.</p>

<p>But again, there's a catch. These objects are affected by light pollution.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/</a></p>

<p>You need to take your scope far and away from any city, town and industrial complex (at least a 1 hour trip at highway speed). This is pretty hard to do in Europe; in the US, population density is low and this is somewhat easier. Anyway, just stay away from city lights and the view will improve.</p>

<p>A few of these objects will be visible from the city: the Andromeda galaxy, the M13 cluster, the Orion nebula, etc. But many of them look much, much better away from light polution. In any case, you should be able to observe the whole Messier catalogue (over 100 objects) from the city - but out in the boondocks these things look better.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Messier_objects"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Messier_objects</a></p>

<p>It's important that your eyes are adapted to very deep darkness when observing these things, so stay away from any source of light. Even the screen of your phone is far too bright. Street lights 500 meters away are too bright. And turn off that flashlight and keep it off. One second of exposure to a bright light destroys a dark adaptation that took 20 minutes to build.</p>

<p>Since these objects are so faint, the eye doesn't see a whole lot of high-resolution detail, so they are not affected by seeing (as far as the human eye is concerned).</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, now here are the main types of instruments that you're most likely to encounter:</p>

<p><strong>NEWTONIAN REFLECTORS IN GENERAL (DOBSONIANS IN PARTICULAR)</strong></p>

<p>Many people will say ""just get an 8 inch dob as your first scope"", and that's usually correct. This design gives the biggest aperture per price. Biggest bang for the buck. It scales up easily to very, very large sizes. It's the ideal instrument for observing the ""faint fuzzies"" (nebulae, galaxies). It's great for learning, because you can easily observe its guts. When seeing is good, a large dob will open up the sky for you - you can crank up the magnification a lot (depending on aperture).</p>

<p>On the flip side, due to the low price, you will see many dobs out there that are shoddily made.</p>

<p>You need to remember two things with a dob: collimation, and thermal management.</p>

<p><strong>Collimation</strong> means keeping all the optics aligned. The mirrors will move a little, due to the way a dob is built, and they'll lose collimation. So don't forget to re-adjust it once in a while. In time, you'll get so good at it, you'll give it a two-minute quick adjustment every time you observe, and it'll be good to go; that's what I do.</p>

<p>This is why collimation is important:</p>

<p><a href=""http://legault.perso.sfr.fr/collim.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://legault.perso.sfr.fr/collim.html</a></p>

<p>This is a good introduction to newtonian collimation (which is a vast topic, you could write a whole book on it):</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cloudynights.com/documents/primer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.cloudynights.com/documents/primer.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>Thermal management</strong> means keeping the scope at the same temperature as the ambient air. If you don't do this, internal convection will destroy the image. This is why:</p>

<p><a href=""http://garyseronik.com/beat-the-heat-conquering-newtonian-reflector-thermals-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://garyseronik.com/beat-the-heat-conquering-newtonian-reflector-thermals-part-1/</a></p>

<p>Small dobs (up to 6...8""), just take it outside at least 1 hour before you observe - or better yet, 2 hours. Let it ""breathe"". Dobs 10"" or larger, you MUST use a fan on the primary mirror to force cooling.</p>

<p><strong>REFRACTORS</strong></p>

<p>These instruments are very convenient and very low maintenance. Take it out of the box, and it's good to go. It's collimated from factory, and it doesn't care about thermal issues. A refractor makes a great ""travelscope"", and a great grab-and-go scope.</p>

<p>On the flip side, they are the most expensive, in terms of how much aperture you get for the money you spend. And they are typically made in small apertures; most commercial refractors are not bigger than 6"" or so; those that are bigger are extremely expensive. The small aperture limits the maximum performance of these instruments.</p>

<p>There is this myth out there that refractors are somehow magically better for planets (and other high-resolution targets), whereas dobs, even very large ones, are not so great. This is false; load up the designs in Zemax, do a basic performance analysis, and you'll see that aperture is the dominant factor, with everything else being secondary. But there are several reasons why this myth is around, and it's instructive to see what these reasons are:</p>

<ul>
<li>refractors perform at 100% of their potential no matter what, right out of the box. Dobs require maintenance and fiddling to perform at 100%.</li>
<li>many dob owners simply don't do the required maintenance - they don't collimate their scope, and don't give it time to reach thermal equilibrium. Then of course it will perform miserably on planets. There are 12"" dobs out there that perform worse than 4"" refractors because of how out of collimation they are and how hot the mirror is.</li>
<li>many refractors out there are quite well made (they ought to be, given the higher price you're paying), whereas many dobs are cheaply made in a sweatshop. So you're not comparing apples to apples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line: don't buy a refractor because you ""want to watch planets"". But do buy a refractor if simplicity of use and the low maintenance are very important to you (and you don't care much about price).</p>

<p>A decent refractor on an excellent mount can do pretty good astrophotography. More on that below.</p>

<p><strong>CATADIOPTRICS (CASSEGRAIN, MAKSUTOV, DALL-KIRKHAM, RITCHIE-CHRETIEN)</strong></p>

<p>Broadly speaking, these are for astrophotography (not always, but usually). But can you do visual astronomy with them? Sure. It's just that it's easier to optimize them for photo, with this design.</p>

<p>Usually, they come installed on a motorized mount. All but the very cheapest ones have a computer on-board; you just punch the name of the object into the remote control, and the scope will turn around automatically to face the object. Sounds cool, right?</p>

<p>Well, I am going to say something a little controversial here: this is not a good place to start.</p>

<p>First off, astrophotography has an extremely steep learning curve. It's very easy to take a little blurry photo of Jupiter that will impress nobody. It's very hard to take a great, high resolution photo like these:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.acquerra.com.au/astro/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.acquerra.com.au/astro/</a></p>

<p>The skills and knowledge required to take that kind of photos are more easily acquired by doing purely visual astronomy, on a dob or whatever, for a couple years or more. Also, the equipment required for that sort of stunt costs many thousands of dollars - your cheap little Cassegrain cannot do it.</p>

<p>So why buy a small Cass? Well, if you have an overwhelming interest in astrophoto, and are prepared to deal with the difficult learning, then go ahead. But realize that the first images are not going to be very impressive, and the motorized mount will not teach you some valuable skills that you would acquire more easily pushing a dob around and keeping your eye plugged into the ocular for a while. Also, money spent on the motorized mount is money NOT spent on aperture, and the aperture is so important for overall performance.</p>

<p>For astrophotography, the mount is of huge importance; the scope per se is relatively less important (I'm generalizing). A so-so scope on a great mount is much better than the other way around. But a great GEM mount can be very expensive.</p>

<hr>

<p>Well, that's it. Do some more research on your own, then make a decision. Don't forget that learning only begins with the moment you acquire the scope.</p>

<p>Above all, have fun, and keep looking up.</p>

<p>Clear skies to you!</p>

"Why do sunspots appear dark?","12090","","<p>Sunspots, such as this one, appear dark:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VM9qym.jpg"" alt=""sunspot""></p>

<p>Why?</p>
","<p>Typical sunspots have a dark region (umbra) surrounded by a lighter region, the penumbra. While sunspots have a temperature of about 6300 °F (3482.2 °C), the surface of the sun which surrounds it has a temperature of 10,000 °F (5537.8 °C).</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/sunspot.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this NASA resource</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sunspots are actually regions of the solar surface where the magnetic field of the Sun becomes concentrated over 1000-fold. Scientists do not yet know how this happens. Magnetic fields produce pressure, and this pressure can cause gas inside the sunspot to be in balance with the gas outside the sunspot...but at a lower temperature. Sunspots are actually several thousand degrees cooler than the 5,770 K (5496.8 °C) surface of the Sun, and contain gases at temperature of 3000 to 4000 K (2726.9 - 3726.8 °C). They are dark only by contrast with the much hotter solar surface. <strong>If you were to put a sunspot in the night sky, it would glow brighter than the Full Moon with a crimson-orange color!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sunspots are areas of intense magentic activity, as is apparent in this image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/sunspot1.jpg"" alt=""sunspot""></p>

<p>You can see the material kind of getting stretched into strands. </p>

<p>As for the <em>reason</em> it is cooler than the rest of the surface:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the details of sunspot generation are still a matter of research, it appears that sunspots are the visible counterparts of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux_tube"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">magnetic flux tubes</a> in the Sun's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_zone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">convective zone</a> that get ""wound up"" by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_rotation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">differential rotation</a>. If the stress on the tubes reaches a certain limit, they curl up like a rubber band and puncture the Sun's surface. <strong>Convection is inhibited at the puncture points; the energy flux from the Sun's interior decreases; and with it surface temperature.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all, the sunspots appear dark because the are darker <em>than the surrounding surface</em>. They're darker because they are cooler, and they're cooler because of the intense magnetic fields in them.</p>

"Why can we sometimes see the moon during the day?","12075","","<p>At some points in the year, the moon at my location can be clearly visible during the day. Why is this?</p>

<p>If it is any help, I live in Alberta, Canada. </p>
","<p>The Moon makes a full orbit around the Earth once per month. From full moon to full moon, it is 29.53058886 days (synodic month).</p>

<p>Full moon happens when the Moon is at one side of the Earth (right side in the image), and the Sun is at the other side. This way, Moon is fully iluminated by Sun (except in the cases where it is exactly in the opposite side of the same line, where you have a Moon eclipse). In this phase, Moon is at its highest altitude at midnight.</p>

<p>Then, as the Moon orbits, it comes closer to the Sun in the sky. This means both that it shows us less iluminated percentage and that its rise and set get delayed. At Last Quarter, Moon is at its highest altitude at sunrise. This means that you will be able to see the half moon figure on the sky during the morning (and last half of the night).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bew2Q.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Then it comes New Moon, where the Moon is nearest to the Sun in the sky, and almost invisible, since it shows us the dark side during the day. Its highest altitude is at noon, but you will not be able to see it. You can, if you are lucky, see a Sun Eclipse.</p>

<p>Finally it comes First Quarter. To put it short, highest altitude is at sunset and you are able to see Moon during all the afternoon (and first half of the night).</p>

"Will Earth lose the Moon before the Sun goes into supernova?","11981","","<p>Ive read on some sites and saw on youtube videos that the moon is getting away from earth by 1-3 cm a year. </p>

<p>Is this enough to make the Earth lose the Moon before the Sun goes into Supernova?</p>

<p>Im asking because I would like to do the calculations for Earths magnetic pull on this subject. It appears to me that it should be a non-linear function (there are also other factors, like if the Moon could be captured by another planet or having asteroids messing with its orbit on Earth).</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>As HDE 226868 noted in his answer, the Sun is not going to go supernova. That's something only large stars experience at the end of their main sequence life. Our Sun is a dwarf star. It's not big enough to do that. It will instead expand to be a red giant when it burns out the hydrogen at the very core of the Sun. It will continue burning hydrogen as a red giant, but in a shell around a sphere of waste helium. The Sun will start burning helium when it reaches the tip of the red giant phase. At that point it will shrink a bit; a slight reprieve. It will expand to a red giant once again on the asymptotic red giant branch when it burns all the helium at the very core. It will then burn helium in a shell surrounding a sphere of waste carbon and oxygen. Larger stars proceed beyond helium burning. Our Sun is too small. Helium burning is where things stop.</p>

<p>The Sun has two chances as a red giant to consume the Earth. Some scientists say the Sun will consume the Earth, others that it won't. It's all a bit academic because the Earth will be dead long, long before the Sun turns into a red giant. I'll have more to say on this in the third part of my answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>The current lunar recession rate is 3.82 cm/year, which is outside your one to three centimeters per year window. This rate is anomalously high. In fact, it is extremely high considering that dynamics says that
$$\frac {da}{dt} = (\text{some boring constant})\frac k Q \frac 1 {a^{11/2}}$$
Here, $a$ is the semi major axis length of the Moon's orbit, $k$ is the Earth-Moon tidal Love number, and $Q$ is the tidal dissipation quality factor. Qualitatively, a higher Love number means higher tides, and a higher quality factor means less tidal friction.</p>

<p>That inverse $a^{5.5}$ factor indicates something seriously funky must be happening to make the tidal recession rate so very high right now, and this is exactly the case. There are two huge north-south barriers to the flow of the tides right now, the Americas in the western hemisphere and Afro-Eurasia in the eastern hemisphere. This alone increases $k/Q$ by a considerable amount. The oceans are also nicely shaped so as to cause some nice resonances that increase $k/Q$ even further.</p>

<p>If something even funkier happens and the Moon recedes at any average rate of four centimeters per year over the next billion years, the Moon will be at a distance of 425,000 km from the Earth (center to center). That's less than 1/3 of the Earth's Hill sphere. Nearly circular prograde orbits at 1/3 or less of the Hill sphere radius should be stable. Even with that over-the-top recession rate, the Moon will not escape in the next billion years.</p>

<hr>

<p>What about after a billion years? I chose a billion years because that's about when the Moon's recession should more or less come to a standstill. If the Earth hasn't already died before this billion year mark, this is when the Earth dies.</p>

<p>Dwarf stars such as our Sun get progressively more luminous throughout their life on the main sequence. The Sun will be about 10% more luminous than it is now a billion years into the future. That should be enough to trigger a moist greenhouse, which in turn will trigger a runaway greenhouse. The Earth will become Venus II. All of the Earth's oceans will evaporate. Water vapor will reach well up into what is now the stratosphere. Ultraviolet radiation will photodissociate that water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen will escape. Eventually the Earth will not only be bare of liquid water on the surface, it will be bare of water vapor in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Almost all of the Moon's recession is a consequence of ocean tides. Without oceans, that tunar recession will more or less come to a standstill.</p>

"Why do objects burn when they enter earth's atmosphere?","11472","","<p>Why do all objects burn when they enter our atmosphere? is this because of our atmosphere composition? and does this happen on other planets as well?</p>
","<p>You'll often hear that it's because of friction, but that's often not the main factor. For larger objects it's more likely the pressure they create. </p>

<p>In both cases the reason is the enormous speed, often tens of kilometers per second. When a larger object enters the atmosphere at these speed the air in front of it gets compressed so much that it becomes extremely hot. (Think of pumping up a tire; you're also compressing air and you can feel the valve becoming hot.) The compressed air will often disintegrate the object in the air, and then the debris may burn because of the heat. This is exactly what happened to the asteroid above Russia last year: it exploded with an enormous flash in the air, and left little traces on the ground.</p>

<p>This happens on other planets as well, if they have a sufficiently dense atmosphere. In 1994 the comet Shoemaker-Levy crashed into Jupiter. It disintegrated before entering Jupiter's atmosphere due to the strong gravitation, but when the fragments entered the atmosphere they could easily be seen lighting up as they burned up.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong><br>
Remember the Space Shuttle? It had heat resistant tiles on the bottom of the craft to protect it from burning when it entered the atmosphere, even though its speed is only a fraction of a meteorite's speed when that enters the atmosphere.<br>
During the last launch of the Space Shuttle Columbia some material from the external fuel tank damaged this heat shield, and upon re-entry the heat and the highly pressurized air under the craft could enter it, causing the craft to disintegrate and kill all crew.</p>

"How would Earth's climate differ if it's axis were tilted around 90 degrees like Uranus?","11358","","<p>As the title states, what would the effect on Earth's climate be if it's axis were tilted approximately 90 degrees like Uranus?  </p>

<p>I'm specifically wondering about the effects on seasons, temperature, and life on Earth.  However, I'm happy to hear about other effects as well.</p>
","<p>This is a good question, and has been somewhat a topic of study by a few.  So below is some consequences of if Earth had a tilt like that of Uranus (for this explanation, I am disregarding the wobbles in the Earth's current axis, just focussing on the 90 degree axis):</p>

<p>According to the article <a href=""http://www.spacedaily.com/news/extrasolar-99m.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Not All Habitable Zones Are Created Equal</a> (Moomaw, 1999), each day and night would be 6 months each (including an epically long dusk and dawn), with daytime temperatures reaching up to 80C, but the night time side may not reach freezing - owing to the time to take to cool down from the 6 month day.  Parts of the equatorial regions would be, however, permanently encased in ice.</p>

<p>Pretty much like this diagram of Uranus' rotation (from <a href=""http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/ast110_06/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source: University of Hawaii</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zCF1H.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A major consequence of this according to the author is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In such an environment, life could almost certainly still appear, but it would have much more difficulty evolving into forms that could survive such grotesque temperature extremes -- which would greatly slow down its evolution into more complex forms, maybe by billions of years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A great consequence of this, particularly the 6 month night is that photosynthesis would have been stilted, if it could have started at all.  This has a great consequence on oxygen levels of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the authors claim that if the Earth had an axial tilt of 90 degrees, but at 210 million km from the sun, then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>its climate would be positively balmy -- the equator would be 11 deg C (52 deg F), and the poles would never rise above 46 deg C (115 deg F) or fall below 3 deg C (37 deg F). Earth would have no ice anywhere on its surface, except on some of its highest mountains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the article <a href=""http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/4543/high-planetary-tilt-lowers-odds-for-life"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">High Planetary Tilt Lowers Odds for Life?</a> (Hadhazy, 2012), has a great way of putting it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Your northern pole will be boiled during part of the year while the equator gets little sunlight,"" said Heller. Meanwhile, ""the southern pole freezes in total darkness."" Essentially, the conventional notion of a scorching hell dominates one side of the planet, while an ultra-cold hell like that of Dante's Ninth Circle prevails on the other. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, to make matters worse, the hells reverse half a year later. ""The hemispheres are cyclically sterilized, either by too strong irradiation or by freezing,"" Heller said. </p>

<p>They also describe that if life were to evolve, extremophiles (specifically, thermophiles) would be dominant - seasonally.</p>

Using the calculator on <a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=840&amp;month=5&amp;year=2014&amp;obj=moon&amp;afl=-11&amp;day=1"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> it can be seen that if one were looking at the sky on May 1st, 2014 from Irvine, California the moon set at 10:08PM (which at 8PM would have had the moon most of the way across the sky as noted in the question.)</p>

<p>The moon rises and sets approximately one hour later each day.  So, by May 14th the moon did not even <strong>rise</strong> until nearly 8PM - which also correlates with the observations noted above.</p>

<p>Contrasting that with the other context point made in the OP, using <a href=""http://www.almanac.com/astronomy/rise/CA/Irvine/2014-05-14"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> we can see that on May 1st Saturn rose at 8:07PM and on May 14th rose at 7:11PM.</p>

<p>So while the moon changes its rise a set times by almost an hour <strong>each day</strong>, the planets change much more slowly by comparison, almost an hour over <strong>two weeks</strong>.</p>

<p>If one weren't continually watching the moon's progression it would appear to abruptly change positions when comparing it to the planets' movements.</p>

"What will happen when landing on Jupiter?","10875","","<p>Jupiter is a gas giant, so landing on it will not be like as on Earth, our moon or Mars etc., as it <strong>does not</strong> have a <em>solid</em> surface like these.</p>

<p>If we have a hypothetical spaceship or probe landing on Jupiter, which can withstand the enormous pressure, what or how will be the sequence of events?</p>

<p>I already read <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Jupiter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A major problem in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet
  has no solid surface on which to land, as there is a smooth transition
  between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes
  descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense
  pressures within Jupiter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I do not understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>This enormous or immense pressure is of atmosphere or Jupiter's <em>surface</em>?</li>
<li>While descending, will we know that now we have transitioned from the atmosphere into the <em>surface</em>?</li>
<li>Why does animated footage (real or conceptual) Jupiter appear like a high viscous liquid (e.g. lava) rotating in opposite direction, rather that gas(es)?</li>
<li>Does Jupiter has an inner solid core?</li>

","<p>Jupiter does not have a ""surface"" and nor is there anything but an arbitrary division between interplanetary space and where its atmosphere begins.</p>

<p>The crushing pressure is its atmospheric pressure. The deeper into the atmosphere you go, the greater the column of gas that lies above you. It is the weight of this column of gas that is responsible for the rapid increase in pressure with depth.</p>

<p>The answer to your last question is most definitely addressed in the duplicate question about whether Jupiter is entirely made of gas. There is quite likely to be a liquid phase nearer the centre and there may be a solid core of order ten times the mass of the Earth. It is not a settled question.</p>

<p>The gas motions you talk about are essentially belts of weather systems in the upper layers of Jupiter's atmosphere. It is all most definitely gas that you can see.</p>

"Why does Jupiter have so many moons?","10465","","<p>Jupiter has a great many moons - in the hundreds, and they're still being discovered.</p>

<p>What is the current theory for where all these moons came from? Are they rocks flying through space captured by Jupiter's gravity?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dlQHH.jpg"" alt=""Jupiters moons""></p>
","<p>Mass.</p>

<p>The more massive a body, the larger the gap between its lowest and highest orbit; the range of speeds at which a random body entering its gravity is likely to remain as its satellite. Sun has millions of satellites if you count all the asteroids; smaller planets tend to have one or two moons at most (Pluto with five being a notable and not fully explained exception)</p>

<p>To a lesser degree there's a matter of shape too. A regularly round body will have more regular and stable orbit than a potato-shaped one. Jupiter, being a gas giant is perfectly round. This doesn't play that much of a role though, especially with higher orbits.</p>

<p>And last but not least, no destabilizing influence of other bodies. It's very hard to maintain a lunar orbit - artificial satellites around our Moon last only a couple years each, because relatively close neighborhood of Earth tends to destabilize orbit of anything orbiting the Moon. Jupiter being a single massive planet with relatively tiny (relatively to its mass) moons doesn't have them influence each other all that much. </p>

"Why is the discovery of merging neutron stars important?","10031","","<p>I'm fairly certain people here will have heard about it, already, but apparently, two supernova leftovers clashed some 130 million years ago and some billion billion kilometres away ...</p>

<p>What I <em>haven't</em> heard yet, however, is <em>why</em> we should care.</p>

<p>I mean sure, it's an interesting phenomenon and measuring it can't have been easy.</p>

<p>But now that we've heard it ... what changes?</p>

<p>I'll admit it, I don't know particularly much about astronomy, but I'm curious:</p>

<p>What's the significance of having achieved this? Why does it matter whether or not we know?</p>
","<p>Reasons why this is important:</p>

<p>It is the <em>first</em> simultaneous detection of a gravitational wave and electromagnetic signal, and the strongest GW signal yet in terms of signal to noise (<a href=""http://www.google.com/calendar/render"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abbott et al. 2017a</a>). It spectacularly corroborates the reality of the GW detection technology and analysis. The progenitor has been unambiguously located in a (relatively) nearby galaxy (<a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa9059/meta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Soares-Santos et al. 2017</a>), allowing a host of other telescopes to obtain detailed measurements.</p>

<p>It shows that GWs travel at the speed of light, a further verification of Einstein's General Relativity (<a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa920c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abbott et al. 2017b</a>).</p>

<p>It shows that most of the very heavy elements such as gold, platinum, osmium etc. are plausibly produced by merging neutron stars and constrains the rate of such mergers in the local universe (e.g. <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa905c/meta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chornock et al. 2017</a>; <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa90b6/meta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tanvir et al. 2017</a>).</p>

<p>It shows that short gamma ray bursts — some of the most energetic explosions in the universe — can be caused by neutron star mergers (e.g. <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa8f94/meta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Savchenko et al. 2017</a>; <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/?hl=en&amp;shva=1#inbox"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Goldstein et al. 2017</a>).</p>

<p>It is the closest detected short gamma ray burst (with a known distance). That the progenitor has also been characterised allows a closer investigation of the interesting physics underlying the ejection and jet mechanisms thought to be responsible for the gamma rays and later X-ray and radio emission (e.g. <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa9057/meta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Margutti et al. 2017</a>; <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa905d/meta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Alexander et al. 2017</a>).</p>

<p>It provides observational constraints on how matter behaves at extremely high densities, testing our understanding of fundamental physics to its limits — for example, the details of the gravitational wave signal moments before merger are diagnostic of the interior conditions of neutron stars at densities of $\sim 10^{18}$ kg/m$^3$ (<a href=""https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.81.123016"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hinderer et al. 2010</a>; <a href=""https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.82.024016"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Postnikov et al. 2010</a>).</p>

<p>It provides an independent way of measuring the expansion of the universe. Merging binary gravitational wave sources are known as ""standard sirens"", because the distance to the GW source pops straight out of the analysis and can be compared with the redshift of the identified host galaxy (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaap/ncurrent/full/nature24471.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abbott et al. 2017c</a>). The result agrees with measurements made using the cosmic microwave background and the distance-redshift relation calibrated by other means, verifying our estimation of distances, at least in the local universe.</p>

<p>Finally, this event will turn out to be important because it was <em>lucky</em>; in the sense that the source was detected well-inside the sensitivity horizon of LIGO (<a href=""https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abbott et al. 2017a</a>). The detection itself, was not unexpected given the rates predicted based on studying the neutron star binary systems in our own Galaxy (e.g. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4676"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kim et al. 2015</a>), but the fact that it was so close —
 within the closest 5% of the sensitive survey volume where it could have been detected — is fortunate.</p>

<p>In the end, if someone thinks none of the above is interesting or important, then nothing I can write will convince them otherwise. The vast majority of people I speak to are curious and fascinated to find out about our cosmic origins and how the universe works.</p>

"How loud would the Sun be?","10003","","<p>Sound can't travel through outer space. But if it could, how loud would the Sun be? Would the sound be dangerous to life on Earth, or would we barely hear it from this distance?</p>
","<p>The Sun is immensely loud. The surface generates thousands to tens of thousands of watts of sound power for every square meter. That's something like 10x to 100x the power flux through the speakers at a rock concert, or out the front of a police siren. Except the ""speaker surface"" in this case is the entire surface of the Sun, some 10,000 times larger than the surface area of Earth.</p>

<p>Despite what ""user10094"" said, we do in fact know what the Sun ""sounds"" like -- instruments like SDO's HMI or SOHO's MDI or the ground-based GONG observatory measure the Doppler shift everywhere on the visible surface of the Sun, and we can actually see sound waves (well, infrasound waves) resonating in the Sun as a whole! Pretty cool, eh? Since the Sun is large, the sound waves resonate at very deep frequencies -- typical resonant modes have 5 minute periods, and there are about a million of them going all at once.</p>

<p>The resonant modes in the Sun are excited by something. That something is the tremendous broadband rushing of convective turbulence. Heat gets brought to the surface of the Sun by convection -- hot material rises through the outer layers, reaches the surface, cools off (by radiating sunlight), and sinks. The ""typical"" convection cell is about the size of Texas, and is called a ""granule"" because they look like little grains when viewed through a telescope. Each one (the size of Texas, remember) rises, disperses its light, and sinks in five minutes. That produces a heck of a racket. There are something like 10 million of those all over the surface of the Sun at any one time. Most of that sound energy just gets reflected right back down into the Sun, but some of it gets out into the solar chromosphere and corona. No one can be sure, yet, just how much of that sound energy gets out, but it's most likely between about 30 and about 300 watts per square meter of surface, on average. The uncertainty comes because the surface dynamics of the Sun are tricky. In the deep interior, we can pretend the solar magnetic field doesn't affect the physics much and use hydrodynamics, and in the exterior (corona) we can pretend the gas itself doesn't affect the physics much. At the boundary layers above the visible surface, neither approximation applies and the physics gets too tricky to be tractable (yet).</p>

<p>In terms of dBA, if all that leaked sound could somehow propagate to Earth, well let's see... Sunlight at Earth is attenuated about 10,000 times by distance (i.e. it's 10,000 times brighter at the surface of the Sun), so if 200 W/m2 of sound at the Sun could somehow propagate out to Earth it would yield a sound intensity of about 20 mW/m2. 0dB is about 1pW/m2 , so that's about 100dB. At Earth, some 150,000,000 kilometers from the sound source. Good thing sound doesn't travel through space, eh?</p>

<p>The good folks at the SOHO/MDI project created some sound files of resonant solar oscillations by speeding up the data from their instrument by 43,000 times. You can hear those here, at the <a href=""http://solar-center.stanford.edu/singing/#sing"">Solar Center website</a>. Someone else did the same thing with the SDO/HMI instrument, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWCJkG31h0c"">superposed the sounds on first-light videos from SDO</a>. Both of those sounds, which sound sort of like rubber bands twanging, are heavily filtered from the data -- a particular resonant spatial mode (shape of a resonant sound) is being extracted from the data, and so you hear mainly that particular resonant mode. The actual unfiltered sound is far more cacophonous, and to the ear would sound less like a resonant sound and more like noise.</p>

"Should I focus more on Aperture or Focal Length for a telescope?","9859","","<p>Let's assume there are three types of telescopes with the following specifications:</p>

<pre><code>    Telescope                  Aperture              Focal Length
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Example 1                     70 mm                    400 mm

    Example 3                     60 mm                    900 mm
</code></pre>

<p>As a beginner, should I look for a higher value in the aperture or the focal length?</p>
","<p>There is one rule that is generally true for all deep sky objects (nebulae, stars, galaxies,...): Aperture matters!</p>

<p>For solar system objects, aperture is not that important. </p>

<p>The second most important thing is: What size are the objects you want to look at: Small objects need long focal lengths and high magnifications, large objects need short aperture for low magnifications.</p>

<p>With 400mm you could watch objects like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Andromeda galaxy core</li>
<li>Orion nebula, other large emission or reflective nebulae (e.g. Pleiades)</li>
<li>large star clusters</li>
<li>low magnification lunar observations</li>
</ul>

<p>With 900mm you could watch objects like</p>

<ul>
<li>Planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, ...)</li>
<li>high magnification lunar observations</li>
<li>planetary nebulae (e.g. ring nebula)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that 60 and 70mm aperture are still very small for telescopes! The aperture influences two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Light sensitvity: The larger the aperture, the more light you can collect. Very important if you live in a city!</li>
<li>Maximum resolution: Rule of thumb is that you can do aperture in mm times two as maximum magnification. I.e. for 60mm a 120x magnification is the absolute maximum which still is feasible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The magnification is created by the eyepiece. E.g. when you have a 400mm focal length telescope and use a 10mm eyepiece, you get 400mm/10mm = 40x magnification.</p>

<p>Note: the shorter the eyepiece focal length, the more difficult it is to build. Good 5mm eyepieces can cost 100 USD and up. I personally started with a 750mm Newtonian with 150mm aperture and 25mm and 10mm eyepieces. That's a good allrounder, even though planets will appear rather small with the 10mm eyepiece. But you can later invest more money in good eyepieces, which you can re-use on better telescopes which you may buy later on.</p>

<p>Edit: One more thing -- the telescope mount is equally important as are the eyepieces and the telescope itself. A mount that fits the telescope easily is as expensive as the optical tube assembly itself. Hence many beginners start out with a Dobson telescope, which uses a very, very simple yet sturdy mount.</p>

<p>How can I calculate the right ascension and declination?</p>
","<p>The answers to <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/9/could-someone-explain-ra-dec-in-simple-terms"">this question</a> are very clear and much better than I could have written.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by <code>""the stellar time at Greenwich at 0h UTC is 22h20min""</code>, but I'm assuming that you mean that that is the amount of time since the culmination of Aries over the Prime Meridian (Greenwich). That being the case, the Right Ascension (RA) of your body can be easily calculated. All we need to do is figure out what RA is passing your meridian at the time in question. This is probably a good time to point out that the longitude of Mt Teide is 16° 30'W not E.</p>

<p>We already know that RA 22H 20m is passing over Greenwich at the time of interest (or, at least that is what I am assuming as your explanation is not at all clear.), as we are to the West of Greenwich, then we know that any RA on our meridian is earlier and we can calculate how much earlier simply by dividing our longitude by 15 (as the earth spins at a nice steady 15°/hour):-</p>

<pre><code>diff in RA = Long/15 
           = 16° 30'/15 
           = 1H 06m
</code></pre>

<p>Then:-</p>

<pre><code>RA = RA at Greenwich - diff in RA 
   = 22H 20m - 1H 06m 
   = 21H 14m
</code></pre>

<p>Now for Declination:-</p>

<p>The first stage is to take a piece of ruled or graph paper and near the middle mark a short, horizontal line. This is your horizon, and is marked 'H'. Now draw upwards 9 lines and mark the top ,'Z' and downwards 9 lines and mark the bottom 'N'. You should end up with something that looks like this:-</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DtOhK.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Which is, basically a picture of your meridian as you sit and gaze south at it. 'Z' is your zenith, the point above you in the sky and 'N' is the nadir, it's opposite out on the celestial sphere through the earth beneath your feet.</p>

<p>Now we need to add a little more detail. Imagine that the celestial sphere is actually a glass sphere surrounding the earth with the stars and stuff stuck to it that we can project anything we want on to (we'll ignore porn and coke adverts for now), where would the celestial equator show and where would it go on our picture of the meridian? Well, it would be a distance above the horizon equal to our latitude (lets round it off to 30°), so we now have:-</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6A532.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now we put in the body we are looking at. We know it's elevation, just over 43°, we can just call it x as you didn't specify a body. We can also label some of the distances we know, to end up with:-</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TMkp7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>We already knew that Lat was H -> Q, that's how we place Q, we know that elevation, or altitude is between the horizon and the body and that declination is measured from the celestial equator. We want to find dec and the diagram shows us that:-</p>

<pre><code>dec = Alt - Lat 
    = 43° 40' - 28° 18' 
    = 15° 18'N
</code></pre>

<p>As 'x' is to the north of 'Q', then Declination is north.</p>

"What is the angular diameter of Earth as seen from the Moon?","9397","","<p>...today I must have left my brain home. I know it's a simple calculation but I keep failing simplest calculations today.</p>

<p>What is the angular diameter of Earth as seen from the surface of the Moon?</p>
","<p>You can calculate the angular diameter of the Earth using the equation:
$$a = \arctan \frac{D}{d}$$
where $a$ is the angular diameter, $D$ is the physical diameter of the Earth, and $d$ is the distance from the Moon to the Earth. </p>

<p>The equatorial radius of the Earth is $r_E = 6378.1 \textrm{km}$, the diameter is therefore $D= 2 \times r_E = 12756.2$.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"" rel=""nofollow"">mean distance to the Moon is $d=384399\textrm{km}$</a>. This gives a (mean) angular diameter of $a=1.90065$°.</li>
<li>At <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"" rel=""nofollow"">Perigee the distance is $d=362600\textrm{km}$</a>. This gives an angular diameter of $a=2.01482$°</li>
<li>At <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"" rel=""nofollow"">Apogee the distance is $d=405400\textrm{km}$</a>. This gives an angular diameter of $a=1.80226$°</li>
</ul>

<p>These Moon-Earth distances are as seen from the <strong>centre</strong> of the Moon. To calculate the diameter from the surface of the Moon, you'll have to subtract the position of the observer along the Moon-Earth axis.</p>

<p>If the observer is on the Moon's equator and the Earth is at zero hour angle (i.e. on the local meridian), the distance to the Earth needs to be subtracted by $r_M=1738.14\textrm{km}$. This gives the following values: </p>

<ul>
<li>The mean distance to the Moon is $d=384399-1738 = 382661\textrm{km}$. This gives a (mean) angular diameter of $a=1.90928$°.</li>
<li>At <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"" rel=""nofollow"">Perigee the distance is $d=362600-1738 = 360862\textrm{km}$</a>. This gives an angular diameter of $a=2.02452$°</li>
<li>At <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"" rel=""nofollow"">Apogee the distance is $d=405400-1738 = 403662\textrm{km}$</a>. This gives an angular diameter of $a=1.81001$°</li>
</ul>

<p>The angular diameter of the Earth from the <strong>surface</strong> of the Moon is, therefore, between $a=1.80226$° (at apogee and the Earth is near the horizon) and $a=2.02452$° (at perigee and for an observer at the equator and when the Earth is at maximum altitude on the meridian).</p>

"Is the moon moving further away from Earth and closer to the Sun? Why?","9388","","<p>According to <a href=""http://lro.gsfc.nasa.gov/moonfacts.html"">The NASA Moon Facts</a> page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The moon is actually moving away from earth at a rate of 1.5 inches per year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is the moon moving further away from the Earth? Is this a result of the moons formation that set it in motion to spiral away from us? Or is this a resultant force of the gravity from the Sun and other large bodies?</p>
","<p>Yes, the moon is moving away from Earth at around 1.48"" per year. According to <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12311119"" rel=""noreferrer"">the BBC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Moon is kept in orbit by the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on it, but the Moon also exerts a gravitational force on our planet and this causes the movement of the Earth's oceans to form a tidal bulge.</p>
  
  <p>Due to the rotation of the Earth, this tidal bulge actually sits slightly ahead of the Moon. Some of the energy of the spinning Earth gets transferred to the tidal bulge via friction.</p>
  
  <p>This drives the bulge forward, keeping it ahead of the Moon. The tidal bulge feeds a small amount of energy into the Moon, pushing it into a higher orbit like the faster, outside lanes of a test track.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, tidal forces are ultimately what causes this to happen.</p>

<p>Also, there is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on tidal forces</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tidal acceleration is an effect of the tidal forces between an orbiting natural satellite (e.g. the Moon), and the primary planet that it orbits (e.g. the Earth). The acceleration causes a gradual recession of a satellite in a prograde orbit away from the primary, and a corresponding slowdown of the primary's rotation. The process eventually leads to tidal locking of first the smaller, and later the larger body. The Earth–Moon system is the best studied case.</p>

<p>Bishop, if you are asking when the 2 specific points in time match, it is true that they have a 'astronomical' infrequency to look at. But if you look at what the common terms for the definition of a solstice and full moon occurring at the same time, then it is not too infrequent. Matching a 24 hour period (solstice day) against a 72 hour period (a full moon) then they occur with a much more reasonable frequency. There are lots of lunar cycle calculators around. The current cycle we are in has the same middle day of the full moon  period In 2004, 2007, 2015, 2026, 2034, 2042 and 2045. further dates can be found using this <a href=""http://aa.usno.navy.mil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aa.usno.navy.mil</a>.
Just chose any date, calculate the drift on your 400 year cycle then calculate how often that drift occurs at the same time as the 3 day phase of the full moon drift. There will be large periods when the match occurs rarely (The center point of each phase occurring furthest apart). As the centre points close on each other the Frequency will increase.

</ol>

<p>I can also buy lenses of range of Power(In Dioptres) from (-14D) - (+14D) of aperture range of 5.5 cm to 7 cm, if suggested.</p>

<p>Any way to get such a lens, or make an eyepiece barrell sort of, using a combination of lenses mentioned above or buying. And how to use it?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>I generally agree with the answer above, but have a couple more insights which might help you if you decide to proceed with trying to make your own scope...
The lens pairs that James mentioned (crown and flint) are known as a doublet.  Glass has two key properties in play here - its index of refraction (how much it bends light) and its dispersion (how much that bending changes over color).  The lens pair balances a strongly convex crown (low index and low dispersion) with a weakly concave flint (high index and high dispersion).  The dispersions are designed to cancel out, while you want the curvature of the convex crown to overpower the concave flint in terms of index, so it still has some ability to focus.  The design also inherently lends itself toward long focal lengths which are desirable in telescope objectives.<br>
Eyepieces, due to their short-desirable focal lengths necessitate more lenses which allow you to balance the chromatic aberration, and also address other optical aberrations which come into play with such a short focal length (distortion, astigmatism, coma, and spherical aberration being the main concerns).  There are well-established design forms which are often used for making well-corrected eyepieces, some of which can be found right on wikipedia: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyepiece#Eyepiece_designs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyepiece#Eyepiece_designs</a></p>

<p>One thing to consider, which I don't think has been mentioned is selection of focal lengths and apertures.  A 5cm aperture is plenty sufficient to view the Galilean moons, and probably some bright DSOs if you're well-corrected, and if your focal lengths are well-chosen.  The system magnification is the ratio of focal lengths between the objective lens and eyelens/eyepiece. (200cm/2.2cm = 90.9x).  This means that something like the Galilean moons, which have a max extent of about 1/8 degree, would be magnified to have an apparent extent of 11 degrees (much easier to resolve).
Your aperture selection (particularly of your objective) will determine the light-gathering ability.  But the magnification applies here too, so if you have a 5cm objective at 91x, your ""exit pupil"" will only be 0.55mm diameter, which is tiny compared to your eye's aperture.  You'd still be able to see the object, but your eyes will easily accommodate up to a 30cm objective aperture (3mm exit pupil).  Keep in mind, there is a tradeoff between aperture and aberrations, so unless you're designing a very well-aligned 2- or 3-element objective, you may want to stick with a max objective aperture of 50-75mm.</p>

<p>In terms of alignment, don't just set the lenses a certain distance apart and expect to see an image.  You will need to allow for some adjustment, which is probably easier looking at a distant object during the day.  After you form an image, you may need to adjust the centration and tilt of the eyelens to form the sharpest image to optimize your alignment.  </p>

<p>All that said, a small aperture, high-end refractive (glass) telescope can perform better than a reflective telescope of the same aperture.  But as aperture increases, the cost of the materials and impact of aberrations makes refractive telescopes vastly inferior to reflective (mirror) telescopes.  Since the design for these only necessitates 1 powered mirror and an off-the-shelf eyepiece for $50 or less, the best bang for your buck will definitely be a reflective telescope.  Sorry if that's not what you're hoping to hear, but it's why most telescopes on the market today are reflective.</p>

"Can our Sun become a black hole","8346","","<p>Does every star become a black hole? Is there any probability that our sun can become a black hole? If yes then is it on its way to become a black hole? what is the current state of sun as per the black hole life cycle? What will be the effect on all the planetary objects in the solar system if the sun turns into a black hole.</p>

<p>Sorry for so many questions but i cannot miss them as these are some questions on my mind.</p>
","<h2>No, the sun won't ever become a black hole.</h2>

<p>The choice between the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution#Stellar_remnants"">three fates of stars</a> (white dwarf, neutron star, black hole) is entirely determined by the star's mass.  </p>

<p>A star on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence"">main sequence</a> (like most stars, including our sun) is constantly in a balance between the inward pressure of gravity and the outward pressure of the energy generated by the hydrogen fusion that makes it ""burn"".<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>  This balance stays relatively stable until the star runs out of whatever its current fuel is - at that point, it stops burning, which means there's no longer outward pressure, which means it starts collapsing.  Depending on how much mass there is, it might get hot enough as it collapses to start fusing helium together. (If it's <em>really</em> massive, it might continue on to burn carbon, neon, oxygen, silicon, and finally iron, which <em>can't</em> be usefully fused.) </p>

<p>Regardless of what its final fuel is, eventually the star will reach a point where the collapse from gravity is insufficient to start burning the next fuel in line.  This is when the star ""dies"".</p>

<h3>White dwarfs</h3>

<p>If the star's remains<sup><strong>2</strong></sup> mass less than 1.44 solar masses (the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit"">Chandrasekhar limit</a><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>), eventually gravity will collapse the star to the point where each atom is pushed right up against the next.  They can't collapse further, because the electrons can't overlap.  While white dwarfs <em>do</em> shed light, they do so because they are extremely hot and slowly cooling off, not because they're generating new energy.  Theoretically, a white dwarf will eventually dim until it becomes a black dwarf, although the universe isn't old enough for this to have happened yet.</p>

<h3>Neutron stars</h3>

<p>If the collapsing star is above the Chandraskhar limit, gravity is so strong that it can overcome the ""electrons can't overlap"" restriction.  At that point, all the electrons in the star will be pushed into combining with protons to form neutrons.  Eventually, the entire star will composed primarily of neutrons pushed right up next to each other.  The neutrons can't be pushed into occupying the same space, so the star eventually settles into being a single ball of pure neutrons.</p>

<h3>Black holes</h3>

<p>Black holes are the step beyond neutron stars, although they're worth discussing in a bit more detail.  Everything, in theory, has a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius"">Schwarzschild radius</a>.  That's the radius where a ball of that mass would be so dense that light can't escape.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius for Earth is about 9mm.  However, for all masses smaller than somewhere between 2-3 times the mass of the sun, it's impossible to squeeze the matter small enough to get it inside that radius.  Even a neutron star isn't massive enough.</p>

<p>But a star that becomes a black hole is.  We don't actually know what happens to a star once it's become a black hole - the edges of the ""hole"" itself is simply the Schwarzschild radius - the point light can't escape.  From outside, it doesn't matter whether the matter collapsed to the point that the neutrons started overlapping, whether it stopped just inside the radius, or whether it continued collapsing until it broke all known physical laws.  The edges are still the same, because they're just a cutoff based on the escape velocity.  </p>

<hr>

<p><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>  I'm ignoring the red giant phase here, since it's just a delay in the ""run out of fuel"" step.  Basically, the core is helium ""ash"", while the hydrogen fusion process takes place further and further out.  Once that runs out, you get a nova and the collapse continues.</p>

<p><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Likewise, I'm ignoring the mass that stars shed in their various nova phases.  All given masses are based on the remnants left behind.</p>

<p>That's of course too simple. But wouldn't it help alot if it were the case from the beginning that Venus had had Mars' mass, and Mars had had Venus' mass? Or do other factors dominate mass and distance from the Sun?</p>

<p>Would a Mars at 0.7 AU have been warmer and maybe have had a passing atmosphere created from melting volatiles during a longer era in its history?</p>
","<p>This is a very interesting question. Of course, as you noted, you have simplified things quite a bit; there are other factors besides temperature that affect habitability.</p>

<p>Regarding Venus, you probably know that Venus is extremely hot at its surface not just because it is closer to the Sun, but because it has a thick CO2 atmosphere and is warmed by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect"">greenhouse effect</a>. There are, in fact, two things about Venus that would prevent it from being habitable wherever you put it. One is the lack of a magnetosphere, which is necessary to prevent ionizing radiation (particularly from the solar wind) from reaching the planet's surface. The lack of a magnetosphere appears to be due to the lack of a geodynamo on Venus, which has to do with the structure of its core. Second, Venus appears to lack tectonic plates, which you may know are responsible for earthquakes here on Earth. Interestingly, tectonic plates play a major role in controlling the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere (see <a href=""http://rainbow.ldeo.columbia.edu/courses/v1001/6.html"">here</a> for details). Lacking tectonic plates, Venus is doomed to have a large CO2 atmosphere wherever you put it, which would not make it a nice place to live.</p>

<p>Mars, on the other hand, is a very different matter. It has both a magnetosphere (albeit it is very weak) and it likely has tectonic plates (although last I heard it is thought to only have two). One of the reasons that NASA has sent so many probes to Mars is that it was thought to be habitable at one point. It is thought that Mars's growth was stunted because of gravitation effects from Jupiter and Saturn. So, in another universe, Mars could have ended up very much like another Earth.</p>

"Why do the planets orbit in the same direction?","7699","","<p>Theoretically, planets would have an approximately equal chance of going one way in their orbit or another but in reality, this is not the case (at least in our solar system). <strong>Why is this?</strong> </p>
","<p>The same reason (almost) all of them rotate in the same direction: because of the <strong>conservation of angular momentum.</strong></p>

<p>Before a star and its planets exist, there’s just a cloud of disorganized gas and small molecules. The Solar System formed from such a cloud around 4.6 billion years ago. </p>

<p>On that scale, there is some small amount of rotation within the cloud. It could be caused by the gravity of nearby stellar objects, local differences in mass as the cloud churns, or even the impact of a distant supernova. The point is, all molecular clouds have at least a little rotation.</p>

<p>In a large system like a molecular cloud, each particle has some angular momentum, and it all adds together across a very wide area. That’s a lot of momentum, and it is conserved as the cloud continues to collapse under its own gravity. That angular momentum also flattens the cloud, which is the reason why the Solar System is near-planar.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3kRf.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3kRf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When the cloud finally collapses, it forms a star and shortly after planets. However, angular momentum is always conserved. That's why planets all follow the same orbit, and why almost all of them rotate in the same direction. There's nothing to turn them the other direction, so they will continue spinning in the same direction as the original gas cloud.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions, though. Whenever objects formed in such a way that sent them orbiting the opposite direction, they usually collided with objects going in the same direction as the original cloud. This destroyed any outlying objects or sent them in the same direction as the original cloud.</p>

<p>Still, two huge exceptions are planets Venus and Uranus. Uranus spins on an axis of almost 90-degrees (on its side). Venus meanwhile spins the opposite direction as Earth and the other planets.</p>

<p>In both cases there is strong evidence that these planets were struck by large objects at some point in the distant past. The impacts were large enough to overcome the angular momentum of the bodies, and give them a different spin. There are also a range of other theories; for example, some astronomers think that Venus may have been flipped upside-down. Point is, there were irregular events that happened to both of these planets.</p>

<li><p>Comets don't cross Earth's orbit really. Orbits are one-dimensional objects and their chance of crossing in 3D space is 0. Henceforth, I consider a comet at distance 1AU from the Sun.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What's the maximum speed of a returning comet at 1AU from the Sun?</strong> This can be easily worked out from the <em>orbial energy</em>
$$
E = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{GM_\odot}{r},\qquad\qquad(*)
$$
which is conserved along the orbit ($v$ and $r$ the Heliocentric speed and distance). For a returning comet, $E&lt;0$ and the speed cannot exceed the escape speed (which occurs for $E=0$)
$$
v_{\rm escape}^2 = 2\frac{GM_\odot}{r}.
$$
The speed of the Earth can be worked out from the <strong>Virial theorem</strong>, according to which the orbital averages of the kinetic and potential energies, $T=\frac{1}{2}v^2$ and $W=-GM_\odot/r$, satisfy
$
2\langle T\rangle + \langle W\rangle=0.
$
For a (near-)circular orbit (such as Earth's), $r$ is constant and we have
$
v^2_{\rm Earth} = GM_\odot/r.
$
Thus, at $r$=1AU
$$
v_{\rm escape} = \sqrt{2} v_{\rm Earth}
$$
as already pointed out by Peter Horvath. Non-returning comets have local speed exceeding the escape speed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can a comet near Earth have a speed similar to Earth's orbital speed?</strong>. Let's assume a comet with the same speed as Earth at $r$=1AU and work out the consequences. Such a comet must have the same orbital energy as the Earth and, since
$$
E = -\frac{GM_\odot}{2a}\qquad\qquad(**)
$$
with $a$ the orbital semimajor axis, must also have $a=1AU$ and the same orbital period as Earth, i.e. one year. Moreover, the comet's apohelion satisfies
$$
r_{\rm apo}\le 2a = 2{\rm AU}.
$$
<strong>Such comets don't exist</strong> AFAIK. Most returning comets have much longer periods than 1 year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What's the typical speed of a returning comet when at distance 1AU from the Sun?</strong> To work out this question, let's parameterise the comet's orbit by its period $P=2\pi\sqrt{a^3/GM_\odot}$. From this relation we immediately get
$$
\frac{a_{\rm comet}}{\rm AU} = \left(\frac{P_{\rm comet}}{\rm yr}\right)^{2/3}.
$$
From equations ($*$) and ($**$), we can then find
$$
v_{\rm comet}(r=1{\rm AU}) = \sqrt{2-\left(\frac{P_{\rm comet}}{\rm yr}\right)^{-2/3}}\,v_{\rm Earth}.
$$
In the limit of $P\to\infty$, this recovers our previous result $v_{\rm comet}\to v_{\rm escape}$. For typical period of $\sim$70yr, the speed of the comet is close to this number.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I shall coment that all this only relates to the magnitude of the orbital velocity (speed), but not to its direction. Comets are typically on highly eccentric orbits and, when at $r$=1AU, move in quite a <strong>different direction</strong> than Earth, even if their speed is only slightly larger. So the <strong>relative speed</strong> $|\boldsymbol{v}_{\rm comet}-\boldsymbol{v}_{\rm Earth}|$ of a comet with respect to Earth can be anyting between about 10 and 70 km/s.</p></li>

"Is the moon only 60 pixels?","7113","","<p>In doing research on vision, I have learned that ""20/20"" vision corresponds to a visual acuity of being able to resolve details 1 arcminute in size, that <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0420.2005.00516.x/pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">most people have around 20/15 vision</a>, and that due to the limits of physiology basically nobody has vision better than 20/10 vision. This is an upper limit of resolving details about 0.5 arcminutes in size.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia the moon is around <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter"" rel=""noreferrer"">30 arcminutes wide</a> when seen by the naked eye.</p>

<p>Put these together, and it seems to say that when looking at the moon with the naked eye nobody can see more details than would be visible in a 60×60 image of the moon<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VVppV.png"" alt=""Moon on black background, 60×60 pixels""><br>
and that the average person can't see any more details than in a 40×40 version<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JGAOU.png"" alt=""Moon on black background, 40×40 pixels""></p>

<p>Those seem so small on my monitor. Can that really be all the detail that I can see on the moon with the naked eye?</p>
","<p>It doesn't seem so far-fetched to me.  Sure, you might be off by a few pixels, due to differences between the human eye and a computer monitor, but the order of magnitude seems about right &mdash; the detail in your images, viewed closely, more or less matches what I see when I look at the full moon.</p>

<p>Of course, you could fairly easily test it yourself: go outside on a dark night, when the moon is full, and see if you can spot with your naked eye any details that are not visible (even under magnification) in the image scaled to match your eyesight.  I suspect you might be able to see <em>some</em> extra detail (especially near the terminator, if the moon is not perfectly full), but not very much.</p>

<hr>

<p>For a more objective test, we could try to look for early maps or sketches of the moon made by astronomers before the invention of the telescope, which should presumably represent the limit of what the naked human eye could resolve.  (You <em>needed</em> to have good eyesight to be an astronomer in those days.)</p>

<p>Alas, it turns out that, while the invention of the telescope in the early 1600s brought on a veritable flood of lunar drawings, with every astronomer starting from Galileo himself rushing to look at the moon through a telescope and sketch what they saw, <em>very</em> few astronomical (as opposed to purely artistic) drawings of the moon are known from before that period.  Apparently, while those early astronomers were busy compiling remarkably accurate star charts and tracking planetary motions with the naked eye, nobody really though it important to draw an accurate picture of the moon &mdash; after all, if you wanted to know what the moon looked like, all you had to do was look at it yourself.</p>

<p>Perhaps this behavior may be partly explained by the prevailing philosophical opinions at the time, which, influenced by Aristotle, held the heavens to be the realm of order and perfection, as opposed to earthly corruption and imperfection.  The clearly visible ""spots"" on the face of the moon, therefore, were mainly regarded as something of a philosophical embarrassment &mdash; not something to be studied or catalogued, but merely something to be explained away.</p>

<p>In fact, the first and last known ""map of the moon"" drawn purely based on naked-eye observations was drawn by William Gilbert (1540&ndash;1603) and included in his posthumously published work <em>De Mundo Nostro Sublunari</em>.  It is quite remarkable how little detail his map actually includes, even compared to a tiny 40 by 40 pixel image as shown above:</p>

<p>Indeed, even the sketches of the moon published by Galileo Galilei in his famous <em>Sidereus Nuncius</em> in 1610, notable for being based on his telescopic observations, are not much better; they show little detail except near the terminator, and the few details there are appear to be inaccurate bordering on fanciful.  They are, perhaps, better regarded as ""artist's impressions"" than as accurate astronomical depictions:</p>

<p><a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Galileo%27s_sketches_of_the_moon.png"" title=""Galileo&#39;s sketches of the moon from Sidereus Nuncius (1610)""><img src=""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Galileo%27s_sketches_of_the_moon.png/432px-Galileo%27s_sketches_of_the_moon.png"" alt=""Galileo&#39;s sketches of the moon from Sidereus Nuncius (1610)""></a><br>
<sup>Galileo's sketches of the moon, based on early telescopic observations, from <em>Sidereus Nuncius</em> (1610), via Wikimedia Commons.  Few, if any, of the depicted details can be confidently matched to actual lunar features.</sup></p>

<p>Much more accurate drawings of the moon, also based on early telescopic observations, were produced around the same time by Thomas Harriott (1560&ndash;1621), but his work remained unpublished until long after his death.  Harriott's map actually starts to approach, and in some respects exceeds, the detail level of even the 60 pixel photograph above, showing e.g. the shapes of the maria relatively accurately.  It is, however, to be noted that it is presumably based on extensive observations using a telescope, over several lunar cycles (allowing e.g. craters the be more clearly seen when they're close to the terminator):</p>

<p>Based on this historical digression, we may thus conclude that the 40 pixel image of the moon, as shown in the question above, indeed <em>does</em> fairly accurately represent the level of detail visible to an unaided observer, while the 60 pixel image even matches the detail level visible to an observer using a primitive telescope from the early 1600s.</p>

"Which atom is a Neutron star made of?","7053","","<p>I understood that everything was made of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"" rel=""noreferrer"">Atoms</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has
  the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and
  plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star"" rel=""noreferrer"">Neutron Stars</a>;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars
  are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic
  particles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean neutrons can exist outside of an atom, and that a Neutron star isn’t comprised of an element that is recognisable on the periodic table?</p>
","<p>Yes neutrons can exist outside the atom (or nucleus). In free space a neutron will <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">beta decay</a> into a proton, and electron and an anti-neutrino on a timescale of 10 minutes. However, in the dense interiors of a neutron star, the electrons form a degenerate gas, with all possible energy levels filled up to something called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_energy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fermi energy</a>. </p>

<p>Once the Fermi energy of the electrons exceeds the maximum energy of any possible beta-decay electron, then beta decay is blocked and free neutrons become stable. This is what happens inside a neutron star and you end up with mostly neutrons with a small fraction perhaps a few per cent electrons and protons.</p>

<p>In the outer parts of the neutron star, the protons and neutrons can still arrange themselves into nuclei (but not atoms), but these nuclei are extremely neutron-rich (they would not normally exist in nature) and are only stabilised against beta decay by the process I described above. The very outer envelope may consist of completely ionised iron-peak element nuclei and there may be an ultrathin (few cm) layer of recognisable ionised hydrogen, helium and carbon (e.g. <a href=""http://lanl.arxiv.org/pdf/0911.0672v1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wynn &amp; Heinke 2009</a>).</p>

<p>Once the density reaches about $3 \times 10^{16}$ kg/m$^3$ it becomes more favourable for the neutrons and protons to organise themselves into ""macro-nuclei"" - long strings and sheets of nuclear material, known colloquially as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pasta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nuclear pasta</a>.</p>

<p>At higher densities still, the pasta dissolves into a soup of mostly neutrons with about 1 per cent protons and electrons.</p>

<p>The diagram below (from <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3511"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Watanabe et al. 2012</a>) shows roughly how these layers are arranged. It should be stressed that this is based on theoretical modelling, with the theory becoming less certain the further into the neutron star you go. Testing these ideas involves nuclear and particle experiments, observations of pulsars, of neutron star cooling, of X-ray bursts, mass and radius estimates in binary systems, pulsar glitches, etc., etc. None of the <em>details</em> have been observationally confirmed beyond dispute, but the basic picture below fits what we know. In particular, the the crust and the n,p,e fluid regions are well understood in theory. The details of the nuclear pasta phases are still the subject of a lot of theoretical work, as are the details of superfluidity in the interior, and what happens in the very central regions (solid neutron core, extra hadronic phases, boson condensation, quark matter) is still theoretically difficult and observationally untested except perhaps to say that the softest equations of state have been ruled out by the existence of $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars.</p>

","<p>The composition can be determined by taking spectra. Additionally, the mass can be determined through dynamics. If you combine these two, under the assumption that the star is in a state of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hydrostatic equilibrium</a> (which means that the outward thermal pressure of the star due to fusion of hydrogen into helium is in balance with the inward tug of gravity), you can make statements about what the temperature and density <em>must</em> be in the core. You need high densities and high temperatures in order to fuse hydrogen into helium. </p>

<p>Remember what's happening: Temperatures are hot enough for hydrogen in the core to be completely ionized, meaning that in order to fuse these protons into helium nuclei, you need to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion as two protons come close (like charges repel). Below is a diagram of the process of one particular type of fusion (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Proton-proton chain reaction</a>).</p>

"How can there be 1,000 stellar ancestors before our Sun?","6924","","<p>I've heard from a few sources recently that the Sun is a 1,000th generation star, meaning it had a thousand stars that came before it based on it's heavy element content.</p>

<p>I understand that earlier star's supernovae created the heavier elements and those are incorporated into the Sun when it forms and we can calculate the generation based on that. </p>

<p>My question is based on the age of the universe and the age of the Sun and the average age of stars in the galaxy.</p>

<p>Basically, the universe is ~13.7 billion years old, the sun is ~4.6 billion years old (and has ~5 billion years of life left), which means it was formed when the universe was ~9.1 billion years old.</p>

<p>For 1,000 stars to live in that span of time, those stars would have to have an average lifespan of ~9 million years (not including time between stars). This equates to each of those thousand stars having an average mass of ~100-150 solar masses so their lives would be sufficiently short to not go over that ~9 million year lifetime.</p>

<p>So basically, there were 1,000 stars that lived and died before our Sun, all of which were huge monsters. This just all seems so improbable. How can this be?</p>
","<p>The Sun is actually a <strong>THIRD</strong> generation star. What I mean by this, is that there are chemical elements in the Sun that were made inside another star, but that star itself can only have made those elements because it had material in it that must also have been made inside previous, second generation, stars. Eventually we get back to the first generation stars, born out of primordial gas from the big-bang that contained almost no heavy elements (those beyond helium) at all.</p>

<p>That is quite a mouthful, so let me explain using an example - barium.</p>

<p>There is barium in the Sun. We can tell that by looking at the spectrum and seeing absorption lines due to barium. But barium cannot be made in the Sun. The barium is made via the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">s-process</a>, which involves the slow capture of neutrons onto the nuclei of iron-peak elements. This happens during the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_giant_branch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">asymptotic red giant branch phase</a> of stellar evolution, and the Sun has 6 billion years or so before it gets to that point. [NB: not even half the abundance of chemical elements beyond iron are produced by supernovae explosions$^1$.]</p>

<p>So, before the Sun, there must have existed a star - probably an intermediate mass star - which evolved to become a giant, made barium in its interior, then lost its envelope through a massive wind into the interstellar medium, and that material was incorporated into the protosun. Such stars (between say 2 and 10 solar masses) would have much shorter lifetimes than the Sun$^2$, so plenty of time for them to live and die before the Sun was born.</p>

<p>But wait a minute! That previous star must have <em>already</em> had iron-peak elements in its interior to act as a ""seed"" for the s-process production of barium. These were not and could not be made inside that star. They must have been made in a previous star, probably a massive star, that burned through all the nuclear fusion stages before exploding as a supernova, casting heavy elements, including iron-peak elements, into the interstellar medium. This previous star could also have had its own (metal-rich) ancestors, but ultimately as we go back in time we reach a point where the previous star was a <em>first</em> generation star, made from primordial H/He gas, with almost no heavy elements. These first generation (a.k.a. population III stars, just to be confusing), were probably very massive and short lived - a few million years. They would be born when the universe was a few hundred million years old and we can see no examples of them in our Galaxy today.</p>

<p>To try and define more precisely what I mean by ""generation"".</p>

<ul>
<li>First generation - made from primordial big bang material.</li>
<li>Second generation - a star made only from the detritus of dying first    generation stars, enriched in heavy elements; lacking in primary s-process elements.</li>
<li>Third generation - a star made from material already enriched in heavy elements and including elements that are produced in the s-process inside previous second (or third) generation stars.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that is why I claim the Sun can be classed as a ""third generation star"" - it contains atoms/nuclei that must have been inside <em>at least</em> two previous stars.</p>

<p>But you should not take this too literally. There are grains of material trapped inside meteorites that consist of solids that were already present in the pre-solar material. These are important because these grains were thought to have formed in <em>individual</em> stellar events and their isotopic compositions can be studied. These tell us that the Sun formed from material that has been inside <em>many</em> different stars of different types.</p>

<p>Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations tell us the same story. For example, whilst most of our oxygen was made in massive stars that underwent a core collapse supernova, such events do not produce that much carbon. The C/O ratio tells us that most of our carbon comes via the winds from intermediate mass AGB stars. Heavy elements like uranium may be dominantly produced in neutron star collisions, but others like barium and strontium are not.</p>

<p>The details of how many ancestors have contributed to the Sun has no simple answer. Much of the solar hydrogen and helium could be pristine; some will have been through more than one star. Heavier elements (bar some lithium) will have been through at least one star. The fact that we have s-process elements like Ba, Sr, La and Ce, which are formed by neutron capture onto iron-peak elements, tells us those have been through <em>at least</em> two stars. </p>

<p>However, these are <em>vast</em> under-estimates. Mixing in the interstellar medium is reasonably effective. The material spewed out from supernovae and stellar winds 5-12 billion years ago has had plenty of time to mix throughout the Galaxy before the Sun's birth. Turbulence and shear instabilities, driven by the winds ans supernovae from massive stars, should distribute material on galactic length scales in a billion years or less (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995A%26A...294..432R"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Roy &amp; Kunth 1995</a>; <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0208441"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">de Avillez &amp; Mac Low 2003</a>), though local inhomogeneities associated with nearby recent events can persist over $10^{8}$ years. If this is the case, then the Sun is the product of the $\sim$ billion stars that died before it was born.</p>

<p>The reason you are confused with your lifetime argument is that you have ignored the possibility of the Sun being made from stars that lived <em>at the same time</em> in different parts of the Galaxy. The material that they ejected near the end of their lives has just been thoroughly mixed up.</p>

<p>$^1$ The rest are produced by the s-process in intermediate mass AGB stars; through nova events on white dwarfs; or perhaps in the case of the heavier elements, through the collision of neutron stars (see <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/7131/origin-of-elements-heavier-than-iron-fe?lq=1"">this Physics SE question</a>).</p>

"Can the moon appear to be in any position in the sky?","6898","","<p>It seems to me that the Moon has appeared in many locations - apparent locations - in the 'dome of the sky'.

My question is: can the moon appear in any (every?) location in the 'dome of the sky'?</p>
","<p>Like the sun, the moon, from our perspective on the surface of the Earth, rises in the East and sets in the West. However, it does not rise exactly due East and set exactly due West. If you were to track the position of the moonrise along the horizon over the course of a year, you would notice that is varies considerably. <em>It cannot, however, be located everywhere in the night sky, even over the course of a year.</em> To understand why, we need to understand some celestial geometry.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The ecliptic plane is the plane which a hypothetical line between the Earth and the sun sweeps out over the course of a year. In the image above, you can see 
how the Earth's orbit exists within this plane. </p></li>
<li><p>Also notice that the line from the Earth's geographic south pole through its north pole (its rotational axis) is not perpendicular to this ecliptic plane. In fact it is 23.5 degrees off this perpendicular direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that the Earth's rotational axis points in the same direction regardless of which side of the Sun the Earth is currently on. This rotational axis always points towards the star Polaris. This means that on different parts of the year, the sun will rise at varying points along the horizon. </p></li>
<li><p>The Earth's equatorial plane is a plane defined to extend out from the Earth's equator in all directions. This plane is inclined relative to the ecliptic plane by 23.5 degrees (the same amount as the rotational axis is tilted relative to the perpendicular direction of the ecliptic plane).</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Earth-Moon.PNG/300px-Earth-Moon.PNG"" alt=""Earth Moon System""></p>

<p>Now consider the Earth moon system. In order to determine how far North or South the moon can appear to rise from, you need to consider the angle between the Earth's equatorial plane and the moon's orbital plane. Since the Earth's rotational axis is inclined 23.5 degrees relative to the ecliptic, and the Moon's orbit is inclined 5.14 degrees relative to the ecliptic, the highest the Moon's orbit can be relative to the equatorial plane of the Earth is 28.64 degrees. </p>

<p>Thus, the Moon cannot be directly overhead of any point on the surface of the Earth if that point is 28.64 degrees above or (by an symmetric argument) below the equator.</p>

<p>Thus, the Moon cannot appear in every location in the sky for a given location on Earth. There are parts of the sky that the geometry of the Earth moon system simply will not permit the Moon to exist.</p>

"Would time go by infinitely fast when crossing the event horizon of a black hole?","6537","","<p>If you were to fall into a black hole, my understanding is that from your reference point, time would speed up (looking out to the rest of the universe), approaching infinity when approaching the event horizon.

","<p>(I will assume a Schwarzschild black hole for simplicity, but much of the following is morally the same for other black holes.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you were to fall into a black hole, my understanding is that from your reference point, time would speed up (looking out to the rest of the universe), approaching infinity when approaching the event horizon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Schwarzschild coordinates,
$$\mathrm{d}\tau^2 = \left(1-\frac{2m}{r}\right)\mathrm{d}t^2 - \left(1-\frac{2m}{r}\right)^{-1}\mathrm{d}r^2 - r^2\,\mathrm{d}\Omega^2\text{,}$$
the gravitational redshift $\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}$ describes the time dilation of a <em>stationary observer</em> at a given Schwarzschild radial coordinate $r$, compared to a stationary observer at infinity. You can check this easily: plug in $\mathrm{d}r = \mathrm{d}\Omega = 0$, the condition that neither the radial nor the angular coordinates are changing (i.e. stationary observer), and solve for $\mathrm{d}\tau/\mathrm{d}t$.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that if you have the rocket power to hover arbitrarily close to the horizon, you will be able to see arbitrarily far into the history of the universe over your lifetime. However, that doesn't actually cover what happens to an observer that crosses the horizon. In that case, $\mathrm{d}r\not=0$, and the coefficient of $\mathrm{d}r^2$ above becomes undefined at the horizon: as in the other question, the Schwarzschild coordinate chart simply fails to cover the horizon and so is ill-suited for talking about situations cross the horizon.</p>

<p>But that's a fault of the coordinate chart, not of spacetime. There are other coordinate charts that are better adapted to questions like that. For example, the two Eddington-Finkelstein charts are best suited for incoming and outgoing light rays, respectively, and the Gullstrand-Painlevé chart is adapted to a freely falling observer starting from rest at infinity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this is correct, would you see the whole universe's future ""life"" flash before your eyes as you fall in, assuming you could somehow withstand the tremendous forces, and assuming black holes don't evaporate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I think this is best seen from the Penrose diagram of Schwarzschild spacetime:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/grB5f.png"" alt=""Penrose diagram of Schwarazschild spacetime, modified from one by A.Hamilton""></p>

<p>Light rays run diagonally. In blue is an example infalling trajectory, not necessarily freely falling. Note the two events where it crosses the horizon and where it reaches the singularity. Shown in red are inward light rays that intersect those events. Thus, the events that the infalling observer can see of the external universe consist of the region between those light rays and the horizon. The events occurring after that won't be seen because the the observer will have already reached the singularity by then.</p>

<p>Now suppose the observer tries a different trajectory after crossing the horizon, accelerating outward as much as possible in order to see more of the future history of the external universe. This will only work up to a point: the best the observer can do is hug the outgoing light ray (diagonally from lower-left to upper-right) as much as possible... but since the observer is not actually allowed to go at the speed of light, seeing <em>all</em> of the future of history will be impossible. The best the observer can do is to meet the singularity a bit more on the right of the diagram.</p>

<p>By the way, since the light ray worldlines have zero proper time, trying to do that will actually shorten the the observer's lifespan. If you're in a Schwarzschild black hole, you would live longer if you don't struggle to get out.</p>

<p>The above is for an eternal, non-evaporating black hole, as that's what you're asking about here. (The 'antihorizon' is there because the full Schwarzschild spacetime is actually an eternal black hole and its mirror image, a white hole in a mirror 'anti-verse', which not shown on this diagram. That's unphysical, but not relevant to the situation we're considering here.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it is correct that black holes evaporate due to Hawking radiation, would you be ""transported"" forward in time to where the black hole fully evaporates? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>An evaporating black hole is morally the same as above: only an ideal light ray can reach the point when the black hole fully evaporates; everyone else gets the singularity. (Since this ideal light ray right along the horizon would be infinitely redshifted, arguably not even that.) You can repeat the above reasoning on its Penrose diagram yourself:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2i0ao.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p><em>Addendum</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have thought a bit about this, and does this solution take into account the relativistic time effects near the horizon of the black hole (e.g. is my understanding correct that the observer would observe time in the universe passing approaching infinitely fast when approaching the event horizon)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much time dilation happens depends entirely on what coordinates we're talking about (more generally, which frame field). What a given observer will actually see, however, is completely independent of choice of coordinates. In particular, Penrose diagrams illustrate the light cone structure of the given spacetime, and what an observer can in principle see depends entirely on what light rays intersect the observer's wordline. So yes, it's taken into account by default.</p>

<p>If you're actually falling in it, no, your understanding is mistaken, for reasons explained above. For additional motivation, flip the question around: what does the very distant stationary observer see of the infalling object? On the above Penrose diagram, outwardly directed light rays are diagonal, from lower-left to upper-right. Draw some some outward light rays from the blue infalling worldline. You will see that no matter how far into the far future (<em>up</em> on the diagram) you pick an event outside the black hole to be, you can connect that event with an outward light ray originating from the blue infalling worldline <em>before</em> it crosses the horizon. The conclusion would be that an observer that stays outside the black hole would be able to see the infalling object arbitrarily far into the future. No matter how much time passes for someone who stays out of the black hole, the image of the infalling object would still be visible as it was before it crossed the horizon. (In principle at least; in practice it will get too faint to see after a while.)</p>

<p>Thus, the usual result of ""infinite gravitational time dilation makes the image of the infalling object hover forever near the horizon"" is <em>also</em> straightforwardly deducible from the diagram, and so is completely consistent with the infalling object being able to see a finite part into the future of the external universe. Perhaps it is best to emphasize that the situation is not actually symmetric: what the external observer sees of the infalling object is not some straightforward flip-around of what the infalling object sees of the external universe. The black hole itself breaks that symmetry.</p>

"Is it possible to achieve a stable ""lunarstationary"" orbit around the moon?","6324","","<p>Is there a stable geostationary orbit around the moon?</p>

<p>My feeling is, that the orbit would collide with earth, because of the moon's slow rotation.</p>
","<p>First off, such an orbit wouldn't be a <em>geostationary</em> orbit since <em>geo-</em> refers to the Earth. A more appropriate name would be <em>lunarstationary</em> or <em>selenostationary</em>. I'm not sure if there is an officially accepted term since you rarely hear people talk about such an orbit.</p>

<p>You can calculate the orbital distance of a selenostationary orbit using Kepler's law:</p>

<p>$$a = \left(\frac{P^2GM_{\text{Moon}}}{4\pi^2}\right)^{1/3}$$</p>

<p>In this case, $a$ is your orbital distance of interest, $P$ is the orbital period (which we know to be 27.321 days or 2360534 seconds), $G$ is just the gravitational constant, and hopefully it is obvious that $M_{\text{Moon}}$ is the mass of the Moon. All we have to do is plug in numbers. I find that</p>

<p>$$a = 88,417\:\mathrm{km}=0.23\:\mathrm{Earth\mathit{-}Moon\:Distance}$$</p>

<p>So I at least match your calculation pretty well. I think you were just relying on Wolfram Alpha a bit too much to get the units right. The units do work out right though.</p>

<p>If you want to determine if this orbit can exist however, you need to do a bit more work. As a first step, calculate the Moon's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hill Sphere</a>. This is the radius at which the Moon still maintains control over it's satellite, without the Earth causing problems. The equation for this radius is given by</p>

<p>$$r \approx a_{\text{Moon}}(1-e_{\text{Moon}})\sqrt[3]{\frac{M_{\text{Moon}}}{3M_{\text{Earth}}}}$$</p>

<p>In this equation, $a_{\text{Moon}} = 348,399\:\mathrm{km}$ is the Moon's semi-major axis around the Earth and $e_{\text{Moon}} = 0.0549$ is the Moon's orbital eccentricity. I'm sure you can figure out that the $M$'s are the masses of the respective bodies. Just plug and chug and you get</p>

<p>$$r \approx 52,700\:\mathrm{km}$$</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1964SvA.....7..618C/0000622.000.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">more careful calculation</a>, including the effects of the Sun is slightly more optimistic and provides a Hill radius of $r = 58,050\:\mathrm{km}$. In either case though, hopefully you can see that the radius for a selenostationary orbit is much farther than the Hill radius, meaning that no stable orbit can be achieved as it would be too much perturbed by the Earth and/or the Sun.</p>

<p>One final, semi-related point. It turns out almost no orbits around the Moon are stable, even if they're inside the Hill radius. This is primarily to do with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_concentration_(astronomy)"" rel=""noreferrer"">mass concentrations</a> (or mascons) in the Moon's crust and mantle which make the gravitational field non-uniform and act to degrade orbits.

"How can I collimate a dobsonian telescope with a laser collimator?","6314","","<p>I've had a dobsonian telescope for a while now, but I've never been able to collimate  it. I thought I had it collimated once, but when I looked through it the star didn't look right, it looked kind of like a round disc with a hole in the middle. I know the basic idea behind doing it with a laser collimator, you need to get the laser to line up with the center of the primary mirror as well as line up in the center of the target on the laser itself. However, I always have a lot of difficult accomplishing this.</p>

<p>For starters, I always have a lot of trouble getting the secondary mirror lined up. I'll get really close, but once I get close I have a lot of trouble doing the fine tuning to get the laser in the middle. I'll get it in, but when I got to tighten the other screws it will no longer be lined up. I'll try to account for the tightening as well, but it's always a guessing game for me when it comes to knowing which screws to loosen and tighten so that the laser winds up where I want.   </p>

<p>I don't have that many problems with the primary mirror, and can normally get that lined up fairly easily. However, usually after lining up the primary mirror the secondary mirror no longer seemed to be lined up and I need to do the secondary mirror all over again. I'm assuming this is to be expected, but considering the difficulty I have lining up the secondary mirror it's very frustrating. </p>

<p>I've tried looking around at resources online, but none of them go into enough detail into aligning the secondary mirror. They just say ""adjust the screws until it's lined up"", which doesn't solve my problem, since I have trouble figuring out exactly which screws to adjust and when. I'm also confused as to what I should see through my telescope when it is properly aligned. Most of the sites just use a diagram, but I'm never really sure what to make of the diagram. The one time I did line it up it looked like a round disc with a hole in the middle, which I didn't think looked right.</p>

<p>So to summarize, the main problems I have are:  </p>

<ul>
<li>I have trouble fine tuning the secondary mirror, since I have trouble accounting for the movement of the mirror when tightening the two screws I didn't loosen   </li>
<li>I'm not sure what a star should look like through my telescope when it is properly collimated </li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone offer some detailed instructions, and possibly a video, of how to collimate a dobsonian telescope with a laser collimator? </p>
","<p><sup><strong>Note to future answerers</strong>: We have been working in the <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/?tab=site&amp;host=astronomy.stackexchange.com"">Astronomy.SE main chat room</a> with OP to solve this problem and established it's actually a matter of focusing that resulted in problems described (telescope was either too intrafocal or extrafocal), not collimation itself.

<p><sup>Now, let's answer the actual question.</sup></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Preparing our laser collimation setup</strong></p>

<p>First thing to know is that any laser collimator will likely have the beam strong enough to cause damage to your eyes if pointed directly in them, or damage strong light sensitive equipment, like for example digital cameras, so be careful with it and take precautions. Carefully read instructions on how to handle and use it, before you do so. This is how a laser collimator might look like:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gyJob.jpg"" alt=""laser collimator""></p>

<p>Next thing to do is make it functional by inserting batteries or plugging its power adapter and testing it actually works by turning it on with the switch, if it has it (probably does). Once you'll establish your laser collimator is turned on and functioning by observing (usually ruby red) light beam spot it makes on any neutral surface, turn it back off and attach any adapters on it you might need to help you attach it to your telescope's focuser. This is how your telescope's OTA (Optical Tube Assembly) might look like:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RyUiC.png"" alt=""OTA (Optical Tube Assembly)""></p>

<p>Now remove the barlov and eyepiece from your telescope's focuser if you're using a direct focuser adapter for your telescope model, tighten the laser collimator's compression ring by rotating its rubber ring and attach the collimator into the focuser. Rotate collimator's compression rings to tighten it in place. If you're not using an adapter, your laser collimator might attach directly to your eyepiece. Consult your collimator's user manual, if unsure.</p>

<p>Rotate your collimator's targeting faceplate towards your telescope's primary mirror (on the telescope's bottom) and turn on the laser.</p>

<p><strong>Angular alignment of the secondary mirror</strong></p>

<p>By looking into the telescope <em>top down</em> from the secondary (top) mirror into the telescope, we will adjust the angular alignment of the secondary mirror by referencing the laser dot projecting on the primary (bottom) mirror. The secondary mirror's support has a center ring, the collimating cap, with three bolts on the top of the secondary mirror holder. Use Allen wrench or Phillip's screwdriver to rotate them individually to bring the laser dot into the center of the <em>doughnut</em> ring of the primary mirror, like so:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E79kX.png"" alt=""primary mirror doughnut""></p>

<p>Try to bring the dot more directly into the <em>doughnut</em> center than on the photograph above, though. I intentionally didn't select a photograph from when it was in its dead center, because of the light reflection covering the <em>doughnut</em> ring completely, rendering it nearly invisible.</p>

<p><strong>Primary mirror collimation</strong></p>

<p>Unlock the primary mirror plate locking screws, position yourself towards the panel side of the primary mirror tube so you can observe the laser's center spot on the targeting faceplate on the collimator and start adjusting collimation screws by turning them gently until the laser dot is in the center of the targeting faceplate:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fVorO.png"" alt=""Primary mirror collimation""></p>

<p>Another way to check your collimation progress when adjusting collimation screws is by checking the projection laser dots on the secondary (top) mirror and making sure both laser dots are overlapping into one single spot, but that might make your adjustments of the primary mirror somewhat harder, so using the targeting faceplate of the laser collimator would be my suggestion and perhaps check alignment of the secondary mirrors laser dots projection for the last finishing touches to collimate your mirrors as precise as possible.</p>

<p>Now you're done collimating your dobsonian or newtonian telescope, so it's time to remove the laser collimator by first switching it off, then untightening its compression ring and taking it out of the focuser. Once you've removed the laser collimator, insert in the focuser barlov and the eyepiece, and tighten them back in place.</p>

<p>Standard collimation technique for the exact dobsonian telescope make OP mentioned has can be read in this <a href=""http://www.ursa.fi/fileadmin/ursa2010/kuvat/kirjakauppa/Dob2002.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Instruction Manual for Sky-Watcher dobsonians</a> (PDF):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Collimation is the process of aligning the mirrors of your  telescope
  so that they work in concert with each other to  deliver properly
  focused light to your eyepiece. By observing  out-of-focus star
  images, you can test whether your  telescope's optics are aligned.
  Place a star in the centre of  the field of view and move the focuser
  so that the image is  slightly out of focus. If the seeing conditions
  are good, you  will see a central circle of light (the Airy disc)
  surrounded by a  number of diffraction rings. If the rings are
  symmetrical about  the Airy disc, the telescope's optics are correctly
  collimated  (Fig.g).</p>
  
  <p>If you do not have a collimating tool, we suggest that you  make a
  ""collimating cap"" out of a plastic 35mm film canister  (black with
  gray lid). Drill or punch a small pinhole in the exact  center of the
  lid and cut off the bottom of the canister. This  device will keep
  your eye centered of the focuser tube. Insert  the collimating cap
  into the focuser in place of a regular  eyepiece. </p>
  
  <p>Collimation is a painless process and works like this:</p>
  
  <p>Pull off the lens cap which covers the front of the telescope  and
  look down the optical tube. At the bottom you will see the  primary
  mirror held in place by three clips 120º apart, and at  the top the
  small oval secondary mirror held in a support and  tilted 45º toward
  the focuser outside the tube wall (Fig.h). The secondary mirror is
  aligned by adjusting the central bolt  behind it, (which moves the
  mirror up and down the tube),  and the three smaller screws
  surrounding the bolt, (which  adjust the angle of the mirror). The
  primary mirror is adjusted  by the three adjusting screws at the back
  of your scope. The  three locking screws beside them serve to hold the
  mirror in  place after collimation. (Fig.i)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Aligning the Secondary Mirror</strong></p>
  
  <p>Point the telescope at a lit wall and insert the  collimating cap into
  the focuser in place of a regular  eyepiece. Look into the focuser
  through your collimating  cap. You may have to twist the focus knob a
  few turns  until the reflected image of the focuser is out of your 
  view. Note: keep your eye against the back of the focus  tube if
  collimating without a collimating cap. Ignore the  reflected image of
  the collimating cap or your eye for  now, instead look for the three
  clips holding the primary  mirror in place. If you can't see them
  (Fig.j), it means  that you will have to adjust the three bolts on the
  top of  the secondary mirror holder, with possibly an Allen  wrench or
  Phillip's screwdriver. You will have to  alternately loosen one and
  then compensate for the  slack by tightening the other two. Stop when
  you see all  three mirror clips (Fig.k). Make sure that all three
  small  alignment screws are tightened to secure the  secondary mirror
  in place.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Aligning the Primary Mirror</strong></p>
  
  <p>There are 3 hex bolts and 3 Phillip's head screws  at the back of your
  telescope, the hex bolts are the  locking screws and the
  Phillip's-head screws are  the adjusting screws (Fig.l). Use an Allen
  wrench  to loosen the hex bolts by a few turns. Now run  your hand
  around the front of your telescope  keeping your eye to the focuser,
  you will see the  reflected image of your hand. The idea here being 
  to see which way the primary mirror is defected,  you do this by
  stopping at the point where the  reflected image of the secondary
  mirror is closest  to the primary mirrors' edge (Fig.m).  When you get
  to that point, stop and keep your  hand there while looking at the
  back end of your  telescope, is there a adjusting screw there? If
  there  is you will want to loosen it (turn the screw to the  left) to
  bring the mirror away from that point. If  there isn't a adjusting
  screw there, then go across  to the other side and tighten the
  adjusting screw on  the other side. This will gradually bring the
  mirror  into line until it looks like Fig.n. (It helps to have a 
  friend to help for primary mirror collimation. Have  your partner
  adjust the adjusting screws according  to your directions while you
  look in the focuser.) After dark go out and point your telescope at 
  Polaris, the North Star. With an eyepiece in the  focuser, take the
  image out of focus. You will see  the same image only now, it will be
  illuminated by  starlight. If necessary, repeat the collimating 
  process only keep the star centered while tweaking  the mirror.</p>

"What did LIGO Actually See? (Gravitational waves discovery)","6263","","<p>I am trying to find an original video/image of what LIGO actually saw, but all I can find is artist renditions of gravitational waves.</p>
","<p>The actual image isn't much. I was able to find it from <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/gravitational-waves-einstein-s-ripples-spacetime-spotted-first-time"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Science</em></a>, and this is all it is:</p>

<p>It's just a ripple, seen at slightly different times from two different observatories. The shift fits perfectly by shifting it by the speed of light difference in their locations. Thus is the proof of gravity waves.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the reason there are two instruments is to provide a cross check against other vibration sources. Each observatory works by detecting vibrations on a 4 km scale, down to a very small order of magnitude (1/10,000 the width of a proton). When the two are compared, then one can assume the signal must have come from a non-local source, which only Gravity Waves fit that definition.</p>

"What is the fastest spinning rotation of a Neutron star?","6164","","<p>What is the fastest spinning rotation of a Neutron star? I have heard that Neutron stars have a specially fast spinning rotation. What is the fastest?</p>
","<p>As it turns out, the fastest spinning neutron star found yet is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar"">pulsar</a> 18000 light years away in the constelation of Sagittarius which scientist catalogued as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_J1748-2446ad""><strong>PSR J1748-2446ad</strong></a>. Pulsars are neutron stars that rotate, are highly magnetic and emit a strong perpendicular beam of electromagnetic radiation.</p>

<p>This pulsar's speed is such that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At its equator it is spinning at approximately 24% of the speed of light, or over 70,000 km per second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>PSR J1748-2446ad</strong> rotates a little over 700 times a second, and scientists have this to say on the theoretical limits of the rotation speed of a pulsar (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond_pulsar"">from here</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current theories of neutron star structure and evolution predict that pulsars would break apart if they spun at a rate of ~1500 rotations per second or more, and that at a rate of above about 1000 rotations per second they would lose energy by gravitational radiation faster than the accretion process would speed them up.</p>

"How far is the Earth/Sun above/below the galactic plane, and is it heading toward/away from it?","6158","","<p>How far is the Earth/Sun above/below the galactic plane, and is it heading toward/away from it?
We know the Sun is orbiting the galactic center every 225 million years.
But how far are we from the galactic plane, and is the inclination of the plane of the Sun's orbit around the galactic center, as compared to the galactic plane, known?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PERqj.jpg"" alt=""Direction of Sun&#39;s motion""></p>

<p>According to this drawing</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ODdl.gif"" alt=""Direction of Sun&#39;s motion""></p>

<p>the Sun is traveling approximately in the ecliptic plane.
However, the ecliptic plane is steeply inclined to the galactic plane, so if this drawing is correct (from voyager.jpl.nasa.gov) then this would mean the plane of the Sun's orbit around the galactic center is also quite inclined.
And thus my question, what is the distance to the galactic plane, are we heading toward/away from it, and what is the inclination of the orbital plane of our Sun/solar system to the galactic plane? 3 questions I guess.</p>
","<p>According to this article, we are somewhere between 75 and 101 light years above the plane and getting closer.  So we won't be crossing it for quite some time.</p>

"Why hasn't the ""9th Planet"" been detected already?","5982","","<p>In the comments to <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/13313/182"">this question</a>, there was considerable doubt placed as to the subject of if the so called ""9th planet"" really exists. That wasn't really the intent of the previous question, so I ask this. Why hasn't this ""9th planet"" been detected before now, if it even exists?</p>
","<p>Brown and Batygin, the authors of the paper on the possible planet, have a <a href=""http://www.findplanetnine.com/p/blog-page.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">webpage</a> addressing this.</p>

<p>A few reasons not already covered:</p>

<ul>
<li>It moves quite slowly - the authors estimate 0.2-0.6 arc seconds per hour - so standard surveys may not notice the movement and fail to recognize it as a solar system object.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eris, which is the most distant confirmed object still known in the
  solar system, moves at a speed of 1.5 arcseconds per hour, which is so
  slow that it was missed the first time around. Most surveys of the
  outer solar system would not be able to find Planet Nine, even if it
  were quite bright, as they would just think it is a stationary star.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>If the planet is near aphelion, it might be an order of magnitude further away than any major or minor planet we've found so far (excluding exoplanets, which are found by methods that don't apply in this case). The authors suggest an aphelion between 500 and 1200 AU. For comparison, Pluto is at 30-50 AU, while Eris at around 100 AU wasn't discovered until 2005. The potential 9th planet would be far larger than Eris, but is also likely to be much further away, and thereby fainter.</p></li>
<li><p>The WISE survey eliminated <a href=""http://www.space.com/24989-planet-x-search-nasa-telescope.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Saturn-sized planets within 10,000 AU</a>, and Jupiter-sized planets within 26,000 AU. But the potential 9th planet is far smaller than those. WISE has also done a more sensitive search, which would pick up Neptune-sized objects, but that search has so far covered only a limited part of the sky.</p></li>
<li><p>The planet will be far harder to spot if it has the Milky Way in the background - there are too many stars potentially drowning out a faint object.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the authors' summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The biggest unexplored territory is where, statistically, it is most
  likely to be: near aphelion. Sadly, aphelion is also very close to the
  Milky Way galaxy. Ugh.</p>
  
  <p>So where is it? Probably distant. 500 AU+. Probably fainter than 22nd 
  magnitude. Very possibly in the middle of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

"What's the likelihood of the existence of unknown elements in the Solar System?","5857","","<p>What's the chance that there might be undiscovered chemical elements in the Solar System - either on planets or around the Sun or on asteroids of the Oort-cloud?</p>
","<p>As far as elements (e.g. on the periodic table) go, I would say the odds are very slim.  We already discovered or produced all the elements of the Periodic Table up to atomic number 112 at least.  As the number increases, the half lives of the elements generally decreases, and is very short for elements above 102. If this trend holds true as the number increases, practically all the ""undiscovered"" elements should have turned into the lower known atomic number elements.</p>

<p>However, there is hope.  There is a theorized ""island of stability"" where a narrow range of yet to be discovered high atomic number elements may be stable: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability</a>

"Is Sun a part of a binary system?","5740","","<p>Does our Sun have a counterpart, i.e., is it a part of a binary-system? If so, how does the other star look like and where is it? </p>
","<p>There is no observational evidence that the sun is a member of a binary (trinary, or more) star system, where ""star"" means an object that is at least ~80 times the mass of jupiter and emits energy/light via standard hydrogen fusion.</p>

<p>Some evidence that people point to is that the majority of stars in the Galaxy (perhaps 60% or so) are binary.  However, that does not mean that we are a binary system, just that we are among those which are not.</p>

<p>There is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_(hypothetical_star)"">Nemesis star</a> idea which was a hypothetical binary companion to the sun to account for periodic mass extinctions roughy every 26 million years (as in, the two stars would therefore be on a 26 million year period, so the companion is a few light-years away).  There are two problems with that:  First, that a 2010 reanalysis of the data showed that it was <em>too</em> periodic over the past 500 million years, during which time we've gone around the galaxy twice, and so our hypothetical binary orbits should have been perturbed and not be perfect (though others say that the precision of the geologic timescale isn't good enough to say this).  But, second, we can see stars out to a few light years -- we can see small, faint stars out to thousands of light years.  We have all-sky infrared surveys that should be able to pick up the faintest even star-like objects to at least a few light-years, and yet ... nothing.</p>

<p>The other problem is what LDC3 pointed out in their answer: We should see some systematic motion of our own star in orbit around the common center of mass of the hypothetical binary.  This would not be a yearly wobble, but rather it would be a slow motion of the entire sky on top of the other >1 year motions that we see.  We now have very accurate astronomical records dating back at least a century of star positions, especially close stars.  Even if we were on a 26 million year orbit - and especially one much shorter as some people claim - we should see effectively that our star is making a small arc, a part of a circle as it orbits the center of mass of it and the binary.  We don't.  There does not seem to be any systematic signal in the motions of stars that require the binary star model.</p>

<p>So, to summarize: A binary companion simply lacks any observational data; if it existed, we should not only have been able to see it by now, but we should also observe not only the stars in our sky show a systematic motion due to our orbit around it, but we should again see THAT binary star also move very quickly, relative to other stars, as it orbits the common center of mass.</p>

"Is the universe considered to be flat?","5549","","<p>I've read various articles and books (like <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0824707095"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>) stating that we are not certain about the geometry of the universe, but there were experiments on-going or planned that would help us find out.</p>

<p>Recently though, I've watched a lecture by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_M._Krauss"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cosmologist Lawrence Krauss</a> where he seems to categorically assert that the universe has been proven to be flat by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOOMERanG_experiment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BOOMERanG experiment</a>. <a href=""https://youtu.be/veU6hK3jMH4?t=12m25s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's the relevant portion of the talk</a>.</p>

<p>I've looked around and there are still articles stating that we still don't know the answer to this question, like <a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/103-the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/geometry-of-space-time/604-what-is-the-shape-of-the-universe-intermediate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>.</p>

<p>So, my question is two-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I mixing concepts and talking about different things?</li>
<li>If not then is this evidence not widely accepted by some reason? What reason would that be?</li>
</ol>
","<p>I think the reason you're suffering from conflicting sources is that you're mixing both new and old, out-of-date pieces of information. First off, the book you cited was published in 2001 - 15 years ago - and the other article you cite was published in 1999 - 17 years ago. There's been a <em>lot</em> of work done in the past 15 years, often under the term ""precision cosmology"", in an attempt to really nail down the precise content, shape, size, etc. of our Universe. By the early 2000's we pretty much knew the science behind everything (we knew about dark matter, dark energy, had well-developed theories on the Big Bang, etc.) but what we didn't have, were good, solid, believable numbers to put into these theories, explaining why the flatness of the universe was still contested in your sources.</p>

<p>I'll direct you to two incredibly important observatories which have been paramount in achieving our goal of having ""good numbers"". The first is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe (WMAP)</a>, launched in 2001, and the second is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Planck satellite</a>, launched in 2009. Both missions were designed to stare intently at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)</a> radiation and try to sort out the treasure trove of information which can be gleaned from it. In this vein, you might also come upon the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)</a>, launched in 1989. This satellite had a similar purpose as the other two, but was not nearly as precise as the later two missions as to provide us with good numbers and definitive statements by the early 2000's. For that reason I'll mostly focus on what WMAP and Planck have told us.</p>

<p>WMAP was a hugely successful mission which stared at the CMB for 9 years and created the most detailed and comprehensive map of its day. With 9 years of data, scientists were really able to reduce the observational errors on various cosmological quantities, including the flatness of the universe. You can see a table of their <a href=""https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current/params/lcdm_wmap9.cfm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">final cosmological parameters here</a>. For the flatness, what you want to do is add up $\Omega_b$ (the baryonic matter density), $\Omega_d$ (the dark matter density), and $\Omega_\Lambda$ (the dark energy density). This will give you the <a href=""http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/D/Density+Parameter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">overall density parameter</a>, $\Omega_0$, which tells you the flatness of our universe. As I'm sure you know from your sources, if $\Omega_0 &lt; 1$ we have a hyperbolic universe, if $\Omega_0 = 1$ our universe is flat, and $\Omega_0 &gt; 1$ implies a spherical universe. From the results of WMAP, we have that $\Omega_0 = 1.000 \pm 0.049$ (someone can check my math) which is very close to one, indicating a flat universe. As far as I know, WMAP was the first instrument to give a truly precise measurement of $\Omega_0$, allowing us to say definitively that our universe appears flat. As you say, the BOOMERanG experiment also provided good evidence for this, but I don't think the results were nearly as powerful as WMAP's was.</p>

<p>The other important satellite here is Planck. Launched in 2009, this satellite has provided us with the best high precision measurements of the CMB to-date. I'll let you dig through their results in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01589v3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">their paper</a>, but the punchline is that they measure the flatness of our universe to be $\Omega_0 = 0.9986 \pm 0.0314$ (calculated from this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model#Parameters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">result table</a>), again extremely close to one.</p>

<p>In conclusion, recent results (within the past 15 years) allow us to definitively state that our Universe appears flat. I don't think, at this time, anyone contests that or believes it is still uncertain. As it usually goes with science, answering one question has only resulted in more questions. Now that we know $\Omega_0 \simeq 1$, we have to ask why is it one? Current theory suggests it shouldn't be - that it should be either enormously small or enormously large. This is known as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flatness Problem</a>. That in turn delves into the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Anthropic Principle</a> as an attempted answer, but then, I'm getting out of the scope of this question.</p>

"How can I accurately find & apply the white donut to the center of my mirror?","5502","","<p>I have a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20061216215456/http://plettstone.com/telescopes/products.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Plettstone 18""</a> Dobsonian telescope and use a <a href=""https://www.collimator.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Howie Glatter</a> tuBlug, laser collimator, and Square Grid Projection Attachment to adjust the mirrors.  Proper collimation requires an accurate identification of the mirror's center. I would like to hear of good methods to very accurately place a white sticky donut concentric to the mirror's optical center.</p>

<p>The mirror already has a donut, but I wonder if it is accurately placed as to my eye it appears slightly off center, but perhaps the optical center is not the physical center?</p>

<p>I've seen a <a href=""http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-to-align-your-newtonian-reflector-telescope/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recommendation in Sky &amp; Telescope</a> to get two clear plastic rulers that bend and place them at exact right angles to each other with the donut upside down lightly stuck to the bottom center cross point and then positioning the rulers evenly and pressing down to bend them toward the mirror and affix the donut.  However, I don't think this method is well suited for an 18"" mirror, perhaps I am mistaken?</p>

<p>I've also seen a <a href=""http://garyseronik.com/centre-dotting-your-scopes-primary-mirror/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recommendation by Gary Seronik</a> to make a paper cutout that matches the mirror shape and to find its center and make a small hole and then place that over the mirror and use a pen to mark the center and center the donut around the marker, however, again, I don't think this is well suited for an 18"" mirror.  This method is also <a href=""http://www.alcoat.net/pap_dot.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mentioned here</a> in some detail, but they specifically state not for use with a laser collimator.</p>

<p>Please suggest how I can first gauge the existing donut for accuracy and if it is found to deviate significantly how to remove it and the adhesive and place a new one more accurately.</p>
","<p>I make my own mirrors and telescopes.</p>

<p>The method recommended by Gary Seronik, that you linked above, is very good, and it's widely used. A few comments:</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to touch the mirror with clean paper. The vast majority of mirrors these days are over-coated with SiO(x) and are quite sturdy. Maybe wash the mirror before you do anything else, this way you'll remove potentially abrasive dust particles. This is how: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y8xFnXFVGQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y8xFnXFVGQ</a> - it's a good idea to wash the mirror anyway, like once a year or every other year.</p>

<p>When making the big paper template, cut the disk from a piece of paper without wrinkles. Draw a good circle, and cut it carefully. Make sure it's flat and it doesn't want to roll up. When centering it, go over the edge again and again, and adjust it so that it's perfectly centered. You center it by working out the edge alignment with the mirror. Take all the time you need.</p>

<p>You could also cut the template out of transparent plastic, larger than the mirror, and just draw a circle on it, the same size like the mirror. This method is recommended by Jim Fly (of Catseye) even for quite large mirrors.</p>

<p>Both versions (paper or plastic) work about the same IMO.</p>

<p>It may take a bit of trial and error to put the central dot on the mirror without smearing it. The marker tends to smear up underneath the paper. Practice on a random piece of glass or polished metal.</p>

<p>The reason why Bob Fies (of Alcoat) says it's not for lasers is that, the way he shows it, the paper dot is solid. Of course it wouldn't work with a bare laser - you need a donut shape, with a hollow center, to allow the laser to reflect (when using a bare laser, not with a tuBlug). Just use a little donut instead of a solid paper dot, for the final step - like Gary shows on his website.</p>

<p>If you never use a bare laser to adjust the primary, a solid dot is fine. But a donut gives you more options.</p>

<p>I've done business with Bob directly, he's very experienced. Like Gary Seronik and Jim Fly, he should be considered an expert in this field. But take his advice in context and look at all the details - he says what he says for a good reason.</p>

<hr>

<p>The way to gauge the existing donut is also by using Gary's method. Make a paper disk with a hole in the middle, center it on the mirror, and put a little dot with a marker on the glass. Compare that dot with your existing donut.</p>

<p>Wipe the marker dot off with alcohol and a q-tip when you're done. You can't damage the mirror unless you press very hard. The center is shadowed by the secondary mirror anyway, so it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Do everything very slowly and be as precise as humanly possible. The precision of the central donut is critical for the precision of your collimation. Since you only put the donut on once, it makes sense to do a very slow but very high quality job.</p>

<p>If the existing donut is off-center even a little bit, don't hesitate to remove it. If alcohol soaking doesn't remove it, try acetone. You may have to clean the center afterwards, but that's okay.</p>

<p>After everything is finished, clean the inside of the donut with alcohol and a q-tip. You need that surface relatively clean, for the laser to reflect back into your collimator when not using the tuBlug (just bare laser). It doesn't have to be squeaky clean, just remove the marker smears, more or less, and make it nice and tidy.</p>

<hr>

<p>Congratulations on taking the right steps. Many, many people don't care about collimation, and it's so important for overall performance. Keep that scope collimated.</p>

<p>The tuBlug is an excellent tool for collimation, it makes the process a snap. Great choice. Catseye is another great collimator, but if you have the tuBlug and a Glatter laser (one of the most precise lasers out there, BTW) you probably don't need anything else, unless you have some extremely low f/ratio on your scope (not your case).</p>

<p>I use the tuBlug every time I do an observation. It's taking maybe 2 minutes to do the adjustments. Totally worth it.</p>

"Speed of light in a black hole","5490","","<p>If I had a directional photon-emitting source and placed it inside a black hole pointing upward and out towards the visible universe, I assume the photons traveling at the speed of light would slow and reverse direction back into the center.</p>

<p>So if I took the same source and placed it outside of the black hole pointing inward towards the black hole center, can I assume that an emitted photon would travel towards the center faster than the speed of light it is already traveling at?</p>
","<p>It doesn't work like that. An observer at the light source (and indeed any observers anywhere else) will always see light travelling (in vacuum) at the speed of light locally.</p>

<p>There is also a major problem with your thought experiment. It is <em>not possible</em> for you to have a stationary light source within the event horizon of a black hole. It, and everything else in its vicinity, <em>must</em> be moving inwards. This is as inexorable and unavoidable as is the passage of time for an observer outside the event horizon.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the best ""visual"" way of thinking about the situation inside the event horizon is to imagine your photons of light like salmon trying to swimming upstream, whilst you are on a boat flowing with the stream and releasing the salmon into the water. You will always see the salmon swimming at some speed with respect to your boat. Unfortunately if the stream flows fast enough then the salmon will make no progress and you will both be swept over a waterfall (the singularity) a little further downstream.</p>

<p>Likewise, your common-sense fails with the situation of firing light towards a black hole. Light is always measured to have a speed of $c$ <em>locally</em>. It is following through with the consequences of this principle that leads to all the weird behaviour that black holes exhibit.</p>

"Do all stars have an Oort cloud or is it a rare occurence?","5369","","<p>Do all stars have an Oort cloud like ours that will be filled with comets and other objects? If not, why are they not around every star?</p>
","<p>Awesome question, especially since we know so little of the answer.</p>

<p>Nobody knows for sure how the Oort Cloud formed - I'll put that out there right now - but the current hypothesis is that it was originally part of the Sun's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">protoplanetary disk</a>. All of the ice and rock coalesced into small bodies - proto-comets, if you will. While these bodies were much closer in to the Sun than they are today, they were tossed far out by gravitational interactions with the gas giants. Other <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_comet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">interstellar comets</a> could also have been captured by the Sun, adding to the population.</p>

<p>So why is the Oort Cloud spherical? After all, the protoplanetary disk was just a flat disk. Why were the orbits of the objects perturbed? Well, the Oort Cloud objects are only loosely bound to the Sun - relatively, that is. They can be influenced by passing stars or other objects. It appears that galactic-scale tidal forces, combined with the influence of passing stars, molded the Cloud into its current spherical shape.</p>

<p>So what does this all tell us? Well, we know other stars have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">protoplanetary disks</a>, right? Some also have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exoplanets</a> - gas giants like Jupiter. They are also subject to tidal forces and the passing of nearby stars. So, theoretically, there's no reason why other stars shouldn't have Oort Clouds.</p>

<p>So can we find them? The answer is, most likely, no. Here's why. According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud#Structure_and_composition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The outer Oort cloud may have trillions of objects larger than 1 km (0.62 mi), and billions with solar system absolute magnitudes brighter than 11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">absolute magnitude of a solar system object</a> of 11 is very dim. Now, the object's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apparent magnitude</a> is how it would look from a given distance; the absolute magnitude is how it looks from a distance of 1 AU (in the case of Solar System objects, this quantity is denoted <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude#Solar_System_bodies_.28H.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">$H$</a>). Oort-cloud objects are 2,000 - 50,000 (or more) AU away-- so these objects, to us in the same solar system, have an apparent magnitude much fainter than 11.</p>

<p>The point of that poorly-explained interlude is that these objects are faint. Very faint. And objects in Oort Clouds around other stars would appear even fainter. Using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_modulus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">distance modulus</a>, we can calculate the apparent magnitude of an object if the distance to that object and its absolute magnitude are known:</p>

<p>$$m-M=5(\log_{10}d-1)$$</p>

<p>(from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)#Apparent_and_absolute_magnitude"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>)</p>

<p>where $m$ is apparent magnitude, $M$ is a scaling of $H$ normally used for stars, and $d$ is the distance in AU.</p>

<p>Given an Oort Cloud object $x$ light-years away, you can figure out how bright (or dim) it would appear, given that 1 light-year is 63241 AU. Try this with the distances of nearby stars, and you'll realize how dim objects in these stars' Oort Clouds would be.</p>

<p>As a final note: We don't know for sure if other Oort Clouds exist. From what I've been able to find, we don't have sufficiently powerful telescopes to observe these hypothetical Clouds, and so we don't (and may never) know if they exist.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>If this is to do with gravity are there any variables which mean we might one day see more than we have before?</p>
","<p>The reason for this is what we call <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking"" rel=""noreferrer"">tidal locking</a></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tidal locking (or captured rotation) occurs when the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_gradient"" rel=""noreferrer"">gravitational

  an effect known as synchronous rotation. For example, the same side of
  the Earth's Moon always faces the Earth. A tidally locked body takes
  just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve
  around its partner. This causes one hemisphere constantly to face the
  partner body. Usually, at any given time only the satellite is tidally
  locked around the larger body, but if the difference in mass between
  the two bodies and their physical separation is small, each may be
  tidally locked to the other, as is the case between <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pluto</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_%28moon%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Charon</a>.

"Astrophotography - Unable to achieve focus with current setup","5298","","<p>I am new to astrophotography and am looking for guidance. I have the following equipment:</p>

<p>Orion StarBlast 9814 4.5"" Altazimuth Reflector Tabletop telescope
1.25in Telescope Adapter Extension Tube T Ring for Canon DSLR SLR Camera DC618
17mm and 6mm lenses
When I uses the lenses in the Telescope Adapter Extension, focus is not achievable. My theory is that the focal plane of most DSLR are 55mm back focus plane. Reflectors are positioned farther back than where the human eye would normally be placed, and hence it is usually difficult if not impossible to bring the camera into focus.</p>

<p>Is this true? Also, would a Barlow lens help achieve focus or be a waste of money? Any other suggestions?</p>
","<p>Yes, the vast majority of small telescopes made for visual observations (like most dobsonians and other newtonian-based architectures) have very limited back focus. In other words, with the focuser retracted all the way in, the focal plane of the primary mirror is sticking out only a short distance. A large back focus is not typically seen, nor is it desirable, in a visual scope. (However, most astrographs have a large back focus.)</p>

<p>This is compounded by the fact that most DSLR have a flange distance (focus-flange distance) which is pretty large - over 45...50 mm in many cases.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an additional distance is wasted by the classic T-ring adapters, which tend to push the camera way back from the focuser's shoulder.</p>

<p>All these factors conspire in your case to prevent you from achieving focus.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some ideas and solutions:</p>

<p><strong>Adapters</strong></p>

<p>I tell everyone who is trying to do prime focus photography with visual scopes (dobsonians, regular newtonians) to ditch the old T-ring system and just buy dedicated adapters. All you need is a piece of metal that goes in the bayonet mount on the camera on one side, and into the focuser on the other side. No need for T- components.</p>

<p>Some such adapters are made by telescopeadapters.com:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.telescopeadapters.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.telescopeadapters.com/</a></p>

<p>I have two adapters like this, they save a very large amount of back focus, compared to the classic T-ring / T-adapter system. In other words, they allow the camera to get much closer to the focuser, and therefore catch the focal plane on the sensor. You just need to choose the kind of adapter that works with your camera.</p>

<p>Most of these adapters are 2"", so in a 1.25"" focuser a size adapter is needed - but that would waste some back focus distance.</p>

<p><strong>Camera</strong></p>

<p>Classic DSLR cameras have a very large flange distance, so a large back focus is needed to overcome it.</p>

<p>Other removable-lens, large-sensor cameras have a much smaller flange distance, if they are mirrorless. Examples: Micro Four Thirds cameras (Panasonic G series), Sony NEX, Samsung NX, etc. All these systems have large sensors (comparable to DSLR) which work well for astrophotography, but don't have moving mirrors, so their flange distances are tiny.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera</a></p>

<p>I have a Panasonic G1, used with the adapter mentioned above. I only need 25 mm of back focus for this to work, which is an extremely small value.</p>

<p><strong>Use a barlow</strong></p>

<p>A barlow would increase the amount of back focus available. Try and see what happens. Keep in mind it cannot work miracles - if you need a very large amount of back focus, it may not work.</p>

<p><strong>Use eyepiece projection</strong></p>

<p>With some eyepieces, you can thread adapters on the user side, and then put the camera body (without lens) on the adapter. Move the eyepiece WAY out of focus, and it will generate a real image which can be projected on the sensor. This is not prime focus photography anymore, but it works and it's better than nothing.</p>

<p>However, such adapters are hard to find, and many eyepieces won't support them.</p>

<p><strong>Use a dedicated USB ""eyepiece camera""</strong></p>

<p>You can find relatively cheap USB cameras made for imaging, some are less than $100. With one of those, you could achieve focus relatively easy. Example:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.telescope.com/Astrophotography/Astrophotography-Cameras/Orion-StarShoot-USB-Eyepiece-Camera-II/pc/-1/c/4/sc/58/p/102083.uts"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.telescope.com/Astrophotography/Astrophotography-Cameras/Orion-StarShoot-USB-Eyepiece-Camera-II/pc/-1/c/4/sc/58/p/102083.uts</a></p>

<p>Would not offer the same performance like a DSLR, but it's better than nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Use a telescope made for imaging</strong></p>

<p>Visual scopes, like a small newtonian, are not really that great for photography, for a variety of reasons. A dedicated astrograph would always work better. There are many Cassegrain systems out there made specifically for imaging, some are relatively inexpensive (not much more expensive than a DSLR).</p>

<p>In many cases, you need very long exposure, and you need to track the sky while the shutter is open. Many such scopes come with a tracking mount, or are made to be installed on a tracking mount. That would make it very easy to do tracking well.</p>

<p>It would be very hard to do tracking with other kinds of scopes (tracking platforms for dobsonians do exist, but are not very common).</p>

<p><strong>Move the primary mirror up</strong></p>

<p>Think about it - if you move the primary mirror up in its cell, the focal plane will stick out. This is a way to gain back focus only if you know what you're doing. Additional spacers in the primary mirror cell could do it. Modifying the cell is also doable.</p>

<p>Beware, you could ruin the scope if you make a mistake. Also, if the secondary mirror is too small to begin with, you'll increase the amount of clipping.</p>

<p><strong>Afocal photography</strong></p>

<p>Put the eyepiece in the scope, just like for a normal visual observation. Now put the camera at the eyepiece and move it around until you capture the image. Click the shutter. This is called afocal photography.</p>

<p>You'll need a camera mount, that will attach to the focuser, holding the camera at the eyepiece. Something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.telescope.com/Astrophotography/Astrophotography-Accessories/Orion-SteadyPix-Deluxe-Camera-Mount/pc/-1/c/4/sc/61/p/5338.uts"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.telescope.com/Astrophotography/Astrophotography-Accessories/Orion-SteadyPix-Deluxe-Camera-Mount/pc/-1/c/4/sc/61/p/5338.uts</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that your camera is very likely too heavy for this trick to work. Also, afocal is usually the lowest quality of all techniques, and rarely works well enough.</p>

<p>(There are special adapters that go on the eyepiece on one end, and thread into the camera lens like a filter on the other end. These would work better, but are hard to find, only a few eyepieces support them, and your camera is too heavy anyway.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Keep in mind that your scope has a 1.25"" focuser. Even if you do get the sensor in focus, the small size of the focuser will clip the image; you will only be able to use the central part of the sensor. It is recommended to use 2"" focusers for prime focus imaging with large sensors.</p>

<p>Also, your f/4 scope would exhibit strong aberrations at the edge anyway, which would blur the image. For prime focus imaging, longer focal ratios are usually desirable.</p>

<p>All in all, your scope and your camera are mismatched. You have a pretty good camera, but a very small scope that is not made for imaging. Either use a dedicated astrograph with that camera, or keep the scope and use a cheap USB ""eyepiece camera"".</p>

"Could someone explain RA/dec in simple terms?","5196","","<p>The equatorial coordinate system isn't too complicated. However, for people new to this, it seems rather intimidating at first.</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to explain it?</p>
","<p><strong>A system projected into the sky</strong></p>

<p>Pretend all the stars are painted on the inside of a large ball, and you are at the center of the ball. The imagined ball is called the Celestial Sphere. If the Earth wasn't blocking the lower half of your view, and the Sun wasn't making the blue sky so bright, you would be able to look at the stars in any direction.</p>

<p>First, the rotation of the Earth causes the imagined ball of stars to appear to move around the sky. If you lay on your back, (in the norther hemisphere,) with your head to the north, the stars slowly slide by from left to right. There are two points however, where the stars don't appear to move: These two points are directly above the Earth's north and south poles. These two points, projected out into the sky are labeled the North, and South, Celestial Poles.</p>

<p>Next, the Earth's equator is projected out into the sky and labeled the Celestial Equator.</p>

<p>Finally, sorting out the east-west positioning, (ie left-right if you lay on your back, head to the north), requires an arbitrary selection: There are an infinite number of circles one can imagine drawing on the sky. (For example, small circles the size of the moon, and also many much bigger circles.) The largest circle you can draw is called a ""great circle"", from geometry. Point at the North Celestial Pole, (way above and behind your head if you face south in the northern hemisphere,) and draw a line straight south to the horizon, then down below your feet through the South celestial pole and back up to the North Celestial Pole. You have just drawn one Great Circle, through the Celestial Poles, all the way around the Celestial Sphere.</p>

<p>But that Great Circle is just one of an infinite number of similar ones. One could start at the North Celestial Pole and draw a Great Circle a little to the left or the right. So astronomers have chosen one specific Great Circle and labeled one side of that circle as ""zero degrees"" -- or, ""we will start measuring angles from here.""</p>

<p><strong>So how do we use this system?</strong></p>

<p>""right ascension"" is measured rightward, (from your left to your right if you face south in the northern hemisphere,) from the zero-degrees half of that chosen great circle. So given a right ascension, one can find the corresponding half of a great circle. For a given right ascension, you have half of circle selected from the North Celestial Pole, to the South Celestial Pole. (This is called a line of equal longitude.)</p>

<p>""declination"" is measured from the Celestial Equator. The Celestial Equator cuts through the middle of your line of longitude. From the Celestial Equator it is 90° northward(+) to the North Celestial Pole, and 90° southward(-) to the South Celestial Pole. So we can measure from +90° (northward) to -90° (southward) along that line of longitude, from the Celestial Equator. (Don't be confused by ""positive declinations""; 45° of declination is northward from the Celestial Equator.)</p>

<p>Notice that the system does not depend on where you are standing on Earth, nor on the time of day. If you have a Right Ascension and a Declination, you have an unambiguous spot specified on the Celestial Sphere. The system is actually very simple, but the rotation (time of day) of the Earth, and where you are geographically located needs to also be figured in.</p>

<p><strong>What's over my head right now?</strong></p>

<p>Face south, (if you're in the northern hemisphere.) What is your latitude -- geographically, how far north are you from the Earth's equator? If you are 40° north, then Celestial declination of 40° north is directly over your head. Declination of 50° is 10° further northward from directly over your head, etc. But for each declination, you have a circle of points in the sky that all have that same declination.  The circle is centered around the celestial poles.  As the earth turns it appears to slowly rotate overhead. Note: If you are at the equator, this circle is just the celestial equator, and it is a great circle.  As you approach either pole, the circle will get smaller.  The poles, this circle collapses to a point.  </p>

<p>Right ascension you simply have to look up. That arbitrarily chosen, zero-degree line, appears to spin around the sky every day at the Earth rotates. Also, over the course of a year, the Earth's orbit about the sun makes an extra apparent turn of the sky. (What is overhead mid-winter, is directly under your feet mid-summer!) So there's an offset -- what right ascension is overhead <strong>on this date</strong> at midnight, and how far (in hours) are we from midnight right now? Combining those two you can figure out what Right Ascension is over head at any time, on any date.</p>

"Why is iron responsible for causing a supernova?","5173","","<p>Why is the element iron responsible for supernova? Can any star create more element than iron within the span of its life?</p>

<p>I understand that when star dies due to supernova, other elements are created (Gold and other 92 elements) due to more heat generated than required not only for fusion of Iron element but also for the fusion of higher element with each other.</p>
","<p>Your question is a bit oversimplified because there are many types of supernovae based on the size and configuration of the star. But I can answer your question about <em>""why iron""</em> by considering what keeps a star from exploding in the first place.</p>

<p>In the simplest terms of star formation, when material from an interstellar nebula starts to collapse under its own gravity, the pressure and temperatures involved will become great enough to eventually start fusing hydrogen into helium (it's a bit more complicated than that, but I'm speaking in generalities). If you were to consider the helium atoms created by that process, you'll notice that each helium atom weighs just a bit <em>less</em> than the two hydrogen atoms that formed it. That bit of extra mass is given off as energy which is produced in great quantities as the hydrogen continues to be fused into helium.</p>

<p>During the star's ""main sequence"", the release of energy by the hydrogen-helium fusion helps counteract the weight of the star's gasses pushing inward. Material presses in; energy pushes out in perfect balance. This balance of gravity and energy output continues until the star uses up most of its hydrogen. </p>

<p>It's at this this point (when there is no hydrogen to fuse into helium) that the fusion reaction stops and gravity will resume to collapse the star further. As this star collapses, it will quickly become denser and hotter until the temperature and pressures of the interior are great enough to start fusing helium into heavier elements&hellip; and the process continues.</p>

<p><strong>That is, until the star starts fusing elements into iron&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>The fusion into iron is the first element that does <strong><em>not</em></strong> create more energy than it takes to produce. The effect is that there is no net energy being produced to counteract the gravity pushing inward. So the outer layers will quickly collapse into a much denser and smaller ball causing the remaining star material to undergo fusion all at once, causing the supernova.</p>

<p>So, in that sense, <strong>iron is not the <em>cause</em> of the supernova,</strong> but its presence marks the inevitable end of this star's life cycle&hellip; in this particular scenario. </p>

<p>But understand that this is an oversimplification to illustrate the process you asked about. There are many other sequences of a star's life cycle. Our sun, for example, does not have sufficient mass to keep collapsing down with sufficient pressures to fuse heavier elements into iron. Without getting into <em>other</em> pathways for the production of heavy elements (even in smaller stars like our sun) &mdash; once our sun starts creating carbon and oxygen, the fuel starts to run out and the core will simply collapse and rebound as it swells up into a red giant, before losing its outer layers as a planetary nebula while the core shrinks to become a white dwarf (and eventually cooling into a black dwarf). </p>

"How to calculate the temperature of a star","5074","","<p>I need a way to calculate the effective temperature (surface temperature) of a star for a stellar model. I need something in the form Te=....</p>

<li>the composition of particles (eg H 90%, He 8% etc)</li>

<li>mp=average mass of a particle=1,7E-027</li>
<li>M=total mass of the body=2E30</li>
<li>r=radius of the body=700000000</li>

<p>I'm using this equation to estimate the core temperature :</p>

<p><code>(G*mp*M)/(r*(3/2)*k)</code> </p>

<p><code>4*PI*(r^2)*s*(Te^4)</code> </p>

","<p>Currently Polaris is at a declination of a bit over 89 degrees, which means that no one south of 1 degree south latitude can see Polaris. That's almost all of the Southern hemisphere, let alone the South Pole.</p>

<p>Polaris won't be the North Star forever, thanks to axial precession. In about 13000 years or so, Polaris will have a declination of about 46 degrees or so (twice the 23 degree axial tilt). Polaris will thus be visible in 13000 years or so as a wintertime star to all of Africa, all of Australia, and most of South America, but none of Antarctica.</p>

<p>After millions of years, proper motion may make Polaris visible over Antarctica. But then again, being a yellow supergiant, its unlikely that Polaris will be visible anywhere (without a telescope). It will instead be dead.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>My understanding is that the Earth's axis points in the same direction in space during its entire orbit around the sun. And this is what causes our seasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second statement is correct. The axial tilt is the primary driver of the seasons.</p>

<p>The first statement is not exactly correct. There is a small but persistent change in the orientation of the Earth's axis. The change over the course of a year is small. The change over the course of 13,000 years is large. In 13,000 years the Earth's axis will be tilted by about 47 degrees compared to the current orientation. In yet another 13,000 years the Earth will be oriented very similarly to how it is oriented now. I'll write more about this later.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My question is why doesn't the axis follow the orbital path (kind of like a car driving around a circle)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not a good mental model. The only contact between your car and the ground are the bottoms of the four wheels on your car. The forces at these four small contact areas are what change your car's orientation and change your car's velocity vector. This means that the torque on your car as you turn the steering wheel and the centripetal force on your car that makes your care negotiate a turn are intimately connected. Turn the steering wheel gently and the heavy front end of your car follows suit. Assuming a gentle turn, the light rear end of you car soon follows suit. If you turn too hard, your car starts to skid instead of turn. Turn even harder yet and you risk having your car flip and roll. The motion of your car depends on that intimate coupling between force and torque.</p>

<p>Gravitation doesn't work like that. It instead acts on each and every bit of the Earth, all together, all at once, all the time. There is a slight variation in the gravitationally-induced acceleration across the Earth due to variations in distance to the Moon (or Sun), but these variations are small. The net gravitational force on the Earth is very much decoupled from the small net gravity gradient torque on the Earth.</p>

<p>The principal result of the gravity gradient torque exerted by the Moon and the Sun on the Earth is a very slow but large precession of the Earth's rotation axis (for more, read this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession"">wikipedia article on axial precession</a>). This precession makes the Earth's rotation axis rotate about the normal to the ecliptic at a rate of one revolution per 25772 years. There are lesser effects collectively called nutations and polar motion that result from gravity gradient torque. These lesser effects are much, much smaller in magnitude but have much, much shorter periods. The largest of these lesser effects results from the 18.61 year cyclical variations in the lunar node. Even this largest component of nutation is small, two orders of magnitude smaller than the large but slow precession.</p>

","<p>Well, there's two things we'll need for this: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"">apparent magnitude</a> (the brightness that an object appears to have) and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude"">absolute magnitude</a> (the actual brightness an object has). Both of these scales are logarithmic, with brighter objects being lower and dimmer objects being higher. Astronomers have determined that the Sun's absolute magnitude is 4.83. Knowing this, we can find the apparent magnitude of the Sun from Proxima Centauri's location. Apparent and absolute magnitudes are related by the equation:</p>

<p>$$M = m - 5 (\log_{10}{d}-1)$$</p>

<p>Where $M$ is the absolute magnitude, $m$ is the apparent magnitude, and $d$ is the distance, in parsecs. Astronomers have determined that Proxima Centauri is 1.3 parsecs from us. So the apparent magnitude can be determined as:</p>

<p>$$m = 4.83 + 5(\log_{10}{1.3}-1) ≈ +0.4$$</p>

<p>As made clear in this <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1947PASP...59..232W"">paper</a>, most humans can see objects with apparent magnitudes as dim as $5$ without using tools. So yes, it is certainly visible, and would be quite bright. It is between Procyon and Achernar, the 9th and 10th brightest star on Earth's night sky.</p>

<p>For a comparison, Proxima Centauri has an apparent magnitude of $+11.13$ from Earth's perspective. If we want to compare the two, we could use this formula:</p>

<p>$$v_b = 10^{0.4 x} = 10^{0.4×(11.13-0.4)} \approx 19588$$</p>

<p>The takeaway is that NASAs WISE mission would have probably spotted a planet of at least 50 Earth masses in the proposed orbit and that none of our current surveys would have had a chance to find one below 20 earth masses in most of its orbit.  They put the planets temperature at 47K due to residual heat from formation; which would make is 1000x brighter in infrared than it is in visible light reflected from the sun.  </p>

<p>It should however be within reach of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Synoptic_Survey_Telescope"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LSST</a> once it is completed (first light 2019, normal operations beginning 2022); so the question should be resolved within a few more years even if its far enough from Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit that their search with the Subaru telescope comes out empty.</p>

<p><strong>My original attempt to handwave an estimate of detectability is below.</strong>
The <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22/meta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paper</a> gives potential orbital parameters of $400-1500~\textrm{AU}$ for the semi major axis, and $200-300~\textrm{AU}$ for perihelion. Since the paper doesn't give a most-likely case for orbital parameters, I'm going to go with the extreme case that makes it most difficult to find. Taking the most eccentric possible values from that gives an orbit with a $1500~\textrm{AU}$ semi-major axis and a $200~\textrm{AU}$ perihelion has a $2800~\textrm{AU}$ aphelion.</p>

<p>To calculate the brightness of an object shining with reflected light, the proper scaling factor is not a $1/r^2$ falloff as could be naively assumed.  That is correct for an object radiating its own light; but not for one shining by reflected light; for that case the same $1/r^4$ scaling as in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radar return</a> is appropriate. That this is the correct scaling factor to use can be sanity checked based on the fact that despite being similar in size, Neptune is $\sim 6x$ dimmer than Uranus despite being only $50\%$ farther away: $1/r^4$ scaling gives a $5x$ dimmer factor vs $2.25$ for $1/r^2$.</p>

<p>Using that gives a dimming of 2400x at $210~\textrm{AU}\;.$ That puts us down $8.5$ magnitudes down from Neptune at perihelion or $16.5$ magnitude.  $500~\textrm{AU}$ gets us to $20$th magnitude, while a $2800~\textrm{AU}$ aphelion dims reflected light down by nearly $20$ magnitudes to $28$ magnitude. That's equivalent to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">faintest stars visible from an 8 meter telescope</a>; making its non-discovery much less surprising.</p>

<p>This is something of a fuzzy boundary in both directions. Residual energy from formation/radioactive material in its core will be giving it some innate luminosity; at extreme distances this might be brighter than reflected light. I don't know how to estimate this. It's also possible that the extreme cold of the Oort Cloud may have frozen its atmosphere out. If that happened, its diameter would be much smaller and the reduction in reflecting surface could dim it another order of magnitude or two.</p>

<p>Not knowing what sort of adjustment to make here, I'm going to assume the two factors cancel out completely and leave the original assumptions that it reflects as much light as Neptune and reflective light is the dominant source of illumination for the remainder of my calculations.</p>

<p>For reference, data from NASA's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_%28hypothetical_star%29#Past.2C_current.2C_and_pending_searches_for_Nemesis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WISE</a> experiment has ruled out a Saturn-sized body within $10,000~\textrm{AU}$ of the sun.</p>

<p><strong>It's also likely too faint to have been detected via proper motion; although if we can pin its orbit down tightly Hubble could confirm its motion.</strong></p>

<p>Orbital eccentricity can be calculated as:</p>

<p>$$e = \frac{r_\textrm{max} - r_\textrm{min}}{2a}$$</p>

<p>Plugging in the numbers gives:</p>

<p>$$e = \frac{2800~\textrm{AU} - 200~\textrm{AU}}{2\cdot 1500~\textrm{AU}} = 0.867$$</p>

<p>Plugging $200~\textrm{AU}$ and $e = 0.867$ into a <a href=""http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~newhouse/p210/orbits/#bottom"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cometary orbit calculator</a> gives a $58,000$ year orbit.</p>

<p>While that gives an average proper motion of $ 22~\textrm{arc-seconds/year}\;,$ because the orbit is highly eccentric its actual proper motion varies greatly, but it spends a majority of its time far from the sun where its values are at a minimum.</p>

<p>Kepler's laws tell us that the <a href=""http://people.bridgewater.edu/~rbowman/ISAW/KeplerCalc.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">velocity at aphelion</a> is given by:</p>

<p>$$v_a^2 = \frac{ 8.871 \times 10^8 }{ a }  \frac{ 1 - e }{ 1 + e }$$</p>

<p>where $v_a$ is the aphelion velocity in $\mathrm{m/s}\;,$ $a$ is the semi-major axis in $\mathrm{AU},$ and $e$ is orbital eccentricity.</p>

<p>$$v_a = \sqrt{\frac{ 8.871 \times 10^8 }{ 1500 } \cdot \frac{ 1 - 0.867 }{ 1 + 0.867 }} = 205~\mathrm{m/s}\;.$$</p>

<p>To calculate the proper motion we first need to convert the velocity into units of $\textrm{AU/year}:$</p>

<p>$$205 \mathrm{\frac{m}{s}}\;  \mathrm{\frac{3600 s}{1 h}} \cdot \mathrm{\frac{24 h}{1 d}} \cdot \mathrm{\frac{365 d}{1 y}} \cdot \mathrm{\frac{1\; AU}{1.5 \times 10^{11}m}} = 0.043~\mathrm{\frac{AU}{year}}$$</p>

<p>To get proper motion from this, create a triangle with a hypotenuse of $2800~\textrm{AU}$ and a short side of $0.043~\textrm{AU}$ and then use trigonometry to get the narrow angle.</p>

<p>I was reading an <a href=""http://www.iflscience.com/space/seeking-source-those-gravitational-waves"">article</a> today and I thought I'd share it here; It's basically saying that without a third detector we can't triangulate the signal. 
Some scientists tried ways to observe the light of the event directly after the observations of the wave but they couldn't detect the merger simply because it's too far away or too faint to be observed with our current technology.</p>
","<p>No more than the observation of light waves disproves quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Light has properties of both a particle and a wave. At low energies, the particle nature of light is hard to detect: radio waves are made of photons, but individual radio wave photons are pretty hard to detect. I'm not sure that we have directly detected individual photons with energies below the infrared band. </p>

<p>Gravitational waves (probably) also have both a wave and a particle nature. The gravitational field is probably quantised. But at the frequencies and sensitivity at which LIGO operates, individual quanta cannot be measured. So this detection does not prove the ascendency of GR over QM.</p>

"Why doesn't the moon twinkle?","4838","","<p>Stars twinkle because their light has to squeeze through several different layers of the Earth's atmosphere. So why doesn't the moon twinkle as well?</p>
","<p>The first handful of hits on Google actually return incomplete and even wrong answers (e.g. ""Because the Moon is much brighter"" which is plain wrong, and ""Because the Moon is closer"" which is incomplete [see below]). So here's the answer:</p>

<p>As you mention, when light enters our atmosphere, it goes through several parcels of gas with varying density, temperature, pressure, and humidity. These differences make the refractive index of the parcels different, and since they move around (the scientific term for air moving around is ""wind""), the light rays take slightly different paths through the atmosphere.</p>

<strong>Stars are point sources</strong>

<p>Stars are immensely far away, effectively making them point sources. When you look at a point source through the atmosphere, the different paths taken from one moment to another makes it ""jump around"" — i.e. it twinkles (or <em>scintillates</em>).</p>

<p>The region in which the point source jumps around spans an angle of the order of an arcsecond. If you take a picture of a star, then during the exposure time, the star has jumped around everywhere inside this region, and thus it's no longer a point, but a ""disk"".</p>

<strong>…the Moon is not</strong>

<p>The same is true for the Moon, but since the Moon (as seen from Earth) is much larger (roughly 2000 times larger, to be specific) than this ""seeing disk"" as it's called, you simply don't notice it. However, if you are observing details on the Moon through a telescope, then the seeing puts a limit on how fine details you can see. </p>

<p>The same is even true for planets. The planets you can see with the naked eye span from several arcsec up to almost an arcmin. Although they <em>look</em> like point sources (because the resolution of the human eye is roughly 1 arcmin), they aren't, and you will notice that they don't twinkle (unless they're near the horizon where their light goes through a thicker layer of atmosphere).</p>

<p>The image below may help understanding why you see the twinkling of a star, but not of the Moon (greatly exaggerated):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wp9Ct.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wp9Ct.png"" alt=""twinkle""></a></p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Due to the comments below, I added the following paragraph:</p>

<strong>Neither absolute size, nor distance is important in itself. Only the ratio is.</strong>

<p>As described above, what makes a light source twinkle depends on its <em>apparent</em> size compared to the seeing $s$, i.e. its <em>angular diameter</em> $\delta$ defined by the ratio between its absolute diameter $d$ and its distance $D$ from Earth:
$$
\delta = 2 \arctan \left( \frac{d}{2D} \right)
\simeq \frac{d}{D}\,\,\,\mathrm{for\,small\,angles}
$$</p>

<p>If $\delta \lesssim s$, the object twinkles. If it's larger, it doesn't.</p>

<p>Hence, saying that the Moon doesn't twinkle because it's close is an incomplete answer, since for instance a powerful laser 400 km from Earth — i.e. 1000 times <em>closer</em> than the Moon — would still twinkle because it's small. Or vice versa, the Moon <em>would</em> twinkle even at the distance it is, if it were just 2000 times smaller.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, to achieve good images with a telescope you not only want to put it at a remote site (to avoid light pollution), but also — to minimize the seeing — at high altitudes (to have less air) and at particularly dry regions (to have less humidity). Alternatively you can just put it in space.</p>

"How did Kepler ""guess"" his third law from data?","4682","","<p>It is amazing that Kepler determined his three laws by looking at data, without a calculator and using only pen and paper. It is conceivable how he proved his laws described the data after he had already conjectured them, but what I do not understand is how he guessed them in the first place. </p>

<p>I will focus in particular on Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. </p>

<p>I assume that Kepler was working with data about the planets only, plus our own moon, and the sun. I make this assumption because I don't think Kepler had data about other moons, comets, or asteroids, which had not been observed by telescope yet. If this is true, knowing that Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto were not yet discovered when Kepler was alive, this means Kepler had less than 9 data points to work with.</p>

<p>My friend claims that it is totally concievably how Kepler guessed this relationship (although he provides no method of how Kepler might have done it), and also that Kepler's observations are ""not that hard"".  As a challenge, I gave my friend a data table with one column labeled $x$, the other $y$, and 9 coordinates $(x,y)$ which fit the relationship $x^4=y^3$. I said ""please find the relationship between $x$ and $y$"", and as you might expect he failed to do so. </p>

<p>Please explain to me how in the world did Kepler guess this relationship working with so few data points. And if my assumption that the number of data points Kepler had at his disposal is small, is wrong, then I still think its quite difficult to guess this relationship without a calculator. </p>
","<p>Kepler's third law is trivial (in my opinion) compared to his first law. I am quite impressed that he was able to deduce that the orbits were ellipses. To get that, he had to go back and forth plotting Mars' direction from Earth and Earth's direction from Mars. He knew the length of both planets' years, so observations taken one Mars year apart would differ only because Earth had moved.</p>

<p>But maybe not so trivial. He published his first two laws in 1609. The third law didn't come along until ten years later, in 1619. With ten years to work on it, even the most obscure relationship will eventually be found.</p>

<p>To discover a ratio-of-powers relationship, plot the logarithms of the numbers. In your example with $x^4 = y^3$, the logs would plot on a straight line with a slope of $3/4$.</p>

<p>The timing is right. Napier published his book on logarithms in 1614. Kepler may have on a whim applied this shiny new mathematical tool to his crusty old data.</p>

<p>The major hurdle was that at the time there were only six known planets, so he didn't have an abundance of data points, and the ones he had were by no means precise.</p>

<p>Kepler's other problem is that none of his laws made any sense to him. They fit the data, but he had no idea why. He didn't have Newton's laws of motion to work from, he had no understanding of force, momentum, angular momentum, and certainly not gravity. So far as he knew, the planets moved the way they did because God decreed it, and angels were tasked with pushing the planets along their orbits. The outer planets moved slower because they were being pushed by lesser angels.</p>

","<p>The simple answer is that it does, but it's not bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Earth's atmosphere scatters the moon light just like sunlight.  </p>

<p>The full moon (like the sun) fills about 1/2 of 1 degree of the sky, the entire sky being 180 degrees, give or take, so the full moon fills less than 1 part in 100,000 of the night sky, so there simply isn't enough blue light to be visible over the brighter stars even with the brightest full moon. Our eyes are very good at seeing variations in brightness, but not that good. . . . and, for what it's worth, the night sky has always appeared to have a dark bluish tint to me, but that might just be my brain playing tricks on me because logically I know it's there.

"Why do stars explode?","4599","","<p>I always hear the narrator of documentaries say that a star exploded because it ran out of fuel.
Usually things explode when they have too much fuel, not when they run out of fuel.
Please explain...</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> </p>

<p>A tiny fraction of the gravitational potential energy released by the very rapid collapse of the inert iron core gets transferred to the outer layers and this is sufficient to power the observed explosion.</p>

<p><strong>In more detail:</strong></p>

<p>Consider the energetics of an idealised model star. It has a ""core"" of mass $M$ and initial radius $R_0$ and an outer envelope of mass $m$ and radius $r$.</p>

<p>Now suppose the core collapses to a much smaller radius $R \ll R_0$ on such a short timescale that it decouples from the envelope. The amount of gravitational potential energy released will​ be $\sim GM^2/R$.</p>

<p>A fraction of this released energy can be transferred to the envelope in the form of outward moving shocks and radiation. If the transferred energy exceeds the gravitational binding energy of the envelope $\sim Gm^2/r$ then the envelope can be blown into space.</p>

<p>In an exploding star (a type II core collapse supernovae) $R_0\sim 10^4$ km, $R\sim 10$ km and $r \sim 10^8$ km. The core mass is $M \sim 1.2M_{\odot}$ and  the envelope mass is $m \sim 10M_{\odot}$. The dense core is mostly made of iron and supported by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure"" rel=""noreferrer"">electron degeneracy pressure</a>. The star is said to have ""run out of fuel"" because fusion reactions with iron nuclei do not release significant amounts of energy.</p>

<p>The collapse is triggered because nuclear burning continues around the core and so the core mass is gradually increased and as it does so it gradually <em>shrinks</em> (a peculiarity of structures supported by degeneracy pressure), the density increases and then an instability is introduced either by electron capture reactions or photodisintegration of iron nuclei. Either way, electrons (which are what is providing the support for the core) are mopped up by protons to form neutrons and the core collapses on a free fall timescale of $\sim 1$ s!</p>

<p>The collapse is halted by the strong nuclear force and neutron degeneracy pressure. The core bounces; a shock wave travels outwards; most of the gravitational energy is stored in neutrinos and a fraction of this is transferred to the shock before the neutrinos escape, driving away the outer envelope. An excellent descriptive account of this and the previous paragraph can be read in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0601261.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Woosley &amp; Janka (2005)</a>.</p>

<p>Putting in some numbers.
$$GM^2/R = 4\times 10^{46}\ {\rm J}$$
$$Gm^2/r = 3\times 10^{44}\ {\rm J}$$</p>

<p>So one only needs to transfer of order 1% of the collapsing core's released potential energy to the envelope in order to drive the supernova explosion. This is actually not yet understood in detail, though somehow supernovae find a way to do it.</p>

<p><strong>A key point</strong> is that the rapid collapse takes place <em>only</em> in the core of the star. If the entire star collapsed as one, then most of the gravitational potential energy would escape as radiation and neutrinos and there would be insufficient energy even to reverse the collapse. In the <em>core</em> collapse model, most (90%+) of the released gravitational energy <em>is</em> lost as neutrinos, but what remains is still easily sufficient to unbind the uncollapsed <em>envelope</em>. The collapsed core remains bound and becomes either a neutron star or black hole.</p>

<p>A second way to cause a star (a white dwarf) to explode is a thermonuclear reaction. If the carbon and oxygen can be ignited in nuclear fusion reactions then enough energy is released to exceed the gravitational binding energy of the white dwarf. These are type Ia supernovae.</p>

<p>Observing the planets orbit of the Sun they all seem relatively planar and roughly all orbit along the same plane. </p>

<p>Is this due to the way that our Solar system was formed or is this a physical phenomena observed in other systems?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bjntY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>In the protostar stage of the Sun, it was surrounded by a (spinning) gas cloud. This cloud behaved like a fluid (well, a gas <em>is</em> a fluid), so it flattened out into an accretion disk due to conservation of angular momentum. The planets eventually formed from the dust/gas in the disk from compression of the dust in the disk. This process won't end up moving the dust out of the plane (all the vertical force of gravity is <em>toward</em> the disk), so the final planet is in the plane too.</p>

<p>Why does an accretion disk have to be flat? Well, firstly, let's imagine the protostar and gas cloud before the accretion disk formed. Usually such a setup will have particles spinning in mostly one direction. The ones spinning in retrograde orbits will end up reversing themselves due to collisions.</p>

<p>In this gas sphere, there will be an equal number of particles with positive and negative vertical velocities (at a given point in time; due to rotation the velocity signs will flip). From collisions, eventually these will all become zero.</p>

<p>A particle revolving around a planet will <em>always</em> revolve such that the projection on the planet is a great circle.

If so, would it only be able to fuse for a short time before running out of fuel, or would it turn into a full-fledged star?</p>
","<p>The answer to your question is both yes and no, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Two white dwarfs colliding would likely yield a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova#Double_degenerate_progenitors"" rel=""noreferrer"">Type Ia supernova</a>, assuming the combined mass exceeded the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_Limit"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chandrasekhar limit</a> ($\sim1.4$ solar masses). The unstable object resulting from the collision could not be supported by electron degeneracy pressure; when the temperature rises rapidly due to the collision, there is nothing to stop it (compare this to thermal pressure in a ""normal"" star, which can make the star expand or contract to compensate for changes in temperature).</p>

<p>The rise in temperature triggers fusion, which then increases the temperature, which triggers more fusion . . . and so on and so on, in a <em>very</em> short time span. This is the same process, more or less, as in an accretion-powered type Ia supernova. The resulting explosion destroys the object, ejecting matter into space.</p>

<p>As with normal Type Ia supernovae, this sort of collision would likely happen in a binary system, with two white dwarfs in close orbits losing energy to gravitational waves and spiraling in (the odds of two unrelated white dwarfs colliding is very, very low). I'm not sure how luminous this event would be in the gravitational wave spectrum; likely fainter than a neutron star-neutron star inspiral but still strong. The speeds of the components could be quite fast, meaning that a lot of energy would be released in the collision.</p>

<p>Things are slightly more complicated if the combined mass is less than the Chandrasekhar limit. An example system that is predicted to undergo a collision is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDSS_J0106-1000"" rel=""noreferrer"">SDSS J010657.39-100003.3</a>. The total mass of the two white dwarfs is $\sim0.6$ solar masses, certainly below the limit. In roughly 37 million years (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/413/1/L101/1747379"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kilic et al.

Similar scenarios could play out in other systems.</p>

<p>This sort of a star would not be a ""normal"" star in the sense that it wouldn't truly be on the main sequence - just a bit below it. It would be an O- or B- type subdwarf, less luminous than main sequence stars of the same spectral type. I saw a couple of articles on these objects claiming that they would be stars just like the Sun - it's not true! Given that white dwarfs are highly depleted in hydrogen - remember, they are the degenerate cores of old stars - there can be virtually no hydrogen burning, even in a shell. Core helium burning is the only option.</p>

<p>$$
\text{magnification} = \frac{\text{focal length of telescope}}{\text{focal length of eye-piece}} \qquad (1)

$$</p>

<p>However, where does the formula $(1)$ come from? Why is the magnification affected by the focal length of the <em>telescope and eye piece</em>?</p>

<p>(I am using a Newtonian telescope if it matters.)</p>
","<p>The objective lens of a telescope forms an real image of the night sky, the size of that image is in proportion to the focal length of the objective lens. The reason for this is simple geometry: If two stars are 1 arcminute apart, and the lens is forming an image of them, then the further the image is from the lens, the further apart the images of the two stars will be.</p>

<p>The eyepiece then magnifies the image. When using a lens to magnify you put the object at (or near) the focal distance from the lens. The shorter the focal length of the eyepiece, the closer you can get to the object and so the larger it appears. All this is a round about way of saying the the magnification of a lens is inversely proportional to the focal length. </p>

<p>In the case of a telescope, the ""object"" being magnified is the image formed by the objective lens. Putting this together: the apparent size of the image is directly proportional to the focal length of the objective lens, and inversely proportional to the focal length of the eyepiece, and the constant of proportionality is 1 (just imagine that both the objective and eyepiece have the same focal length). So 
$$\mathrm{Mag} = \frac{L_o}{L_e}.$$</p>

<p>Another proof to support this is the presence of numerous binary asteroids that orbit each other around a common center of mass, which requires gravitational attraction.</p>

"How many arms does the Milky Way galaxy have?","4364","","<p>How many arms does the Milky Way galaxy have and how is it determined? </p>
","<p>This is actually a really, really tough question.</p>

<p>Look at this diagram:</p>

<p><a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Milky_Way_Arms.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Milky_Way_Arms.svg"" alt=""""></a>

<sup>Purple: Norma Arm and Outer Arm.</sup>
<br>
<sup>Green: Scutum-Centaurus Arm</sup>
<br>
<sup>Pink: Carina-Sagittarius Arm</sup>
<br>
<sup>Cyan: 3 kpc Arm and Perseus Arm</sup></p>

<p>So we can slightly modify this picture by saying that there are four arms, and calling them by the following names:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Arm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Norma-Outer Arm</a></strong></p>

<p>This arm has one end at the center of the Milky Way; this end is called the Norma Arm. It's actually quite small. However, as you continue outward along the lanes of gas, dust and stars, the Norma Arm becomes the - wait for it - <em>Outer</em> Arm.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutum%E2%80%93Centaurus_Arm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scutum-Centaurus/Crux-Scutum Arm</a></strong></p>

<p>This arm also emanates from the center (well, duh!) and is distinguished by <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.1823v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">large numbers of clusters of red supergiants</a> near the center (where it is referred to as the Scutum Arm) of the Milky Way. The Scutum-Sagittarius Arm is one of the Milky Way's two major arms.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina%E2%80%93Sagittarius_Arm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Carina-Sagittarius Arm</a></strong></p>

<p>The defining feature of this arm is that is has many <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">H II regions</a>, where ionized gas is plentiful. It is though that stars can form there. However, H II regions are also present in many other parts of the galaxy. <a href=""http://www.astro.wisc.edu/sirtf/Churchwell_2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope</a> seem to support these theories and prior observations.</p>

<p>The Spitzer results are, I think, very important for understanding our galaxy and the things in it. It confirmed the existence of all four arms, but also confirmed that the Norma-Outer Arm and Sagittarius Arm are relatively minor compared to the other two.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_3_kpc_Arm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Near</a>/<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_3_kpc_Arm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Far 3 kpc Arm</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_Arm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Perseus Arm</a></strong></p>

<p>The Near and Far 3 kpc Arms (which really are just one arm) are very close to the galactic center - about 3,000 parsecs (hence the name). The Far Arm was <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.1752v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">only discovered recently</a>, while the Near Arm was first observed about 50 years ago. These two mini-arms are expanding outward at an enormous rate. The combined 3 kpc Arm then becomes the Perseus Arm, which extends out to about 3.5 times the distance from the center of the 3 kpc Arm. It is the other major spiral arm of the Milky Way.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, so that's simple enough. The Milky Way has four spiral arms, right? Well . . . sort of. <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/798/2/L27/pdf/2041-8205_798_2_L27.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The discovery of the ""New Outer Arm""</a><sup>1</sup> shook things up, because that would mean that the Norma-Outer Arm reaches nearly <em>all the way around the Milky Way.</em> That's strange and borderline inexplicable. Well, not really. But it's very interesting.</p>

<p>This image gives you a good idea of what it might look like:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/MWspiralstructure_l.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/MWspiralstructure_l.jpg</a></p>

<p>By the way, someone at one point wondered, ""Which are we in?"" That, too, doesn't have a simple answer. Current observations state that we're in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Arm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Orion-Cygnus Arm</a>, a/the midget of the galaxy (depending on whether or not there are other ""mini-arms""). It's tiny - 1.1 kpc wide and 10 kpc long - and is between the Carina-Sagittarius Arm and the Perseus Arm.</p>

<p>Here's what it might look like:</p>

<p>Putting it all together, Robert Hurt made a very famous impression of what the Milky Way might look like:</p>

<p>NASA gives a good explanation of it <a href=""http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080711.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want a good overview on <em>everything</em>, check out <a href=""http://www.galaxymap.org/drupal/node/171"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> blog post, which is reasonably well-sourced. <a href=""http://galaxymap.org/drupal/node/134"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Another post</a> explains the four-arms-vs.-two-arms issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like the proverbial blind men describing an elephant, the two groups of scientists are examining very different parts of the Milky Way. The Spitzer study detected hot objects visible in infrared. The CfA study used radio telescopes which can also detect colder objects such as supernova remnants, very young star formation regions and huge clouds of hydrogen gas. So it seems as though the older established star formation regions are mostly concentrated in two spiral arms, but that the very new star formation regions and the hydrogen clouds from which they form are also developing in two additional arms.</p>
  
  <p>If you were hovering above the Milky Way in a spacecraft using binoculars or a regular optical telescope, you would see two main arms. But if you also had a radio telescope with you, it would detect two more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other group of scientists referred to here <a href=""http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2009-03"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">used the Very Long Baseline Array</a> to image the Milky Way with radio waves; their observations support the four-main arms model.</p>

<p>So at the moment, I think the answer is four, though two arms are more distinct that the other two.</p>

"How much of the Milky Way is visible to the naked eye from earth?","4348","","<p>When we see the Milky Way on a dark night are we seeing the bulk of the galaxy, or just our local arm? How much of the milky way is visible to the naked eye on a dark night?</p>
","<p>At any one time, an average observer can see about 2,500 stars in a clear dark sky. Note that eyesight varies and sharp-eyed individuals may be able to see a half-magnitude dimmer stars than the average eye (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"" rel=""nofollow"">apparent magnitude</a> is a scale in which each integer is $2.51$ ($100^{0.2}$) times brighter or dimmer than the next consecutive integer.) A very dark sky may enable magnitude $+7.5$ or even $+8$ stars to be seen, but in a typical ""dark"" non-urban sky the limit is often $+5.5$ to $+6.5$.</p>

<p>Supernovae can potentially be seen as far as 13 billion light-years (ly) away, essentially from the 'edge' of our observable universe. So, it's not saying much to say that a supernova might be seen across a distance of 100,000 ly.</p>

<p>Some types of supernovae can be over $-22$ in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude"" rel=""nofollow"">absolute magnitude</a> — where absolute magnitude is defined as their apparent magnitude if they were observed from a 32.6 ly distance (to be honest, I'm not sure if supernovae absolute brightness is defined in exactly this same way). By way of comparison, the Sun's abs. mag. is $+4.8$ (lower numbers indicate brighter stars).</p>

<p>Because of the dust and interstellar medium, the possible distance we can see is just a small fraction of the size of the Milky Way. In reality, few stars are bright enough to be seen over 400 ly away. Deneb which has an estimated distance of 2,600 ly (but may be as close as 1,550 ly, the large uncertainty is due to its variation in brightness). Only 6 visible stars are thought to be farther from us than 1,000 ly.</p>

<p>So, to sum up, looking inwards into the Milky Way, our visibility is very restricted to the nearest 1,000–2,000 ly (while the MW disk's radius is 50,000 to 90,000 ly and we're about 27,000 ly on this side of center, but only the brightest stars are visible from more than about 400 ly away.</p>

<p>While looking away, we can see the Andromeda Galaxy (but not its individual stars) which is 2,500,000 ly from us. In other words, most people blame dust for the poor visibility, but that's mostly only relevant for telescopes. For us, our limited eye-sight is the real barrier (not to mention the dearth of really dark skies).</p>

"Why don't we see ""the milky way"" in both directions?","4345","","<p>We're (basically) in the middle of an arm of our galaxy. That is to say, we're sitting in the middle of a dense disc of stars.</p>

<p>It would seem to me that. You should see:</p>

<p>the thick line of the milky way <strong>all around you</strong>, i.e. on that plane, in all four directions.</p>

<p>(Additionally - sure - in the particular direction of the galaxy center, you would additionally see the huge central bulge.)</p>

<p>However: this does <strong>not seem to be the case</strong>: when you look at the milky way from the vicinity of our solar system, you basically see it ""in one direction"".</p>

<p>Quite simply does anyone have any photography of the anti-galactic point?  (Near ""Auriga"" right?)  Does it show any ""milky way band"" going through it?</p>

<p>If not why not? Looking outwards, we are still looking through ~30k lightyears of the dense disk we are sitting in.</p>
","<p>I'll turn <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/18875/why-dont-we-see-the-milky-way-in-both-directions?noredirect=1#comment30269_18875"">my comment</a> into a full answer.</p>

<p>To put it simply, we actually do see the Milky Way all around us, even in the diametrically opposite direction from the galactic core. You can see this in the image below which is a full sky image I took from <a href=""https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010202.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">APOD</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MG313.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MG313.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If you look at the edges of the disk in that image, you're looking at what is actually the edge of our galaxy, opposite in direction from the core. In effect, this is precisely the image you requested because it does contain the part of the sky which contains the anti-core part of the galaxy. It is certainly not as bright, but there are still stars and dust out there. In fact, if you look very closely, you still see lots of dark splotches that mask distance stars and galaxies, indicating there is dust there.</p>

<p>I think the issue you may be having is that you expect many more stars to be within the outer regions of the disk than there actually are. The stellar density profile for our disk is roughly exponential, meaning there are literally exponentially more stars near the core than at the edges. If this means anything to you, the scale length for the exponential radial density profile is ~4 kpc.</p>

<p>To really get a good understanding of the stellar distribution, take a look at <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/523619/pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jurić et al. (2008)</a>. They looked at (~48 million) stars from the SDSS and analyzed the stellar distribution across our galaxy (that is visible to us). You should find figures 10 through 18 of particular interest, however I'll present part of figure 16 here.</p>

<p>This image shows the (logarithmic) density of stars as a function radius from the galactic core. The varying shades of grey indicate varying heights above the galactic plane (numbered in parsecs). The dashed lines are various exponential decay models with differing scale heights. You can see that these star densities, even within the limited radial ranges covered by the SDSS fall off by an order of magnitude! Hopefully this helps you appreciate the significant difference between the core brightness/visibility and that of the galactic edge.</p>

<p>Here's a silver of Andromeda spectacularly demonstrating the falloff: even though galaxy photography tends to suggest to the casual eye an evenly-dense plate:</p>

"The laws of physics through out the universe","4328","","<p>How do we know laws of physics are the same throughout the universe? Intuitively I would say they would vary in two natural ways: the constants in the equations may vary or the math in the equations may vary. As a guess they could change over a long time. What is the furthest radius we can prove from earth, with absolute certainty, that the laws of physics do not vary? I am aware this may not be a radius but a more complex shape that cannot be simply described by a radius.</p>

<p>The nearest answer I can think of for a radius is a guess. And that guess is based on the furthest physics experiment we have done from earth. Which I think is an experiment with mirrors on the moon. Therefore if we assume (I don't know if this assumption is totally 100% reasonable) all physics laws hold because this experiment works. Then the radius is to the moon. This doesn't give an concrete answer for the radius, merely an educated guess.</p>
","<p>Nothing can be proved ""with absolute certainty""; that is not how science works.</p>

<p>We adopt a working hypothesis that the constants of nature are exactly that; both constant in time and space. Then we conduct experiments that attempt to falsify that hypothesis or at least place limits on by how much things might vary.</p>

<p>For reasons that are explained in answers to <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/21721/what-is-the-proof-that-the-universal-constants-g-hbar-ldots-are-real"">this Physics SE question</a> (see also <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/78684/is-it-possible-to-speak-about-changes-in-a-physical-constant-which-is-not-dimens"">this question</a>), only the dimensionless parameters like the fine structure constant can be assessed for their variation - other constants like $G$, $c$ and $h$ are tied up in our system of (measuring) units so we are unable to say whether they are changing or not.</p>

<p>Taking the example of the fine structure constant, observations of absorption lines towards distant quasars put strong limits on by how much this can have varied in space and time (the two are inseparable, since it takes finite time for information to travel to us). So you can find lots of different attempts to do this in the literature - I dug out a few. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.452.4153A"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Albareti et al. (2015)</a> say the variation is less than a couple of parts in a 100,000 out to a redshift of 1 (a lookback time of about 8 billion years or so. Similar constraints exist for experiments carried out in different parts of the solar system. On the other hand, some authors do claim variations of a few parts per million on similar lookback times or in different directions (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612407"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Murphy et al 2008</a>; <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4758"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">King et al. 2012</a>), but these claims are disputed by many, if not most workers in the field.</p>

<p>There is a massive review of this topic by <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5514"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Uzan (2011)</a>, which you could read - this really is a broad question. My summary would be - at the moment there is no convincing evidence for any variation in space and time.</p>

Would we burst through the whole planet, make it only to a core, or just a few km? I know what happens when a meteor lands, but obviously they aren't traveling at the speed of light.</p>

<p>And one similar another question - when a spaceship is traveling at the speed of light, is there a problem with collision with smaller objects? I think you can't avoid millions of rockets in outer space, it would surely damage the spaceship, wouldn't it?</p>
","<p>I don't know about a spaceship, but the XKCD guy wrote an interesting article about what would happen if Earth was hit by a solid asteroid, travelling at various different speeds:

<p>The ship would be a lot smaller than an asteroid, so I think the damage would be a lesser version of these descriptions.  (The most extreme case described is the whole planet being vapourised and even neighbouring planets being affected by the radiation.)</p>

<p>As for the second part of the question - protecting the craft from minor collisions - I admit I have no idea how to work out the kinetic energy from collisions at such high speeds.

<p>I saw some text related to it in the news articles but am not quite sure I understood it. </p>

<p>A simple and clear explanation would be very helpful.</p>
","<p>The star at the center of TRAPPIST-1 is called <a href=""http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=2MASS%20J23062928-0502285"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2MASS J23062928-0502285</a>.  It was discovered by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2MASS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Two Micron All-Sky Survey</a> (2MASS), which imaged the whole sky in the infrared between 1997 and 2001.  This resulted in a catalog of over 300 million objects.  TRAPPIST-1 itself was cataloged in 1999.  The name is actually its coordinates in right ascension and declination.</p>

<p>The planets of the TRAPPIST-1 were discovered by the method of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets#Transit_photometry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">transit photometry</a>.  The way this works is a telescope watches a star for a period of time and records the amount of light coming from the star.  They chart how much light is coming from the star as a function of time, creating a <a href=""https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/timing1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">light curve</a>.  If they see periodic dips in the intensity from the star, there is a high likelihood that that star has a <a href=""http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/transit-photometry.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">planet in orbit around it</a>.  The planet blocks the light from the star every time it passes between us and the star.  This causes the dips in the light curve.  One advantage to this method is that you can scan multiple stars in the same field of view, analyzing them all for planets.</p>

<p>By measuring how long it takes planets to pass in front of the star, how much light it blocks, and how often they orbit, scientists can calculate the masses of these planets and how far away from the star they are by using <a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/measuring-the-mass-of-a-mars-size-exoplanet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kepler's laws of motion</a>.  </p>

<p>TRAPPIST-1 was initially determined to have planets orbiting it by the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope - South team.  From their data they determined that it had at least 3 planets.  One of these planets was in the habitable zone of the star.  They published their results in the journal <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v533/n7602/full/nature17448.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Nature</em></a> in May 2016.</p>

<p>Once TRAPPIST had determined that the system had planets around it, NASA trained the Spitzer Space Telescope on it.  Ground-based observations of Trappist-1 are difficult because it is so dim.  Spitzer, an infrared telescope, made more precise measurements of the light curves and determined that there were at least <a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-telescope-reveals-largest-batch-of-earth-size-habitable-zone-planets-around"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">7 planets</a> in orbit around it, 3 of which were in the habitable zone.

"Are there observable changes in a star about to become supernova, minutes or hours before the explosion?","4243","","<p>I am writing a science fiction novel, where a ship is stranded in a single star system (a red supergiant). One of the plot points is the star becoming supernova in several hours, so the characters have to fix their ship before that happens.</p>

<p>I have basic knowledge of how it works: Iron generated from nuclear fusion gets accumulated in the core, until it reaches a point when iron fusion starts. As iron fusion is an endothermic reaction, the core is no longer able to generate enough energy to hold against its own gravity and external layers pressure, so it collapses, and explode.</p>

<p>I have read that once the iron fusion starts inside the core, the collapse occurs within minutes, that the collapse itself lasts a few seconds (even less than a second), and that the shockwave takes several hours to reach the surface. Is all that correct?</p>

<p>The thing is that I need the characters to bee able to predict the explosion in a short term. A few hours or even minutes. It would be great if they could be aware of the core collapse and start a countdown.</p>

<p>So, are there any external cue of these events, like changes in luminosity or color? Does the star spectrum change when iron fusion starts, or when the core collapses? I know that the core collapse generates a huge amount of neutrinos. Is this amount so intense that it can be easily detectable? (that is, without a huge detector in an underground facility). Can the amount of iron in the core be estimated from tha star spectrum and size, so the aproximate time of the collapse could be predicted?</p>
","<p>I think your best bet would be detecting neutrinos generated by nuclear burning inside the star (as we do for the Sun). Once the star hits the carbon-burning stage, it's actually putting out more energy in neutrinos than in photons. During the silicon-burning phase, which lasts for a few days and is what creates the degenerate iron core (that collapses once it is massive enough), the neutrino flux increases to about 10<sup>47</sup> erg/s a few seconds before core collapse.

Since your characters are <em>in the same system</em> as the star, they'd hardly need a large underground detector to pick up the neutrinos.</p>

<p>This plot shows an example of neutrino luminosity (for anti-electron neutrinos) versus time for a pre-supernova star (from Asakura et al. 2016, based on Odrzywolek &amp; Heger 2010 and Nakazato et al. 2013); core collapse begins at t = 0s.</p>

<p>By measuring the spectrum of energies for different types of neutrinos and their time evolution, you could probably get a very good idea of how far along the star was, particularly as we can probably assume your characters have much better models for stellar evolution than we currently do. (They'd also want to get accurate measurements of the star's mass, rotation rate, maybe internal structure via astroseismology, etc., in order to fine-tune the stellar-evolution model; these are all things they could do pretty easily.)</p>

<p>The core collapse itself would be signalled by the <em>enormous</em> increase in neutrino flux.</p>

<p><a href=""https://what-if.xkcd.com/73/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This ""What If"" article</a> by Randall Munroe estimates that the neutrino flux from a core-collapse supernova would be <em>lethal</em> to a human being at a distance of around 2 AU. Which, as he points out, could actually be inside of a supergiant star, so your characters would probably be a bit further away than that. But it does show that the neutrino flux would be easily detectable, and that your characters might well get radiation poisoning from it if they were closer than 10 AU. (Of course, you'd want to <em>detect</em> it more directly than just waiting around till you started to feel sick, since that might take longer than the shock wave takes to reach the surface of the star.) This is just to bring home the fact that they wouldn't have any problem detecting the neutrinos....</p>

"Why didn't the Big Bang produce heavier elements?","4207","","<p>Shortly after the Big Bang, temperatures cooled from the Planck temperature. Once temperatures lowered to 116 gigakelvins, nucleosynthesis took place and helium, lithium and trace amounts of other elements were created.</p>

<p>However, if the temperatures were so high shortly after the Big Bang, why weren't much heavier elements produced? 116 gigakelvins is obviously far above the temperature required for elements like carbon and oxygen to fuse. In addition, shouldn't most of the protons at those temperatures have fused, leaving the Universe with mostly heavier elements?</p>
","<p>I think that your thought process is flawed in that you assume that by drastically increasing the temperature you are guaranteed to get heavy elements. As odd as this may sound, this isn't the case (especially during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)) for a few reasons. In fact, if you took a hydrogen-only star and made it go supernova, you wouldn't get heavy elements like you see in current stars going supernova.</p>

<p><strong>BBN Timescale</strong></p>

<p>One major point to consider is that the BBN era is calculated to be only ~20 min long. That isn't really much time to form elements. Sure, supernovae happen in an instantaneous flash, but there are other things going on there, which I'll get to in a second. The main point here is that fusing takes time and 20 min isn't that much time to form heavy elements.</p>

<p><strong>Deuterium</strong></p>

<p>To get heavy elements, you need to build up to them. You can't just smash together 50 protons and 50 neutrons and get tin. So the first step is to smash together a proton and neutron to get deuterium, but here you already run into a problem known as the deuterium bottleneck. As it turns out, the huge temperatures actually (and somewhat counterintuitively) impede the creation of deuterium. This is mainly because the deuteron will end up having so much energy that it will be able to overcome the binding energy (and deuterium has pretty low binding energy being that its only two nucleons) and will likely break apart again. Of course, given the density and temperature you can still get a good amount of deuterium simply by force of will, but not as much and not at the rate you'd expect otherwise. Another point that makes deuterium form less frequently that you'd naïvely expect is that the proton to neutron ratio before BBN was about 7:1 due to the proton being more favorable to be created since it has a slightly lower mass. So 6 out of 7 protons didn't have a corresponding neutron to combine with and had to wait for deuterium to form first before it could combine with anything.</p>

<p><strong>Tritium, Helium, Lithium, Oh My!</strong></p>

<p>Deuterium is then the catalyst for forming all the next stages of particles in your soup. From here you can throw them together with various other things to get $^3\mathrm{He}$, $^3\mathrm{H}$, and $^4\mathrm{He}$. Once you've got a good amount of deuterium, tritium, and helium isotopes floating around, you can start making lithium and if you're lucky a bit of beryllium.</p>

<p><strong>To Boron and Beyond</strong></p>

<p>But now, once again you run into a bottleneck, and one more severe than the deuterium bottleneck. You can't easily jump to heavier elements with what you have on hand. The next fusion chain, and the way stars do it, is the triple-alpha process which helps to form carbon but to perform this chain and build up enough carbon you need a <em>lot</em> of time. And we only have 20 minutes! There just isn't time to form the carbon we need to progress along the fusion cycle. As I hinted at the beginning, pure hydrogen stars also wouldn't produce heavy elements upon supernova for this reason. They're able to produce heavy elements now because they've had billions of years before their SN event to build up a base amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc. that can aid in the heavy element fusion processes.</p>

<p>So you don't have the time to follow the triple alpha process and make carbon — what about other processes? Surely the temperatures are high enough that you can do different fusion methods not seen in stars. Well... no. You can't even smash together lots of $\mathrm{He}$ or $\mathrm{Li}$ to get really heavy elements because of the fact that heavy nuclei are only stable if they have way more neutrons than protons. And we already said there was a big neutron deficiency early on so the chance you have enough neutrons hanging around to smash together to get, say $^{112}\mathrm{Sn}$ (that's tin with 62 neutrons), is pretty small. What's more, you can't even try to either skip carbon by making something slightly heavier or form something intermediary between lithium and carbon. Again, this is because of stability issues. So with no other options, you have to shoot for carbon after lithium, and as stated above, you just don't have time for that.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>Overall, BBN is limited to getting only to lithium because of limited time, proton to neutron abundance ratios, and fusion bottlenecks that slow things down. All these come together to produce ~75% $^1\mathrm{H}$, ~25% $^4\mathrm{He}$, ~0.01% $^2\mathrm{H}$ and $^3\mathrm{He}$, and trace amounts of $\mathrm{Li}$.</p>

"Why do stars become red giants?","4192","","<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I’m not a career astronomer.  I don’t own a telescope.  I have no professional credentials.  But I do find this stuff fascinating, and I consume all the astronomy documentaries I can.  </p>

<hr>

<p>So, I’ve watched lots of documentaries describing stellar evolution.  I understand that below a certain threshold, stellar death does not involve supernovae.  I understand that above that threshold, supernovae may create neutron stars, magnetars, or (if the supernova qualifies as a hypernova) black holes.</p>

<p>However, for a long time, I was curious about <strong>why</strong> stars below the supernova threshold—like our own Sun—become Red Giants.</p>

<hr>

<p>From documentaries, I have been instructed that (for stars below the supernova threshold), when the star’s core’s fusion cannot continue…fusion ceases, and the star begins to collapse under gravity.  </p>

<p>As gravity crushes the star, I understand that the star heats up as gravity crushes it.  As a result, although the stellar core remains “dead” (no fusion occurs), a “shell” of gas around the stellar core becomes hot enough to begin fusing helium.  Since the fusion occurs as a “shell” around the stellar core, the outward-push from the fusion is what pushes the star’s outer layers further.  The result is that the star grows into a Red Giant.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My question is this:</strong>  Why does fusion cease in the core?!  It seems to me that as gravity crushes the star, stellar fusion would reignite in the core itself—not in a sphere around the core.  Why does the stellar core remain “dead” while its “shell” begins fusion???</p>
","<p>(This is somewhat simplified but I hope it gets the idea across.)</p>

<p>The reactions stop in the core because it runs out of fuel. During the main sequence, the star is supported by the fusion of hydrogen into helium. Eventually, the hydrogen runs out at the centre, so hydrogen fusion is no longer possible there.</p>

<p>Why doesn't it start fusing helium into carbon right away? That's because the core isn't hot or dense enough yet. Different reactions broadly rely on the presence of different resonant states in the nuclei and, in the case of helium, such a state cannot be reached often enough until the core temperature is about $10^8$ kelvin.</p>

<p>In order to get that hot, the core has to contract and heat up. It eventually does (if the star is massive enough) but it doesn't happen instantaneously. Remember that the gas is still hot and at high pressure, which it exerts on itself and its surroundings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the edge of the core, the star (partly as a result of said contraction) <em>is</em> hot enough to turn hydrogen into helium, so it does so. This is exactly the nuclear-burning shell that distinguishes the internal structure of a red giant.</p>

<p>So maybe think of it this way. Imagine a star at the end of the main sequence. Where is it hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium? Everywhere up to the edge of the core! Does it fuse in the core? No, because it's out of fuel. So where does it fuse? At the edge of the core, which we recognize as the shell.</p>

"How did our ancestors discover the Solar System?","4065","","<p>I wonder, how did our ancestors discover the Solar System? They did not have any telescopes to see distant objects, right? Even a planet looks like a star from a distance.</p>

<p>They discovered the rotations of different planets without having much technology.</p>
","<h1>1. Ancient cultures observed the sky</h1>

<p>Night skies are naturally dark and there was no light-pollution in ancient times. So if weather permits, you can easily see a lot of stars. No need to tell about the Sun and the Moon.</p>

<p>Ancient people had good reasons to study the night skies. In many cultures and civilizations, stars (and also the Sun and the Moon) where perceived to have religious, legendary, premonitory or magical significance (astrology), so a lot of people were interested in them. It did not took long to someone (in reality a lot of different people independently in many parts of the world) to see some useful patterns in the stars that would be useful to navigation, localization, counting hours, counting days and relating days to seasons, etc. And of course, those patterns in the stars were also related to the Sun and the Moon.</p>

<p>So, surely all ancient cultures had people who dedicated many nights of their lifes to study the stars in detail right from the stone age. They would also perceive meteorites (falling stars) and eclipses. And sometimes a very rare and spetacular comet.</p>

<p>Then there are the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. They are quite easily to notice to be distinct from the stars because all the stars seems to be fixed in the celestial sphere, but the planets don't. They are very easily to notice to be wandering around in the sky with the passage of the days, specially for Venus, which is the brightest ""star"" in the sky and is also a formidable wanderer. Given all of that, the ancient people surely become very aware of those five planets.</p>

<p>About Mercury, initially the Greeks thought that Mercury were two bodies, one that showed up only in the morning a few hours before the sunrise and another only a few hours after the sunset. However, soon they figured out that in fact it was only one body, because either one or the other (or neither) could be seen in a given day and the computed position of the unseen body always matched the position of the seen body.</p>

<h1>2. The Earth seems to be round</h1>

<p>Now, out of the stone age, already into ancient times, navigators and merchants who travelled great distances perceived that the Sun rising and setting points could variate not only due to the seasonal variation, but also accordingly to the location. Also, the distance from the polar star to the horizon line also variates accordingly with the location. This fact denounces the existence of the concept nowadays known as latitude, and this was perceived by ancient astronomers in places like Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia and China.</p>

<p>Astronomers and people who dependend on astronomy (like navigators) would wonder why the distance from the polar star to the horizon varied, and one possibility was that it is because the Earth would be round. Also, registering different Sun angles in different locations of the world on a given same day and at a given same hour, also gives a hint that the Earth is round. The shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse also gives a hint that the Earth is round. However, this by itself is not a proof that the Earth is round, so most people would bet on some other simpler thing, or simply don't care about this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Most cultures in ancient times presumed that the world was flat. However the idea of the world being round exists since the ancient Greece. Contrary to the popular modern misconception, <a href=""http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">in the Middle Ages, almost no educated person on the western world thought that the world was flat</a>.</p>

<p>About the Earth's size, by observing different Sun positions and shadows angles in different parts of the world, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes"" rel=""nofollow"">Erasthotenes</a> in ancient Greece calculated the size of Earth and the distance between the Earth and the Sun correctly for the first time as back as the third century B.C. However, due to the confusion about all the different and inconsistent unit measures existent back then and the difficulty to precisely estimate long land and sea distances, confusion and imprecision persisted until the modern times.</p>

<p>Ancient cultures also figured out that the shiny part of the Moon was illuminated by the Sun. Since the Full Moon is easily seen even at midnight, this implies that the Earth is not infinite. The fact that the Moon enters in a rounded shadow when exactly in the opposite side of the sky as the Sun also implies that it is the Earth's shadow on the Moon. This also implies that Earth is significantly larger than Moon.</p>

<h1>3. Geocentrism</h1>

<p>So, people observed the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the fixed sphere of stars all revolving around the sky. They naturally thought that the Earth would be the center of the universe and that all of those bodies revolved around the Earth. This culminated with the work of the phylosopher Claudius Ptolemaeus about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model#Ptolemaic_model"" rel=""nofollow"">geocentrism</a>.</p>

<p>Altough we now know that the ptolomaic geocentric model is fundamentally wrong, it could be used to compute the position of the planets, the Sun, the Moon and the celestial sphere of stars, with a somewhat acceptable precision at the time. It accounted to include the observation of planets velocity variations, retrograde motions and also for coupling Mercury and Venus to the Sun, so they would never go very far from it. Further, based on the velocity of the motion of those bodies in the sky, then the universe should be something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Earth at the center.</li>
<li>Moon orbiting the Earth.</li>
<li>Mercury orbiting the Earth farther than the Moon.</li>
<li>Venus orbiting the Earth farther than Mercury.</li>
<li>Sun orbiting the Earth farther than Venus.</li>
<li>Mars orbiting the Earth farther than Sun.</li>
<li>Jupiter orbiting the Earth farther than Mars.</li>
<li>Saturn orbiting the Earth farther than Jupiter.</li>
<li>The celestial sphere of stars rotating around the Earth, being the outermost sphere.</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, the ptolomaic model is a very complicated model, way more complicated than the copernic, keplerian and newtonian models. Particularly, this could be compared to softwares that are based on severely flawed concepts but that are still working due to a lot of complex, tangled and unexplainable hacks and kludges that are there just for the sake of making the thing work.</p>

<h1>4. The discovery of the Americas</h1>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo"" rel=""nofollow"">Marco Polo</a>, in the last years of the 1200's, was the first European to travel to China and back and leave a detailed chronicle of his experience. So, he could bring a lot of knowledge about what existed in the central Asia, the East of Asia, the Indies, China, Mongolia and even Japan to the Europeans. Before Marco Polo, very few was known to the Europeans about what existed there. This greatly inspired European cartographers, philosophers, politicians and navigators in the years to come.</p>

<p>Portugal and Spain fough <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista"" rel=""nofollow"">a centuries-long war against the invading Moors on the Iberian Peninsula</a>. The Moors were finally expelled in 1492. The two states, were looking for something profitable after so many years of war. Since Portugal ended its part of the war first, it had a head start and went to explore the seas first. Both Portugal and Spain were trying to find a navigation route to reach the Indias and the China in order to trade highly profitable spices and silk. Those couldn't be traded by land efficiently anymore due to the fact that the lands on West Asia and North Africa were dominated by Muslim cultures unfriendly to Christian Europeans, a situation that were just made worse after the fall of Constantinople in 1453.</p>

<p>Portugal, were colonizing the Atlantic borders of Africa and eventually they managed to reach the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 (with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeu_Dias"" rel=""nofollow"">Bartolomeu Dias</a>).</p>

<p>A Genovese navigator called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus"" rel=""nofollow"">Cristoforo Colombo</a> believed that if he sailed west from the Europe, he could eventually reach the Indies from the east side. Inspired by Marco Polo and subestimating the size of Earth, he estimated that the distance between the Canary Islands and the Japan to be 3700 km (in fact it is 12500 km). Most navigators would not venture in such voyage because they (rightly) tought that Earth was larger than that.</p>

<p>Colombo tried to convice the king of Portugal to finance his journey in 1485, but after submitting the proposal to experts, the king rejected it because the estimated journey distance was too low. Spain, however, after finally expelling the Moors in 1492, were convinced by him. Colombo's idea was far-fetched, but, after centuries of wars with the Muslims, if that worked, then Spain could profit quickly. So, the Spanish king approved the idea. And just a few months after expelling the Moors, Spain sent Colombo to sail west towards the Atlantic and then he reach the Hispaniola island in Central America. After coming back, the news about the discovery of lands in the other side of the Atlantic spread quickly.</p>

<p>Portugal and Spain then divided the world by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tordesillas"" rel=""nofollow"">Treaty of Tordesillas</a> in 1494. In 1497, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerigo_Vespucci"" rel=""nofollow"">Amerigo Vespucci</a> reached the mainland America.</p>

<p>Portugal would not be left behind, they managed to navigate around Africa to reach the Indies in 1498 (with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama"" rel=""nofollow"">Vasco da Gama</a>). And they sent <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral"" rel=""nofollow"">Pedro Álvares Cabral</a>, who reached the Brazil in 1500 before crossing the Atlantic back in order to go for the Indies.</p>

<p>After that, Portugal and Spain quickly started to explore the Americas and eventually colonize them. France, England and Netherlands also came to the Americas some time later.</p>

<h1>5. The Earth IS round</h1>

<p>After, the Spanish discovered and settled into the Americas (and Colombo's plan in fact didn't worked). The question that if it was possible to sail around the globe to reach the Indies from the east side remained open and the Spanish were still interested on it. They eventually discovered the Pacific Ocean after crossing the Panama Ishtums by land in 1513.</p>

<p>Eager to find a maritime route around the globe, the Spanish crown funded an expedition leadered by the Portuguese <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan"" rel=""nofollow"">Fernão de Magalhães</a> (or Magellan as his name was translated to English) to try to circle the globe. Magellan was an experienced navigator, and had reached what is present day Malaysia traveling through the Indian Ocean before. They departed from Spain in September 20th, 1519. It was a long and though journey that costed the lives of most of the crew. Magellan himself did not survived, having died in a battle in the Phillipines on 1521. At least, he lived enough to be aware that they in fact reached East Asia by traveling around the globe to the west, which also proves that the Earth is round.</p>

<p>The journey was eventually completed by the leadership of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano"" rel=""nofollow"">Juan Sebatián Elcano</a>, one of the crewmen of Magellan. They reached Spain back through the Indian and Atlantic Oceans on September 6th, 1522 after traveling for almost three years a distance of 81449 km.</p>

<h1>6. Heliocentrism</h1>

<p>There were some heliocentric or hybrid geo-heliocentric theories in ancient times. Notably by the Greek philosopher <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philolaus"" rel=""nofollow"">Philolaus</a> in the 5th century BC. By <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martianus_Capella"" rel=""nofollow"">Martianus Capella</a> around the years 410 to 420. And by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos"" rel=""nofollow"">Aristarchus of Samos</a> around 370 BC. Those models tried to explain the motion of the stars as rotation of the Earth and the position of the planets, specially Mercury and Venus as translation around the Sun. However those early models were too imprecise and flawed to work appropriately, and the ptolomaic model still was the model with the better prediction of the positions of the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>The idea that the Earth rotates was much less revolutionary than heliocentrism, but <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation#History"" rel=""nofollow"">was already more-or-less accepted with reluctancy in the middle ages</a>. This happens because if the stars rotated around Earth, they would need do so at an astonishing velocity, dragging the Sun, the Moon and the planets with it, so it would be easier if Earth itself rotated. People were uncomfortable with this idea, but they still accepted it, and this became easier to be accepted after the Earth sphericity was an established concept.</p>

<p>In the first years of the 1500's, while the Portuguese and Spanish were sailing around the globe, a polish and very skilled matemathical and astronomer called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus"" rel=""nofollow"">Nikolaus Kopernikus</a> took some years thinking about the mechanics of the heavenly bodies. After some years making calculations and observations, he created a model of circular orbits of the planets around the Sun and perceived that his model were much more simpler than the ptolomaic geocentric model and was at least as precise. His model also features a rotating Earth and fixed stars. Further, his model implied that the Sun was much larger than the Earth, something that was already strongly suspected at the time due to calculations and measurements and also implied that Jupiter and Saturn were several times larger than Earth, so Earth would definitively be a planet just like the other five then-known planets were. This could be seen as the borning of the model today know as Solar System.</p>

<p>Fearing persecution and harsh criticism, he avoided to publish many of his works, sending manuscripts to only his closest acquaintances, however his works eventually leaked out and he was convinced to allow its full publication anyway. Legend says that he was presented to his finally fully published work in the very day that he died in 1543, so he could die in peace.</p>

<p>There was a heated debate between supporters and oppositors of Copernic's heliocentric theory in the middle 1500's. One argument for the opposition was that star parallaxes could not be observed, which implied that either the heliocentric model was wrong or that the stars were very very far and many of them would be even larger than the Sun, which seemed to be a crazy idea at the time.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe"" rel=""nofollow"">Tycho Brache</a>, which did not accepted heliocentrism, in the latest years of the 1500's tried to save geocentrism with an hybrid geo-heliocentric model that featured the five heavenly planets orbiting the Sun while the Sun and the Moon orbited Earth. However, he also published a theory which better predicted the position of the Moon. Also, by this time, the observation of some supernovas showed that the celestial sphere of the stars were not exactly immutable.</p>

<p>In 1600, the astronomer <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(astronomer)"" rel=""nofollow"">William Gilbert</a> provided strong argument for the rotation of Earth, by studing magnets and compasses, he could demonstrate that the Earth was magnetic, which could be explained by the presence of enourmous quantities of iron in its core.</p>

<h1>7. With telescopes</h1>

<p>All of what I wrote above happened without telescopes, only by using naked eye observations and measurements around the globe. Now, add even some small telescopes and things change quickly.</p>

<p>The earliest telescopes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope"" rel=""nofollow"">were invented in 1608</a>. In 1609, the astronomer <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei"" rel=""nofollow"">Galieu Galilei</a> heard about that, and constructed his own telescope. In January of 1610, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei"" rel=""nofollow"">Galieu Galilei</a>, using a small telescope, observed four small bodies orbiting Jupiter at different distances, figuring out that they were Jupiter's ""moons"", he also could predict and calculate its positions along their orbits. Some months later, he also observed that Venus had phases as seen from the Earth. He also observed Saturn's rings, but his telescope was not powerful enough to resolve them as rings, and he tought that they were two moons. These observations were incompatible with the geocentric model.</p>

<p>A contemporary of Galilei, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler"" rel=""nofollow"">Johannes Kepler</a>, working on Copernicus' heliocentric model and making a lot of calculations, in order to explain the differing orbital velocities, created an heliocentric model where the planets orbits the Sun in elliptic orbits with one of the ellipse's focus in the Sun. His works were published in 1609 and 1619. He also suggested that tides were caused by the motion of the Moon, though Galilei was skeptical to that. His laws predicted a transit of Mercury in 1631 and of Venus in 1639, and such transit were in fact observed. However, a predicted transit of Venus in 1631 could not be seen due to imprecision in calculations and the fact that it was not visible in much of the Europe.</p>

<p>In 1650 the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_star"" rel=""nofollow"">first double star</a> were observed. Further in the 1600's, the Saturn rings were resolved by the use of better telescopes by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke"" rel=""nofollow"">Robert Hooke</a>, who also observed a double star 1664 and developed microscopes to observe cellular structures. From them on, many stars were discovered to be double. In 1655, Titan were discovered orbiting Saturn, putting more confidence on the heliocentric model. More four Saturnian moons were discovered between 1671 and 1684.</p>

<h1>8. Gravitation</h1>

<p>Heliocentrism was reasonably well-accepted in the middle 1600's, but people was not confortable with it. Why the planets orbits the Sun afterall? Why the Moon orbits Earth? Why Jupiter and Saturn had moons? Although Keplerian mechanics could predict their moviment, it was still unclear what was the reason that makes them move that way.</p>

<p>In 1687, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"" rel=""nofollow"">Isaac Newton</a> who was one of the most brilliant physic and mathematic that ever lived (although he was also an implacable persecutor of his opponents), provided the gravitational theory (based on prior work by Robert Hooke). Ideas for the gravitation theory and the inverse square law already were developed in the 1670's, but he could publish a a very simple and clear theory for gravitation, very well-fundamented in physics and mathematics and it explained the motions of the celestial bodies with a great precision, including comets. It also explained why the planets, the Moon and the Sun are spherical, explained tides and it also served to explain why things falls to the ground. This made heliocentrism to be definitely widely accepted.</p>

<p>Also, Newton gravitational law predicted that Earth rotation would make it not exactly spherical, but a bit ellipsoidal by a factor of 1:230. Something that agreed with measures done using pendulums in 1673.</p>

<h1>9. What are the stars and the Solar System afterall?</h1>

<p>In the early 1700's, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley"" rel=""nofollow"">Edmund Halley</a>, already knowing about newtonian laws (he was a contemporary of Newton) perceived that comets who passed near Earth would eventually return, and he found that there was a particular instance of sightings every 76 years, so he could note that those comets in reality were all the same comet, which is called after him.</p>

<p>The only remaining problem with the heliocentric model was the lack of observation of parallax to the stars. And nobody knew for sure what the stars were. However, if they in fact are very distant bodies, most of them would be much larger than the Sun. At the first half of the 1700's, trying to observe parallax, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bradley"" rel=""nofollow"">James Bradley</a> perceived phenomena like the aberration of light and the Earth's nutation, and those phenomena also provides a way to calculate the speed of light. But the observation of parallax remained a challenge during the 1700's.</p>

<p>In 1781, Uranus were discovered orbiting the Sun beyond Saturn. Although barely visible to the naked eye in the darkest skies, it was so dim that he escaped observation from astronomers until then, and so were discovered with a telescope. The first asteroids were also discovered in the early 1800's. Investigation on pertubations on Uranus' orbit due to the predicted newtonian and keplerian movement eventually leaded to the discovery of Neptune in 1846.</p>

<p>In 1838, the astronomer <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Bessel"" rel=""nofollow"">Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel</a> who measured the position of more than 50000 stars with the greatest precision as possible, could finally measure the parallax of the star 61 Cygni successfully, which proved that stars were in fact very distant bodies and that many of them were in fact larger than the Sun. This also demonstrates that the Sun is a star. Vega and Alpha Centauri also had their parallaxes measured successfully in 1838. Further, those measurements permitted to estimate the distance between those stars and the Solar System to be on the order of many trillions of kilometers, or several light-years.</p>

<p>More importantly, can I safely observe these with an amateur telescope? I imagine they would be big enough to spot should one happen!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oOE5V.jpg"" alt=""supernova""></p>
","<p>It's a matter of size and stellar evolution.  There are many, many types of stellar explosions.  <a href=""http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/lectures/supernovae.htm"">The University of Arizona has one page that describes these types</a>.  generally, a Novs is not what we think of (i.e. a star exploding). That's actually a Type II Supernova.</p>

<p>According to that site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Novae are frequently (perhaps always) members of binary systems where the more massive star evolves more quickly and becomes a white dwarf. The less massive star loses some of its hydrogen-rich outer atmosphere to the white dwarf where it collects.  The high gravity and intense heat of the white dwarf make conditions suitable for hydrogen fusion into helium. When enough hydrogen collects, it explodes in a fusion reaction, causing a nova. The gas ejected in the explosion moves outwards at 1000-2000 km/sec.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Supernova has two distinct types:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ""Type I"" supernovae arise when the white dwarf star member of a binary system accretes so much matter from its companion that it is tipped over the 1.4M Chandrasekar limit. The white dwarf collapses very rapidly (just a few seconds) until the infalling layers hit the very hard surface of the neutron star. The resulting shock goes back through the collapsing layers, and they explode by hydrogen fusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the one we are more familiar with from popular media:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ""Type II"" supernovae are the result of a massive star consuming all of its nuclear fuel and then exploding. The black line traces the evolution of a massive star schematically, until it reaches the supernova stage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://spot.pcc.edu/~aodman/GS%20107%20web/end%20of%20main%20sequence/supernovae.htm"">Portland Community College actually lists a lot of the variations that happen in the different types of supernovas out there</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type I: supernovae WITHOUT hydrogen absorption lines in their spectrum 
  Type II: supernovae WITH hydrogen absorption lines in their spectrum.</p>
  
  <p>Type II
  The type II supernovae are massive stars whose iron cores collapse and then rebound, shock heating the outer layers of the star, which then explode outward.</p>
  
  <p>Type I
  The type I supernovae are subdivided into three subclasses, called (boringly enough), Type Ia, Type Ib, and Type Ic. 
  Type Ia: no hydrogen lines, no helium lines, strong silicon lines 
  Type Ib: no hydrogen lines, strong helium lines 
  Type Ic: no hydrogen lines, no helium lines, no silicon lines</p>
  
  <p>Type Ib and type Ic supernovae are massive stars which lost their outer layers in a stellar wind before core collapse. 
  Type Ib supernovae lost their hydrogen-rich outer layer, revealing the helium-rich layer immediately below. 
  Type Ic supernovae suffered more mass loss as supergiants, losing both the hydrogen-rich layer and the helium-rich layer (revealing the carbon-rich layer below). 
  Type Ib and type Ic supernovae are essentially the same as type II supernovae. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for observing them, since none of them are expected to be close to us (i.e. no stars near us able to go supernova), it should be safe. The problem is predicting when one will happen.  For instance, Betelgeuse is expected to go supernova ""soon"", but in stellar terms, that could be well over 100,000 years from now. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supernova_candidates"">The list of candidates in the Milky Way doesn't bode well for one in your lifetime</a>.

"Why isn't interstellar medium pulled in towards nearest massive object?","3872","","<p>How does the ISM resist gravity? That's the only force acting on it, and all other particles seem to collect together to form stars. What makes the ISM so special among other particles?</p>
","<p>It is not true that the particles in the interstellar medium (ISM) are only acted upon by gravity. In many cases a significant part of the ISM is ionized, in which case it interacts with magnetic field which permeates the gas and may in some cases be quite strong.
In the vicinity of massive and hence luminous stars, radiation pressure may exert a strong force on the ISM. Supernova explosions create hot bubbles that expand and sweep through the ISM, resulting in shock waves. </p>

<p>In most cases, however, what may prevent a gas cloud from collapsing is simply its temperature.
Despite all the above processes, and despite gravity being the weakest force, gas clouds do sometimes collapse to form stars. The criterion for doing so is that the gas is dense enough, and that its internal pressure (or thermal energy) is weak enough. This is described by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans_instability"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jeans instability</a>. One way to express this is the <em>Jeans mass</em> $M_J$ (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1902RSPTA.199....1J"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jeans 1902</a>) which is the critical mass of a cloud where thermal energy is exactly balanced by gravitational forces:
$$
M_J = \rho \left( \frac{\pi k_B T}{4 \mu m_u G \rho} \right)^{3/2} \\
\propto \frac{T^{3/2}}{\rho^{1/2}}.
$$
Here, $k_B$, $G$, and $m_u$ are Boltzmannn's constant, the gravitational constant, and the atomic mass unit, while $T$, $\mu$, and $\rho$ are the temperature, the mean molecular mass, and the density of the gas.</p>

<p>In the second line of the equation it is emphasized that $M_J$ increases with temperature, and <em>de</em>creases with density. In other words, if the gas is too hot, or too dilute, the total mass needed to collapse must be higher.</p>

<p>In general, gas will not collapse to form stars if the temperature is above some $10^4\,\mathrm{K}$. If the temperature is higher, the particles simply move too fast. Since various processes may easily heat the ISM to millions of degrees, the gas has to cool before it can collapse. On way to do this is by cooling radiation: Fast-moving atoms collide (either with each other or, more often, with electrons). Some of the kinetic energy of the atoms is spent exciting their electrons to higher levels. When the atoms de-excite, photons are emitted which can leave the system. The net result is that thermal energy is removed from the cloud, until at some point it has cooled enough to collapse.</p>

","<p>Actually, you sometimes can see the Moon illuminated by the Sun from the top, and therein lies the answer to your question - during day. When looking at the Moon during night time, the side of the Earth where you're standing and looking at it is pointed away from the Sun, while this is reversed during the day. The illuminated side of the Moon is also facing the Sun, of course. So we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Night time on Earth: Side illuminated by the Sun is ""below us"" and that's where the Moon is illuminated from too.</li>

So, when you see the Sun high above the skies, and if the Moon is visible during daytime, it's going to be illuminated from the same direction from which you are, and during night time, when you'd expect the Sun ""below where you're standing"", it's illuminated from that direction.</p>

Also, I'm wondering how to calculate the position of a place (latitude and longitude) while the declination and the right ascension of a star at the zenith is known.</p>
","<p>For the second question: If you know the coordinates of the Zenith, your latitude is exactly Zenith's declination. For your longitude you can not rely on the Zenith: the same star will be at the Zenith at the same sidereous time for every place in the same latitude, so you need a clock besides the telescope. <em>cf</em>. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude#Problem_of_longitude"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude#Problem_of_longitude</a></p>

<p>For the first question: The altitude of a star that is crossing the local meridian is also quite easy.</p>

$90-alt=dec-lat$</p>

","<p>No, no stars have an exactly spherical shape. The reason for this is that the centrifugal force of the star's rotation is much greater at the equator of the star than it is at the poles, for the simple reason that the rotational velocity is greater. This greater centrifugal force pushes the equator outwards, stretching the star into an oblate shape. This is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_darkening"" rel=""noreferrer"">gravity darkening</a>.</p>

"Why is twilight longer in summer than winter and shortest at the equinox","3763","","<p>I recently decided to set my alarm clock to wake me up when it is ""dark"" out.  In the end, I decided to set my clock to the earliest time that nautical sunrise is in my state (Illinois) and stick with that all year.</p>

<p>While doing some research for this, I noticed something that surprised me.  Check out this disparity between astronomical sunrise to civil sunrise for the solstices and equinox (the latter two adjusted for daylight saving time):</p>

<p>Date/Astronomical/Civil/Disparity</p>

<ul>
<li>Dec 20: 0533 - 0640 (67 minutes)</li>
<li>Mar 20: 0526 - 0630 (64 minutes)</li>
<li>Jun 20: 0320 - 0451 (91 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>To be honest, these sets of ranges surprise me for multiple reasons.  I clearly don't know what I don't know, but here are some questions I can formulate:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Why would twilight be longer in summer than winter?</strong>  Before seeing this data, I had assumed that since the sun makes a more perpendicular path through the horizon in summer that twilight would be shorter in summer than in winter.  After all, in winter the sun takes a ""slanted"" path across the horizon.  Wouldn't the summer's path be more direct and therefore quicker?</li>
<li>OK: seeing this empirical evidence I conclude that something is wrong with my premise that forms my first question.  Summer twilight is longer in summer than winter.  However, I still would have assumed that March 20 would have had a twilight length in between the two solstices.  But it's not!  <strong>Why does the equinox have the shortest twilight?</strong> </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Appended 5/13/2014:</p>

<p>I didn't want to leave my original incorrect statement in here without flagging it. As Cheekhu points out below, the sun does <strong>not</strong> follow a more perpendicular path in summer than winter, as I had erroneously assumed and stated above.  See his post for more details.</p>
","<p>See this diagram,</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4FlyA.png"" alt=""Celestial Sphere""></p>

<p>Now, the <em>slant</em> appears to be the same for June and December Solstices, doesn't it? First thing, it is a wrong conception that Sun travels more ""perpendicular"" to horizon in the summers. It just reaches a <em>higher</em> point as you can see, not that the slant is more.</p>

<p>Where does the disparity come in?</p>

<p>Civil Sunrise begins when the Sun is 6° below the horizon, Nautical Sunrise begins when it is 12° below the horizon and 18° for Astronomical Sunrise.</p>

<p>So, the Civil/Astronomical Disparity is due to the extra 12° of altitude that the Sun has to cover. Now, the diagram I have posted is better to explain the sunset, so let it be that way. It is just the same for our purpose. </p>

<p>The motion of the sun is uniform along the circles that you see. But these angles which decide our sunrise are measured perpendicular to the horizon, from the zenith. Are you aware of what happens when you project circular motion along a straight line?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LrtC7.jpg"" alt=""circular motion projection on  line""></p>

<p>That's right. You get a sinusoidal curve. The special thing about this curve is that it changes fast at some points and slow at others. 
Transit is the position when the Sun is highest in the sky. In the <em>curve for equinox</em> (as in Fig 1), if you assign 0° to that point, the Sun is at 90° at sunset and -90° at sunrise. Both positions give you the peak of a sine curve and the change is lowest at that point. That might explain why you get the least difference at Equinox. </p>

<p>Now, if you consider the curves for June/December solstice (as in Fig 1), the position for sunset/sunrise is a little off 90°, hence rate of change is faster there as compared to the equinox. </p>

<p>That should explain why the disparity is larger at solstices as compared to equinox. But what about the difference in June and Decemeber solstice?</p>

<p>Now, my dear, you are entering dangerous territories. Let me remind you that the line/plane along which we are making our degree measurements is perpendicular to horizon. But the plane of circular motion is still at an angle to it. So, the sinusoidal curve has to go through another set of projections before you get the exact thing. 
On Equator, the disparity between the solstices vanish, yes, as the aforementioned two planes align.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was hoping to give you a qualitative description just so you get the gist of it. Here are the equations if you need a <em>mathematical</em> idea</p>

<p>$$\cos a = \sin \delta \sin \phi + \cos \delta \cos \phi \cos H$$,</p>

<p>$a$ is (90+6)° for civil sunrise/set, and (90+18)° for astronomical sunrise/set,</p>

<p>$\delta$ is declination of Sun on that date. Google it.</p>

<p>$\phi$ is latitude of the place</p>

<p>To get the disparity, you need to find $H$ from the formula for two values of $a$ and get their difference. Remember to divide by 15 to convert from degrees to hours.</p>

<p>Here is a graph showing disparity along declination(-23.5° to +23.5°)</p>

However, the antenna can actually be half the wavelength, and amateur radio astronomers have had good results listening to all kinds of Jovian sounds, including detecting occultations of its many moons as they produce change in frequency due to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Doppler shift</a> when passing in front of it, amplification due to echo of Jupiter's own radio wave signature when close beside it from the observer's vantage point, and other effects causing radio wave frequency and amplitude changes with a simple dual dipole array that might look something like this:</p>

<p>Now this dual dipole antenna is more or less a simple two-piece of roughly half the wavelength of coaxial cable, stripped of insulation at the dipole ends and run dipoles parallel to each other at roughly 6.1 meters (20 ft) apart suspended over PVC masts. That is perfectly acceptable for nearly any amateur radio astronomer in both space and the price of the parts needed. There are also ways to help oneself with a lot smaller antenna, which I'll mention a bit later. Let's first clear the frequency range discussion with this really informative quote from <a href=""http://receiverforjupiter.tripod.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Radio Receiver for Jupiter</a> webpage (based on NASA's <a href=""http://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Radio JOVE project</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The peak of Jupiter signals occur around 10 MHz. Still this frequency
  is not that suitable, as it is very near to Ionospheric cutoff. The
  best suitable frequencies are in between 18 to 22 MHz, as the chances
  of getting emissions are more. In practice 18.7 MHz, 20.1 MHz, 22.3
  MHz are common. The frequencies above 30 MHz are not suitable because
  of less strength. The frequency of 20.1 MHz is used for this project,
  as the probability of getting emission is high. So the entire receiver
  is designed considering 20.1 MHz as the operating frequency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Antenna is of course merely one part of the story. Second thing that is required is the receiver. NASA is sponsoring <a href=""http://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Radio JOVE project</a> with an assembly manual for roughly 100 electronic components and pieces of hardware worth <em>RJ1.1 Receiver</em> (<em>Radio Jove 1.1 Receiver</em>) that can be almost completely assembled out of parts ordered from Radio Shack (it even includes RS part numbers). I'll add a photograph and a few other links, and you'll have to be on your own then:</p>

  <p>For my home observatory, I started with the Radio Jove receiver from NASA’s Radio Jove Project. This was a fairly easy-to-build kit with great directions, not just for the receiver but also the antenna setup and installation.  Unfortunately, I don’t have enough space to put up a phased antenna array.  Also, I’m bordered by power lines on the north and south sides of my property.   Also, since I’m in an urban area, I knew that I’d pick up a lot of noise.   Not to worry.   Solar observations are also quite interesting, and since the Sun is such a good signal source (especially so far this year), I opted for an antenna in my attic.</p>

  <p>This website contains the Technical details of the antenna and receiver used for receiving natural radio emissions from Jupiter at 20.1MHz. The antenna and receiver discussed in this site is based on the design given by NASA Radio Jove Program. 
  Natural radio emissions from Jupiter or from Sun are detected by using a dual dipole array as an antenna and with a sensitive receiver. The RF voltage developed at the antenna terminals is amplified with the RF amplifier and converted in to audio frequencies using a mixer. The audio signal thus generated is recorded on PC through a sound card in ‘wav’ format. Also a strip-chart recorder software is available to generate the strip-chart of data coming through sound card.</p>

<p>So there are indeed many ways to build your own antenna and receiver out of affordable and easily obtainable electronic parts, and some of these websites listed above will help you through the process of self-assembly, even providing some tricks how to do it easier, like for example assembling a smaller, in-house antenna array.</p>

<p>Now, one other thing that all these websites mention is also using various PC software that lets you analyze through computer's sound card received Jovian radio sounds, but since there's many different and free solutions out there, including NASA's own that runs on Windows PCs, I'll let you discover those on your own. <a href=""http://receiverforjupiter.tripod.com/softwares.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's one page</a> listing many links, to get you started.

<blockquote>
  <p>Chorus consists of brief, rising-frequency tones that sound like the chorus of birds singing at sunrise, hence the name ""chorus"" or ""dawn chorus."" Chorus at Earth is generated by electrons in Earth's Van Allen radiation belts. Once generated, the chorus waves affect the motions of the electrons through a process called a wave-particle interaction. Wave-particle interactions disturb the trajectories of the radiation belt electrons and cause the electrons to hit the upper atmosphere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The emissions we can hear are often referred to as decametric noise storms, because the waves are tens of meters long. Okay, it is possible to hear Jupiter from 15 to 38 MHz, but what are the optimal frequencies?  The consensus seems to be that 18 MHz up to about 28 MHz is a good place to listen.  A good rule would be to pick the lowest frequency in this range which was not being hindered by ionospheric refraction. </p>

Although they are electromagnetic waves, they occur at audio frequencies, and can be converted to audio using a suitable receiver. They are produced by lightning strokes (mostly intracloud and return-path) where the impulse travels along the Earth's magnetic field lines from one hemisphere to the other.<br /><br /><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRdKF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Auroral radio emissions from giant planets with plasma sources such as Jupiter's volcanic moon Io could be detected with radio telescopes.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>And so on. The last two on the list are probably a bit of a stretch for amateur astronomers, with auroral radio emissions average frequency range at 100 to 500 kHz, and whistlers cutoff at usually around 30 kHz, and both requiring too big antennae, but I wouldn't bet against it being possible with smaller antennae either, although bow frequency cutoffs might prevent identification of actual <em>aural</em> events. But there are many other sounds to listen to both from Jupiter, as well as it's many moons, mostly though the bigger and closer ones.</p>

"If dark matter bends light, how do we know the stuff in the sky is where we think it is?","3739","","<p>We measure movement, position, and many other things of an object in space because of its light and what we can measure with it. But as far as I know there's supposed to be a HUGE amount of dark matter in space whose mass and size we don't know, and because it has mass it has gravity and it can bend light.</p>

<p>I know physics can take into account the gravity of stars and huge stuff in space, but how can they be certain of any of their measurements (specially the position) if they don't know how that light has deviated from a straight line?  </p>
","<p>The local dark matter density is actually quite tiny, on the order of $\rho\sim10^{-19}\text{ g/cm}^3$ (see e.g. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4033"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bovy &amp; Tremaine (2012)</a>). This means that there is roughly $0.001$-$0.01M_{\odot}$ of dark matter per cubic parsec - a staggeringly small amount. 1000 cubic parsecs would contain about one solar mass of dark matter - and that's a cube 10 parsecs in length on each side! Now, the distribution of dark matter in galaxies is not homogeneous - it follows, roughly, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro%E2%80%93Frenk%E2%80%93White_profile"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Navarro-Frenk-White profile</a>, decreasing in density from the center of the galaxy - but on the scale of parsecs (and certainly <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/194107/56299"">in the Solar System</a>), we can consider it to have roughly uniform density.</p>

<p>On small scales, then, we have approximate homogeneity and low density. This means that any gravitational lensing effects from dark matter should be extremely low or self-cancelling, arising only from inhomogeneities containing large clumps of dark matter. However, such clumps are unlikely to form solely through dark matter's interaction with itself (if we discount the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_compact_halo_object"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MACHO</a> hypothesis, which, as far as I know, is not currently favored).</p>

<p>On intergalactic scales, however, dark matter <em>can</em> have some effects. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_gravitational_lensing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Weak lensing</a> is a commonly-observed phenomenon in galaxy clusters, which may have extremely high fractions of dark matter. There are several techniques currently used to model the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy (see the <a href=""http://www.astro.ipm.ir/ISGLT08/Lecture3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KSB+ method</a>) and to reconstruct the image and position of the original galaxy via <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconvolution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">deconvolution</a> (see <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612094"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chantry &amp; Magain</a>; a visual example is given <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7381/fig_tab/nature10669_F1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). I'm not too familiar with either technique, though, so I can't give you a good overview.</p>

<p>Even large-scale lensing has large mass requirements. zephyr pointed out that the foreground object that created the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Cross"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Einstein cross</a> contained $\sim10^{10}M_{\odot}$ of dark matter (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.4175v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">van de Ven et al.

"Does our sun/solar system orbit around any other celestial objects?","3704","","<p>Does our solar system orbit around another massive celestial object? Like a massive star or black hole for instance? From my understanding our sun rotates around the centre of our galaxy, thus our solar system follows. But I'm curious to know if there is/are other(s) gravitational force(s) that affect our suns? Other than the rotation around the centre of the milky way.</p>

<p>It would make sense to me that the gravity of massive objects would affect our sun, which in turn would affect our solar system, but I cannot find any answers other than ones concerning the ""galactic year"".</p>
","<p>The orbit of the Sun around the Galaxy is quite complicated, because unlike the solar system, the mass is not completely concentrated at the centre. So, in addition to the roughly circular 230 million year orbit in the plane of the Galaxy, there are superimposed motions in and out of the plane and towards and away from the Galactic centre. These roughly sinusoidal additional motions, called epicycles, do not have large amplitudes - a few hundred light years - and take about 70 million and 160 million years respectively.</p>

<p>The Sun does not systematically orbit any other Galactic structures or stars (see the flagged potential duplicates for more details - there is no evidence for any binary companion to the Sun larger than a few Jupiter masses)  and is unlikely to do so in the forseeable future. The space between the stars in our Galaxy is large enough that they are essentially non-interacting.</p>

<p>The Galaxy itself is in motion with respect to the galaxies around it. The nearest tens of galaxies form the local group and probably have complicated orbits within their summed gravitational potential. These orbits cannot be precisely determined, because although we can measure line of sight velocities using the Doppler effect, the tangential motions require extraordinarily accurate position data over many years. These are now becoming available - for instance we know our Galaxy and M31 will collide in around 4 billion years.</p>

<p>Further afield, the local group is part of a larger galaxy aggregate, called the Virgo supercluster, but here, determining an orbit is impossible.</p>

<p>Even further, large galaxy clusters are arranged into a web of larger superclusters, voids and filaments that are all in motion with respect to each other.</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion out there between zodiac <em>constellations</em> (in astronomy) and zodiac <em>signs</em> (in astrology). From the research I've done so far (including the quote above), it seems as though one of them (Ophiuchus) is a ""recent addition"", possibly due to the Earth's precession since ancient times (<a href=""http://io9.com/5733004/your-zodiac-sign-may-have-changed-this-week"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>). </p>

<p>What (officially?) are the <em>constellations</em> of the astronomical zodiac? 
Why do some sources list 12 and others list 13? </p>
","<p>There are thirteen <em>modern</em> constellations in the Zodiac. In modern astronomy, a constellation is a specific area of the celestial sphere as defined by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union"" rel=""noreferrer"">International Astronomical Union</a>. In total, there are 88 constellations.</p>

<p>Astronomy and Astrology are not the same thing. Astronomy is a science while Astrology is not. As such, I'll restrict myself to the historical and modern constellations of the Zodiac.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/topic/zodiac"" rel=""noreferrer"">Encylopedia Brittanica</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zodiac (is) a belt around the heavens extending 9° on either side of the ecliptic, the plane of the earth’s orbit and of the sun’s apparent annual path. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In historical astronomy, the zodiac is a circle of twelve 30° divisions of celestial longitude that are centered upon the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the course of the year. Historically, each of these divisions were called signs and named after a constellation: Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, and Scorpius.</p>

<p>In 1930, the International Astronomical Union <a href=""http://www.southastrodel.com/Page207.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">defined the boundaries between the various constellations</a>, under <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Joseph_Delporte"" rel=""noreferrer"">Eugène Delporte </a>, who,</p>

<p>As a result, the path of the ecliptic now officially passes through thirteen constellations: the twelve traditional 'zodiac constellations' and Ophiuchus (which was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy), the bottom part of which interjects between Scorpio and Sagittarius. </p>

<p>So, the 13 constellations of the Zodiac are Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius and Ophiuchus. </p>

<p>As seen from the (first) figure, the ecliptic also touches the edge of the constellation Cetus, though it in not usually included in the Zodiacal constellations.</p>

<p>Note about Precession: Because the Earth in inclined (by $23.45^{\circ}$), it rotates like a top. This is called precession, which results in a shift in the position of the constellations relative to us on Earth. The result is that the 'Signs of the Zodiac' are off by about one month.</p>

"Are Barlow Lenses Good For Deep Sky Observing?","3645","","<p>I'm using a 750mm (focal length) by 150mm (aperture) newtonian reflector and I've been curious about using Barlow lenses on deep sky objects. </p>

<p>Some of the astronomers at my local observatory say that if you get the lens selection correct so you don't lose any light through the eyepiece, you don't need a Barlow lens. While others say that the Barlow lens doubling the focal length of the telescope allows me to see deep sky objects better than without it. </p>

<p>So, is a Barlow lens an effective tool for deep sky observing? If not, what should I use it for?</p>

<p>Note: I already have a 2x Barlow lens.</p>
","<p><strong>The Failures of High Magnification</strong></p>

<p>Higher magnification doesn't help you observe deep sky objects better. Deep sky objects unlike stars are extended objects. They subtend a finite solid angle on you. This ensures that the surface brightness(brightness per unit solid angle) of extended objects remains constant. Hence, a higher magnification would not make it brighter for you to see.</p>

<p>It is worse for another reason. After a certain magnification, the apparent angular size of the extended object becomes comparable to the field of view, or sometimes even greater. Your eye won't be able to distinguish the object against the background since most of the background is the object itself. </p>

<p><strong>Good Uses of Barlow</strong></p>

<p>Some of the uses that you can put your Barlow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Observe the Moon, Solar System objecs</li>
<li>Some of the clusters which seem like point objects really ""explode"" when using a Barlow. The best example is Omega Centauri.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Experiences</strong></p>

<p>I have a 8"" Dobsonian Newtonian Reflector. The viewfinder is 20x80. I really get a better picture of deep sky objects like Ring Nebula, which have a small angular size, when using Barlow. But for cases like Lagoon and Trifid Nebula; they are visible to me from my viewfinder but not through the eyepiece(even in the lowest magnification).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Barlow really helps if you have a deep sky object with small angular size. For larger objects, a binocular may do better, especially for city conditions.</p>

<p>This seems less easy to discern for amateur astronomers  in the case of the sun though. </p>

<p>Does the Sun also rotate as a by-product of it's creation? What evidence is there to support this? Does the sun have any discerning features that make it evident it is rotating?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_rotation"">Yes</a>.</p>

<p>It does not rotate uniformly though, different portions have a different angular velocity (as a body made of plasma, it can get away with this).</p>

<p>Measuring this in theory is pretty easy, we just need to track the motion of the sunspots. This isn't as simple as calculating the changes in relative positions of the sunspots, though, as the Earth is rotating and revolving, which makes the calculations harder. This measurement can be done using the celestial sphere (the field of stars that we see) as a ""fixed"" reference point and seeing how the Earth and the sunspots move relative to that.</p>

<p>Almost everything in the universe rotates/revolves, at least a little bit, because angular momentum is hard to get rid of. It can be transferred from body to body, but for a body to end up with zero angular momentum, it needs to meet another body with the exact same angular momentum and collide with it in a particular way. Given that this is pretty rare, all celestial bodies rotate.</p>

<p>In addition to that, a non rotating body that is revolving will eventually start spinning due to tidal forces.</p>

<p>I have always learned that planets don't flicker to the naked eye, only stars (indeed, every other time I've seen a planet it wasn't flickering), so I was rather confused. I even checked Stellarium to make sure that what I was seeing was, in fact, Venus.</p>

<p>Does anybody have an explanation for that behaviour?</p>

<p>Thank you all.</p>
","<p>Because planets actually do twinkle. Most people were told that the major difference between stars and planets is that only the former twinkle - but that's an oversimplification. Given the right conditions, planets will twinkle too, it just happens more rarely.</p>

<p>Several factors that contribute to it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>lots of air turbulence; or, as astronomers call it, ""bad seeing""</p></li>
<li><p>closeness to horizon; if the planets are high in the sky, the air column is shorter so there's less chance they will twinkle; but when they are low, their light goes through more air and so it is perturbed to a larger degree</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The observation you've made, Venus twinkling, is not very unusual. Many stargazers are used to seeing that once in a while. I've seen Venus scintillate several times in the past, always at sunset when it was about to drop below horizon; I would presume you could see the same behavior very early in the morning as Venus has just risen.</p>

","<p>A quasar is a type of AGN. Its main property is that it's galaxy axis points towards the earth and this way we receive its light and radio signals.

","<p>The largest main belt asteroid is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_%28dwarf_planet%29"">1 Ceres</a>, which alone contains almost a third of the total mass of the whole main asteroid belt.</p>

<p>Ceres is large enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e. its own gravity is strong enough to pull it into a roughly spherical shape.  Since the mass of a spherical planet scales as the cube of the diameter (assuming constant density), piling all the other main belt asteroids together onto Ceres would only increase its diameter by a bit under 50%.  It would still be a roughly similar type of body &mdash; a small sphere of partially differentiated rock and ice, with no atmosphere to speak of (as it'd be way too small to hold onto one).</p>

"Where does the Solar System end?","3493","","<p>This is a question I've heard many times in the past, and a quick search of the site says it hasn't been asked here, so I figured I might as well ask (and answer) it. I know that it is rare for someone to ask and answer their own question, but I think it could work here, and I welcome input (including other answers) from anyone and everyone here.</p>

<p>The Sun is roughly 4 light-years away from the closest star system, the Alpha Centauri system. The planets in our Solar System, however, aren't even close to that far away from the Sun. Where does our Solar System end? Is the edge considered to be the orbit of Neptune, the Kuiper Belt, the Oort Cloud, or something else?</p>

<p>Note: <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/25784/how-big-is-the-solar-system"">this</a> question on Physics SE is similar, but the answers posted here go in different directions.</p>
","<p>According to the Case Western Reserve University webpage <a href=""http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/solarsystem_edge.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Edge of the Solar System</a> (2006) an important consideration is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The whole concept of an ""edge"" is somewhat inaccurate as far as the solar system is concerned, for there is no physical boundary to it - there is no wall past which there's a sign that says, ""Solar System Ends Here."" There are, however, specific regions of space that include outlying members of our solar system, and a region beyond-which the Sun can no longer hold any influence. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last part of that definition appears to be a viable definition of the edge of the solar system.  Specifically, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>valid boundary region for the ""edge"" of the solar system is the heliopause. This is the region of space where the sun's solar wind meets that of other stars. It is a fluctuating boundary that is estimated to be approximately 17.6 billion miles (120 A.U.) away. Note that this is within the Oort Cloud.</p>

"How does moonrise/moonset azimuth vary with time?","3488","","<p>In my tenacious attempts to observe moonrise (surprisingly difficult in a poor weather heavily urbanized hilly area with frequent bad smog, with busy work schedule and a bicycle) I was frequently trying to find good observation spots that would provide view to open distant horizon at specific azimuth.</p>

<p>While generally similar moon phases correlated with similar moonrise times I found the azimuth to vary in a way I have a difficult time to put my finger on. Sure there's a <em>roughly</em> monthly cycle of ""wobble"" between deviating about +/- 30 degrees north or south from ""pure east"" but while the mechanics of correlation between hour when the Moon is visible from behind the horizon and the degree it's lit by the sun are quite clear to me, the way its - or is it Earth's? - orbital plane is ""off"" relative to the ecliptic plane and Earth rotation plane eludes me. Could someone provide a sort of guide - preferably something that acts more as help in understanding the mechanics, as opposed to providing raw mathematical solutions, what does this deviation depend on, and how it changes with time?</p>
","<p>The monthly variations are caused by the change in declination of the Moon as it travels (roughly) along the ecliptic.  This is caused by the tilt of the Earth's rotation axis, which results in an angle of about 23&deg; between the equator (declination = 0&deg;) and the ecliptic.  Around the constellations of Taurus and Gemini the ecliptic lies at much higher declination than near Saggitarius or Ophiuchus.  The same effect causes the change in rise and set times of the Sun during a year.</p>

<p>When you're in the northern hemisphere, a higher declination means that the transit altitude of the Moon or Sun is higher.  In fact, their whole daily (apparent - caused by the Earth's rotation) paths lie closer to the North star.  Because of that, the points where a daily path intersects with your local horizon lie further north, which you see as a change in rise/set azimuth of the Moon.</p>

<p>All this is true even without the 5&deg; inclination of the Moon's orbit w.r.t. the ecliptic.  That inclination only mitigates the effect; the Moons declination does not exactly vary between -23 and +23&deg; every month, but these extreme values themselves can lie between +/-18&deg; or +/-28&deg;, depending on whether the inclination effect increases (23+5&deg;) or decreases (23-5&deg;) the effect of the motion along the ecliptic.</p>

<p>Lastly, the rise/set azimuths do not correlate to lunar phase, as do the rise/set times.  Both phases and rise/set times are defined based on the Sun's position; we roughly define ""noon"" as the moment when the Sun is transiting in the south, and call the Moon ""New"" when it's in the same direction as the Sun, so there's no wonder that the New Moon transits around noon.  This is not true for the effects described above, and hence the corresponding periods are different.  The mean lunar period between twice the same equinox point (e.g. Aries) is called the Tropical month and lasts ~27.3d (this is roughly the same as the siderial month, but influenced by precession).  The effect of the inclination of the Moon's orbit has a mean period of one Draconic month, with a period of ~27.2d.  Instead, the Synodic month, the mean period between two cases of New Moon, lasts 29.5d, about 2.2d longer.  Hence, the declination and rise/set azimuths of the Moon do not correlate with the phases. </p>

"Do solstices and equinoxes shift over time?","3370","","<p>Right now, I think the winter solstice is around December 21. Has it always been around this date constantly?</p>

<p>Since the earth's axis's 23.45° tilt will be on the exact opposite side in 13000 years (or was 13000 years ago) due to precession, it'd seem like the seasons would flip every 13000 years. So, +/- 13000 years from now, it would've turned summer around December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere, right?</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar"" rel=""nofollow"">Gregorian Calendar</a> was created so that annual astronomical events, specifically the vernal equinox (used to determine when Easter is), would on average keep their places in the calendar year over time.  It is the best official approximation to the definition of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year"" rel=""nofollow"">tropical year</a>, which is defined as ""the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position in the cycle of seasons"".  Because this calendar describes 97 leap years out of every 400 years, it defines the average year as exactly 365.2425 solar days, or exactly 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 12 seconds.</p>

<p>However, the mean tropical year is in reality about 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds, or 27 seconds shorter.</p>

<p>Because the Gregorian Calendar is based on the tropical year, the calendar dates of the year will keep up with the solstices and equinoxes, and thus the seasons.  If this calendar were exactly the length of the tropical year, then the calendar would keep the vernal (northward) equinox around March 20th for all time.</p>

<p>But because of the slight inaccuracy, it will take about 3,200 years (60 s/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day / 27 s/year) for these 27 seconds to add up every year to be 1 full day, and that will result in the solstices and equinoxes marching backwards in the calendar by 1 day every 3,200 years or so, depending on the accuracy of the 27 seconds difference.  This very slow shift is due to the slight inaccuracy in the Gregorian calendar in, on average, matching the tropical year, not because of the precession of the equinoxes.</p>

<p>3,200 years from now, if the Gregorian Calendar is still used, the date of the vernal (northward) equinox will be on average one day earlier in March.  The precession of the equinoxes will still occur, so the Earth's axis tilt will be significantly different from today.  The Earth will be at a noticeably different position with respect to the Sun on the vernal (northward) equinox from where it is today, in 2014, on the vernal (northward) equinox, but it will still be in March.</p>

<p>This inaccuracy may very slowly increase over time, because according to the same Wikipedia page for the tropical year, the tropical year is very slowly getting shorter, and the mean solar day is even more slowly getting longer.  But for 10,000 years to come, the Gregorian Calendar will keep the vernal (northward) equinox in March, even if it slowly shifts earlier in the month.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to the scenario that you imply, where the calendar date would correspond to the relative position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun.  That describes the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year"" rel=""nofollow"">sidereal year</a>, the time taken for the Sun to reach the same spot in the sky relative to the stars, which is 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and 10 seconds.  A sidereal calendar would explain why you might think that precession would cause the dates of equinoxes and solstices to change in the calendar year.  That would result in a shift in the calendar of one full month in 1/12th the cycle length of the precession of the equinoxes, or about 1 full month about every 2,000 years.</p>

","<p>Well without your big brother jupiter looking out for poor little earth then life on earth wouldn't be possible (most likely, but definitely not intelligent life as it has taken us millions of years to evolve to this point, and meteor collisions would increase at an alarming rate).

""But Jupiter is so much bigger than earth how could its gravity be negligible?""  Well the intensity of gravity is proportional to 1/distance^2 (one over distance squared) so the farther you are away from something the less gravitational effect it has on you, and earth is big enough that it is most likely the only gravitational effect your body will ever truly be aware of. However you can see the tidal effects caused by the moon. High tide low tide are created by the moon's gravity.

<p>Almost. Theia did not have to be co-orbiting, just an intersecting orbit.

<p>The fact that Mars and Earth have such a similar period is a coincidence, perhaps you are asking why Mars is spinning so fast? Well actually Mars is not the odd man out, Mercury and Venus are. Most planets spin fast. exactly which spin orientation is somewhat arbitrarily determined by the vagaries of the ways the planetesimals collided to form them. The fact that Venus and Uranus have unusual spin <em>orientations</em> is just the way things turned out.</p>

<p>Both Mercury and Venus used to spin much faster. Mercury's spin was tidally slowed down by the Sun <em>and</em> Mercury's orbit was (and still is being) driven further away by the Sun (just like the Moon and Earth: <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/420/why-is-the-moon-receding-from-the-earth-due-to-tides-is-this-typical-for-other"">Why is the Moon receding from the Earth due to tides?

<p>The tidal <em>force</em> from the sun is much much less for Venus than for Mercury, but much more than for Earth. <em>However</em> Venus has a dense hot <em>massive</em> atmosphere, which can be forced into both gravitational bi-modal (two peaks) tides and thermal uni-modal (one peak) tides. The bulge lags behind the tidal forcing peak, which creates a torque by the sun to slow it down.

","<p>Just to address some of the potential confusion in the original question:</p>

<p>Talking about ""resolution"" in ""megapixels"" only makes sense if you're comparing different imaging chips in the <em>same optical system</em>: the same angular field of view, with the same angular resolution limit, imaged onto the chip. So comparing megapixels between, say, different full-frame DSLRs (or full-frame mirrorless cameras) makes sense, because if you put the same size lens on a full-frame Nikon or Canon DSLR, they image same field of view onto their chips, with similar if not identical angular resolution limits.</p>

<p>This comparison breaks down if you try to compare even the same camera with different lenses, because then the field of view imaged onto the chip changes. For example, I can put a wide-angle lens (large field of view) on a full-frame DSLR and take a picture of a lion at a distance. I'll get a great landscape picture, but if I zoom in on the lion in the resulting image, the lion will be blurry, with only a few pixels covering the lion. I can put long telephoto lens (small field of view) on the <em>exact same camera</em>, take a picture of the lion, and the lion will be very detailed and sharp, spanning lots of pixels (though I won't get the rest of the lanscape).</p>

<p>Many claims about megapixels in consumer and phone cameras, while technically correct, are mostly marketing blather, because there's no attempt to compare the fields of view and thus the effective angular resolution. This is why you'll be able to take much higher resolution images with a 20-megapixel DSLR than you can take with your 41-megapixel phone camera.</p>

<p>Another way to think about it is this: if we could put whatever chip the Lumia uses in Hubble, would we get sharper images? No. The Lumia chip has <em>physically</em> smaller pixels -- probably something like 1 to 1.5 microns in size, compared to the 21 micron ACS-HRC pixels. But, as Rob Jeffries points out, the HRC pixels are already small enough to resolve at Hubble's angular resolution limit. The Lumia chip wouldn't show any more <em>detail</em> than the HRC chip already does, it would just give you bigger blur per pixel. (There's also the fact that commercial imaging chips divide their pixels up between different filters to get R, G, and B images simultaneously, so in practice your ""41 megapixel"" camera only records about 13 or 14 megapixels per filter. Cameras on Hubble don't use per-pixel filters, so each single-filter image uses all the pixels.)</p>

"How large can a ball of water be without fusion starting?","3200","","<p>How large can a ball of water be without fusion starting?</p>

<p>Peculiar question: some explanation might be necessary. My young son is into ‘space’ and astronomy. One of his posters says that Saturn could float, if a sufficiently large ocean could be found. Obviously that wouldn’t work: Saturn’s atmosphere would peel off and join or become the atmosphere of the larger body, and then Saturn’s dense core would sink.  </p>

<p>But could such an ocean even exist without fusion starting?</p>
","<p>You really need a full-blown stellar evolution model to answer this precisely and I'm not sure anyone would ever have done this with an oxygen-dominated star.</p>

<p>To zeroth order the answer will be the similar to a metal-rich star - i.e. about 0.075 times the mass of the Sun. Any less than this and the brown dwarf (for that is what we call a star that never gets hot enough at its centre to initiate significant fusion) can be supported by electron degeneracy pressure.</p>

<p>A star/brown dwarf with the composition you suggest would be a different.  The composition would be thoroughly and homogeneously mixed by convection. Note that other than a thin layer near the surface, the water would be completely dissociated and the hydrogen and oxygen atoms completely ionised. Hence the density of protons in the core would be lower for the same mass density than in a ""normal star"".  However, the temperature dependence is so steep I think this would be a minor factor and nuclear fusion would be significant at a similar temperature.</p>

<p>Of much greater importance is that there would be fewer electrons and fewer particles at the same density. This decreases both the electron degeneracy pressure and normal gas pressure at a given mass density. 
The star is therefore able to contract to much smaller radii before degeneracy pressure becomes important and can thus reach higher temperatures for the same mass as a result.</p>

<p>For that reason I think that the minimum mass for hydrogen fusion of a ""water star"" would be <em>smaller</em> than for a star made mainly of hydrogen.</p>

<p>But how much smaller? Back of the envelop time! </p>

<p>Use the virial theorem to get a relationship between perfect gas pressure and the temperature, mass and radius of a star. Let gravitational potential energy be $\Omega$, then the virial theorem says</p>

<p>$$ \Omega = -3 \int P \ dV$$</p>

<p>If we only have a perfect gas then $P = \rho kT/\mu m_u$, where $T$ is the temperature, $\rho$ the mass density, $m_u$ an atomic mass unit and $\mu$ the average number of mass units per particle in the gas.</p>

<p>Assuming a constant density star (back of the envelope) then $dV = dM/\rho$, where $dM$ is a mass shell and $\Omega = -3GM^2/5R$, where $R$ is the ""stellar"" radius. Thus
$$\frac{GM^2}{5R} = \frac{kT}{\mu m_u} \int dM$$
$$ T = \frac{GM \mu m_u}{5k R}$$
and so the central temperature $T \propto \mu MR^{-1}$.</p>

<p>Now what we do is say that the star contracts until at this temperature, the phase space occupied by its electrons is $\sim h^3$ and electron degeneracy becomes important.</p>

<p>A standard treatment of this is to say that the physical volume occupied by an electron is $1/n_e$, where $n_e$ is the electron number density and that the momentum volume occupied is $\sim (6m_e kT)^{3/2}$. The electron number density is related to the mass density by $n_e = \rho /\mu_e m_u$, where $\mu_e$ is the number of mass units per electron. For ionised hydrogen $\mu_e=1$, but for oxygen $\mu_e=2$ (all the gas would be ionised near the temperatures for nuclear fusion). The average density $\rho = 3M/4\pi R^3$.</p>

<p>Putting these things together we get
$$h^3 = \frac{ (6m_e kT)^{3/2}}{n_e} = \frac{4\pi \mu_e}{3}\left(\frac{6 \mu}{5}\right)^{3/2} (Gm_e R)^{3/2} m_u^{5/2} M^{1/2}$$<br>
Thus the radius to which the star contracts in order for degeneracy pressure to be important is
$$ R \propto \mu_e^{-2/3} \mu^{-1} M^{-1/3}$$</p>

<p>If we now substitute this into the expression for central temperature, we find
$$ T \propto \mu M \mu_e^{2/3} \mu M^{1/3} \propto \mu^2 \mu_e^{2/3} M^{4/3}$$</p>

<p>Finally, if we argue that the temperature for fusion is the same in a ""normal"" star and our ""water star"", then the mass at which fusion will occur is given by the proportionality
$$ M \propto \mu^{-3/2} \mu_e^{-1/2}$$ .</p>

<p>For a normal star with a hydrogen/helium mass ratio of 75:25, then $\mu \simeq 16/27$ and $\mu_e \simeq 8/7$.  For a ""water star"",  $\mu = 18/11$ and $\mu_e= 9/5$. Thus if the former set of parameters leads to a minimum mass for fusion of $0.075 M_{\odot}$, then by increasing $\mu$ and $\mu_e$ this becomes smaller by the appropriate factor $(18\times 27/11\times 16)^{-3/2} (9\times 7/5\times 8)^{-1/2} = 0.173$.</p>

<p>Thus a water star would undergo H fusion at $0.013 M_{\odot}$ or about 13 times the mass of Jupiter!</p>

<p>NB This only deals with hydrogen fusion. The small amount of deuterium would fuse at lower temperatures. A similar analysis would give a minimum mass for this to occur of about 3 Jupiter masses.</p>

<p>So, what is the furthest object visible to the naked eye in the night sky from the surface of the earth? Assume a person with good eyes, on a clear, dry night at sea level, away from bright lights.</p>
","<p>This is partly a question of 'limiting magnitude' - the faintest magnitude that is visible using a particular instrument, or in this case, just the eye.</p>

<p>+6 - maybe +6.5  - magnitude is sometimes used as a baseline expectation of what can be seen in dark skies sites.</p>

<p>The most distant star <a href=""http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/how-far-away-is-the-farthest-star.html"">that can easily be seen</a> is Deneb. It is actually quite bright, at brighter than +2 Magnitude, but is (probably) 1425ly away. So though it is at quite some distance, it's luminosity means that actually, it isn't limiting magnitude that is at play.</p>

<p>There are stars much further away that are at the barely perceivable limit, and seeing them will depend on conditions. The +4 mag mu Cephei is probably fairly achievable, at 5900ly, and <a href=""http://astrobob.areavoices.com/2010/10/02/how-to-see-the-farthest-thing-you-can-see/"">V762 in Cassiopeia</a> is about +6 mag and maybe 16000ly, which would probably be the record if you can actually see it, but you'll need special conditions.</p>

<p>When it comes to galaxies, Andromeda is 2500000ly away, and +3.4, very visible and much further away than any individual star. If you have good conditions, the +5.7 mag M33 is slightly further away at 2900000ly, but it would be much harder to see.</p>

<p>While the generally accepted limit is maybe +6.5, some people claim to have seen to +8. If it is possible, M83 is 14700000ly away at +8.2, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_galaxies#Naked-eye_galaxies"">with naked-eye claims reported</a>.</p>

<p>No. The law of conservation of angular momentum prevents this for a planet with reasonable inner structure in a gravitational field like that around the sun.</p>

<p>The angular momentum of the planet points in a certain direction. Changing this direction requires a torque perpendicular to the rotation axis.</p>

<p>If a torque existed that could force the rotation axis of the planet to always point towards the sun, the corresponding force had to have a component perpendicular to the line from the sun to the planet. The force also had to change periodically with the orbit of the planet. Obviously such a force does not exist in the planet-sun-system.</p>

"what planet is the most radioactive?","3137","","<p>So as I understand it the source of most geothermal energy on Earth is due to radioactive decay. Jupiter is the most massive planet but if the bulk of it's mass comes from gaseous elements instead of heavier ones like uranium or whatever than it being the most massive might not necessarily mean it has the most radioactive material.</p>
","<p>There's a few parts to this question, I'll give it a shot.  Also, since you're asking about the geothermal energy of the earth, I'm going to ignore radiation from space and radioactive van allen belts (Jupiter has a very radioactive van Allen belt).   Also, as voyager discovered when it left the solar system, there's more radiation in the form of cosmic rays out there, that the sun effectively shields most of the planets from.   </p>

<p>But, because you mention the Earth's geothermal heat from radiation, so I'll focus on that.</p>

<p>Here's a very well answered similar question about radioactive elements inside the earth.  <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/4798/what-percent-of-the-earths-core-is-uranium"">what percentage of the Earth's core is Uranium</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So as I understand it the source of most geothermal energy on Earth is

<p>A healthy share of Earth's core heat is from the planets formation.  This is a pretty good article on that subject - <a href=""http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/jul/19/radioactive-decay-accounts-for-half-of-earths-heat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/jul/19/radioactive-decay-accounts-for-half-of-earths-heat</a>, it says that of the current heat, about 50% is from the energy left from the formation of the planet and about 50% is from radiation - so the radiation is very important, but it's probably not the cause of ""most"" of the heat in the earth.</p>

<p>As far as I know, no similar studies have been done on any of the other planets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jupiter is the most massive planet but if the bulk of it's mass comes
  from gaseous elements instead of heavier ones like uranium or whatever
  than it being the most massive might not necessarily mean it has the
  most radioactive material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That I pretty much agree with.  The two primary differences between the 4 gas giant planets (or, two gas giant, two ice giants if you like) and the 4 inner rocky planets is that the gas giants formed outside the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_%28astrophysics%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">frost line</a> and key difference #2, the 4 outer planets are much larger, so they were more able to hold onto more hydrogen and helium, which are the 2 most abundant elements in the solar system.</p>

<p>Obviously, the 4 outer planets have a lower percentage of heavy elements overall.    As to their percentage of Uranium - well, your guess is as good as mine, but, probably a lower percentage of radioactive elements than the inner planets seems reasonable to assume.</p>

<p>Also, any radioactive elements in the 4 outer planets would likely be well below their thick gaseous surfaces, so it would be difficult to detect, outside of Neutrino detection I suppose, and more trouble than it's worth to try to collect.</p>

<p>The 4 inner planets (and lets throw the moon in there as well, and asteroids if you like) are more interesting I'm assuming David Hammen's answer is correct in the linked question above, and that most of the Uranium on earth is in the crust or mantle, the highest percentage in the crust, and so that's probably true for any other rocky planet that formed and was, at one time, molten enough to circulate, so all the inner planets probably have similarly small amounts of uranium and other radioactive elements as Earth.</p>

<p>Mercury may have had much of it's crust and some of it's mantle blown off in a giant collision, and if that's the case, Mercury might have lost a portion of it's radioactive elements.  Brief summary of that here, point #6:  <a href=""http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/faq/faq_science.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/faq/faq_science.html</a></p>

<p>unrelated footnote, but if Mercury's crust was blown off, it might be a good planet to mine for rare earth elements, or maybe asteroids will be easier, who knows, but I've always been curious of the mining possibilities on Mercury.  Abundant solar energy too, but it's a hard planet to fly to because of the sun's gravity, so, maybe asteroids are the way to go for space mining.</p>

<p>The moon was also formed by a giant impact, so, the moon was formed by material from Earth's but it has a much higher percentage of mantle than the Earth, so it could have a higher percentage of Uranium and other radioactive elements than the earth.  How well the Moon's material was circulated in it's cooling process is another question.   Being smaller it probably cooled more quickly. </p>

<p>Venus and Mars, I see no reason why they shouldn't have similar percentages of radioactive elements than Earth.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RQN7S.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> Source:  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_structure_of_the_Moon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_structure_of_the_Moon</a>  </p>

<p>One way to look at this question is to investigate how quickly the other inner planets cooled.  Far from exact, but that probably tells us something, since heat generated by radioactive decay inside the planet would probably lead to volcanism at some point.  Even the Moon appears to have had volcanic eruptions as recently as 33 million years ago, so some ongoing internal heating seems likely.</p>

<p><a href=""http://news.discovery.com/space/imps-reveal-volcanoes-erupted-recently-on-the-moon-141014.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Volcanoes on the moon</a></p>

<p>Size is also a key factor in what keeps the inside of a planet hot, and in some cases, tidal heating (Io, Enceladus), but that's not really relevant to this question.   </p>

<p>Neither Mars nor Venus are volcanically active like the earth, but Olympus Mons may have erupted as recently as 25 million years ago, and there is evidence of large lava flows on Venus.   As to how big a role radioactivity plays in heating up the cores of those 2 planets, I don't know precisely how much.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good question on planet cores and radioactivity, as the inside of the planet is just as interesting as the surface, well, to me, at least.   I know this doesn't answer your question specifically as to which is the most radioactive, cause I don't know, but I like the question.</p>

"How long until we cannot see any stars from other galaxies?","3105","","<p>Since all the galaxies are moving further away from each other at a faster and faster rate, eventually we won't be able to see stars from other galaxies. How long until we can't see stars from other galaxies?</p>
","<p>First of all, we can't see stars from other galaxies (with a few exceptions, Cepheid variable stars for example are regularly used to determine distances to nearby galaxies). As it currently stands, we can only see stars from our own Milky Way (in which I'm including the large and small Magellanic Clouds). Type Ia supernovae aside, it might be possible to see Cepheid variables in the Andromeda galaxy, but anything further is almost certainly not possible.   </p>

<p>The relevant number when it comes to the distance one could possibly see in the universe is the comoving distance to the cosmological horizon. This horizon defines the boundary between what can be seen and what cannot be seen, simply because the universe is not old enough for particles to have traveled that far (yes, even at the speed of light; in fact, if we're talking about what we can <em>observe</em>, the photon is the particle we care about).</p>

<p>The definition of the comoving distance is:</p>

<p>$$\chi = \frac{c}{H_{0}} \int_{z=0}^{z=z_{Hor}} \frac{dz^{'}}{E(z^{'})}$$</p>

<p>where the function $$ E(z^{'}) $$ contains your choice of cosmology (the following is for flat universes only):</p>

<p>$$E(z^{'}) = \sqrt{ \Omega_{\gamma} (1+z)^{4} + \Omega_{m} (1+z)^{3} + \Omega_{\Lambda} }$$</p>

<p>This distance can be extrapolated out into the future (given your choice of cosmology), and ultimately will tell you what the distance to the <em>cosmological event horizon</em> will asymptotically reach. This is the distance at which no object beyond could ever come into causal contact with you. </p>

<p>Another <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_horizon"" rel=""nofollow"">simpler</a> way to calculate the particle horizon is to calculate the conformal time that has passed from the beginning of the universe, and multiply it by the speed of light $c$, where the conformal time is defined in the following way:</p>

<p>$$\eta = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{dt^{'}}{a(t^{'})}$$</p>

<p>where $a(t^{'})$ is the scale factor of the universe, and its relationship to time depends specifically on your choice of cosmology. Again, if the ultimate value of this horizon is desired, you would need to integrate this to infinity. </p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>: I'm having a hard time finding the exact number of the comoving size of the cosmological event horizon, though I'll keep searching. If I can't find it I suppose I'll have to do the calculation when I have some free time. Almost certainly it is larger than the size of the local group of galaxies, making our night sky largely safe from the fate of the universe. Anything further than this horizon, however, will monotonically become both fainter and redder. I also think that it does asymptotically reach some value, rather than eventually increasing infinitely or decreasing passed some point in time. I'll have to get back to you on that.  </p>

"Most important feature of a telescope","3054","","<p>I was taking an astronomy test, the following question came up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important function of the astronomical telescope is:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Resolving power</li>
  <li>Light gathering power</li>
  <li>magnifying power</li>
  <li>focal length</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The focal length obviously means nothing here, as well as the magnification (that can always be done later). As far as resolving power and light gathering power go though, they both seem to be ""equally"" important, in that without the first, there is no detail, and without the second, there is no image.</p>

<p>It does seem that exposure time can compensate for a lack of light gathering power (what matters is the product between the two), but nothing can compensate for resolving power.</p>

<p>My professor seems to think the answer is resolving power. Why is this? Is this some well known idea in astronomy?</p>
","<p>Well the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"" rel=""nofollow"">angular resolution</a> of a telescope depends on two things: 1) The wavelength of light you're looking in, and 2) the diameter of the primary lens/mirror. </p>

<p>$$ \theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}$$</p>

<p>where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the lens.</p>

<p>Light collecting power is simply how many photons you can collect in a particular wavelength in a given amount of time. Essentially, the bigger the bucket (or lens/mirror), the more rain you can catch. You can sort of get around light collecting power by increasing your exposure time. But, if the size of the object you're trying to observe is smaller than your telescope's resolving power, I don't believe there is really much you can do about it. Being limited by the resolution of your telescope is called being <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system"" rel=""nofollow"">diffraction limited</a>, but most telescopes on Earth are usually seeing limited due to the atmosphere's smearing effects.</p>

<p>From what I know, the number of stars I can see should be far less ( I don't know why, though). Is it true? If yes, why?</p>
","<p>The numbers you're quoting are extreme, more like a theoretical limit, and meaningless in practice.</p>

<p>The 44k number would be true if you assume a limiting magnitude of 8. There aren't many people alive today who have seen at least one object at mag +8. This is not so much due to vision problems (although that may be important for some people), as to the fact that a mag +8 sky is an incredibly rare occurrence today due to light pollution.</p>

<p>If you live on a continent with a low population density (such as North America, Australia, or the remote parts of Asia), then yes, maybe you have a chance of catching a mag +8 sky - if you drive far out into the desert, many hours away from any city or town. But if you live in Europe or the like, forget it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, the 44k number is obtained by assuming the mag 8 conditions, and then counting all known objects in the sky whose brightness exceeds that limit. It is very unlikely that any one person would see them all in one lifetime. Seeing even a single star at mag 8 can be a difficult undertaking for many people, even in ideal conditions.</p>

<p>It is very hard to quote a number, since it is so much dependent on light pollution, transparency, visual acuity of the observer (nearsighted people can't focus well enough to see very faint stars), the observer's age (acuity gets worse with age), the observer's experience (visual astronomers with years of experience will be able to see much fainter stars because <em>they know how to look</em>), etc.</p>

<p>If you're on a farm, away from cities, in a place with reasonably low light pollution, and your eyes are good, and you've been sitting in perfect pitch black darkness for at least 30 minutes prior - when you look up you can reasonably expect to see a few thousand objects, mostly stars. Keep looking, and after a while you will distinguish one or two thousand more stars, very faint, that you could not see at first sight. Practice this steadily for a few years, and you'll add maybe another thousand; but you won't be able to see those all at once - only one at a time.</p>

<p>Now travel to the Cerro Tololo site in Chile, up in the mountaineous desert, zero light pollution, excellent transparency, and you'll multiply all those numbers by a factor of 2x ... 5x.</p>

<p>As you can see, the numbers are very flexible because there are so many factors involved. You can't just slap a 44k label on it and call it a day; that doesn't make any sense in reality. Astronomers know that the pure magnitude number doesn't mean much by itself, because it is just one factor among many.</p>

<p>In a place with very high light pollution (like where I live, in the middle of a large, dense, sprawling urban area in California), you'd be lucky if you can see a hundred stars at night.</p>

<p>Or, in a place with zero light pollution, shine a flashlight into someone's face, and you've temporarily blinded them. You've reduced the number of stars they could see by an order of magnitude for the next half hour (night vision gradually recovers, and it takes 30 minutes to fully recover, according to US military manuals and visual astronomers practice).</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, Equator versus poles.</p>

<p>The spin axis of the Earth has a fixed direction in space. The north - south axis always points at the same places in the sky, near Polaris in the north, and near the Southern Cross in the south.</p>

<p>For this reason, at the North Pole, you only ever see half the sky - the northern half, centered on Polaris. At the South Pole, you only see the other half. You'll never see Polaris from Australia.</p>

<p>At the Equator, you pretty much see the whole sky - not all at once, of course, but as the Earth rotates, it gradually exposes all parts of the sky at different times. However, the parts near Polaris and near the Southern Cross are always low in the sky and a bit hard to see.</p>

<p>So, bottom line is this:</p>

<p>In any place on Earth, in any given instant, you see exactly half of the sky. At the poles, that half is all you <em>ever</em> see. At the Equator, if you're patient, you'll eventually see the whole sky in time, as the Earth rotates and gradually exposes different parts of the sky at different times.</p>

<p>The photo was taken by DSCOVR at Lagrange point 1.</p>

<p>In the picture, The Moon appears dark gray. Of course the Earth appears bright, reflecting sunlight from clouds and water. The Moon's surface is gray and should reflect less light than the Earth.</p>

<p>It should be irrelevant that we see the far side, since the reflectivity of the Moon's surface should be the same on the far side as the side that faces the Earth.</p>

<p>The midnight full Moon appears much, much brighter as seen from Earth than it does in this picture, despite the fact that the amount of sunlight reflecting from the surface of the Moon is the same in both instances.</p>

<p>I understand the photo was taken with 3 separate exposures of red, blue and green, but this should not affect the brightness.</p>

<p>So why does it appear so dull?</p>
","<p>That's what it really would look like if you were there with DSCOVR.

"What causes a neutron star to become a pulsar?","2884","","<p>Leading on from <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/42/what-causes-a-star-to-become-a-pulsar/44#44"">this pulsar question</a>, what criteria/processes make neutron stars become pulsars, do all neutron stars become pulsars?</p>
","<p>It is thought that <strong>all neutron stars are pulsars when they are first born</strong>, as all spin extremely rapidly and have strong magnetic fields shortly after birth, arising from their dramatic collapse from a few Earth-sized massive star core into a city-sized neutron star. Conservation of angular momentum means that an initially slow-rotating core becomes a rapidly spinning neutron star, which also drives a dynamo action that generates a strong magnetic field.</p>

<p>The emission from a neutron star comes as a result of pair-production in its magnetosphere, which has an approximately dipolar shape and thus the strongest field strength at its poles. This field is rarely aligned with the spin axis, thus giving the ""lighthouse"" effect where the beam sweeps over an observer at twice the spin frequency. These pair-produced particles radiate energy via synchrotron emission (primarily in the radio), sapping energy from the magnetic field. As the neutron star ages, the magnetic field eventually decays below a critical point where electrons/positrons cannot be pair-produced. This is called the ""<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...402..264C"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">death line</a>,"" illustrated here and denoted by the word ""graveyard"" on a P-P_dot diagram:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UvrDY.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>After crossing this threshold, the pulsar loses its ability to emit radio waves. Pulsars only remain pulsars for the first ~10^7 years of their lives, and thus about 99% of neutron stars are no longer pulsars.</p>

<p>Additionally, we can only see a pulsar if its beam crosses over the Earth while the pulsar rotates. As the beam angle is usually <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...715..230O"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tens of degrees</a>, the total fraction of pulsars whose beams cross the Earth is approximately 10% the total that exist.</p>

<p>In the lower-left of the diagram you can see very short period pulsars, these are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond_pulsar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">millisecond pulsars</a> and have been spun up by accreting mass from a companion. These pulsars have very long lifetimes, but only represent a small subset of the neutron star population.</p>

<p>Headlines sometimes oversimplify. But if this is really true, that there seems to be about ten times more galaxies than had been generally assumed, does this impact other assumptions? Does this imply the universe is ten times more massive, or just that there is less dark matter than was previously thought. </p>
","<p>All <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03909"" rel=""nofollow"">Conselice et al. (2016)</a> appear to suggest is that when you look at something like the Hubble deep field, there are many faint (and presumably low mass) galaxies that are not seen. This has absolutely no effect on the need for dark matter.</p>

<p>The main results are: (i) as you look back in time, the overall (co-moving) density of galaxies (more massive than a million times that of the Sun) increases. (ii) But the density of more massive galaxies actually decreases. This is consistent with hierarchical merger picture where small galaxies merge to become larger galaxies.
This really doesn't have any influence on the need for dark matter.</p>

<p>First, the presence of dark matter is inferred from many different observations. Some of these (e.g. galaxy rotation curves) are not influenced at all if there are lots of extra galaxies.</p>

<p>Second, the ""missing"" galaxies are at high redshift, not (or not all) in the present day universe, so they cannot significantly affect a calculation of how much normal matter there is in the universe <em>today</em>. Presumably, many of these small galaxies then merge to become larger galaxies and the total mass is conserved.</p>

<p>Third, just because there are lots of them does not mean they contain much mass anyway. The ""mass function"" (number density as a function of mass) of galaxies goes roughly as $\phi(M) \propto M^{-1}$ at low masses. This means the mass contained in any interval is
 $$M_{\text{tot}}\propto \int^{M_2}_{M_1} M\phi \ \mathrm{d}M \ = M_2 - M_1$$
So although, low mass galaxies may be ten times more frequent, they are ten times less massive and so don't change the total mass very much. I will need to read the paper more carefully to see if the authors are suggesting that low mass galaxies are much more common in the early universe than was <em>already</em> supposed.</p>

<p>Fourth, primordial nucleosynthesis calculations tell us that only 4 per cent (as a fraction of the critical density) of the energy density of the universe is in the form of baryonic mass. Observations of gravitational lensing, cluster dynamics and the cosmic microwave background tell us that the mass density is actually around 30 per cent of the critical density. Thus most of the dark matter is non-baryonic and cannot be in the form of missing faint galaxies, or any other form of normal baryonic matter. </p>

<p>Another theory is that they are formed when a moon comes closer to a planet than the Roche limit, the tidal forces cause it to break up and form a ring. Though the presence of ""shepherd"" moons in the rings of Saturn does hint that this may not be major source of material.</p>

<p>Both explanations, to me, imply that you'd only get major ring systems around larger (gas giant) planets, though it doesn't preclude rings around smaller (rocky) planets. This seems to be borne out by our solar system where the gas giants have rings whereas the rocky planets don't.</p>

<p>As I understand it, Earth's initial uranium has fallen into the core. The uranium mines dig into concentrated deposits of uranium in the crust which came from uranium rich asteroids.</p>

<p>B) If any kind of asteroid large enough hits a uranium rich part of the Earth crust (making it the second one on the same spot), it could maybe eject much of Earth's own uranium and thus cause a dangerous fallout?</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor"" rel=""nofollow"">Natural nuclear reactors</a>, which would produce short-lived radioactive isotopes, don't occur any more on Earth, since the natural U-235/U-238 isotope ratio is too low, now.

<li>Why does this relationship involves the absolute magnitude of the sun and its luminosity?</li>
<li>How to derive an expression relating the absolute magnitude of a star to its luminosity?</li>
</ul>

<p>So according to the magnitude equation, $$m - M = 2.5\log\left(\frac{d^2}{d_0^2}\right)$$ 
$$\Rightarrow M = m - 2.5\log\left(\frac{d^2}{d_0^2}\right)\ \ (eq1)$$</p>

<p>and Luminosity is $$L = 4\pi(d^2) \times f$$<br>
 $$\Rightarrow d^2 = \frac{L}{4\pi \times f}\ \ (eq2)$$</p>

<p>Plugging eq2 to eq1 would have seem reasonable, but how is absolute magnitude of the sun and its luminosity used?</p>
","<p>Absolute magnitude can refer to either the absolute visual magnitude (which is measured by visible light) or the absolute bolometric magnitude (which is measured by light of all wavelengths). You're thinking of visual absolute magnitude; how bright an object would appear to our eyes if the object were 10 parsecs away from us. However, you must remember that stars emit a wide spectrum of light — much of it isn't visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>Luminosity is a measure of the total amount of energy given off by a star (usually as light) in a certain amount of time. Thus, luminosity includes both visible light and invisible light emitted by a star.</p>

<p>Because luminosity measures all emitted light, while absolute visual magnitude measures visible emitted light, we can't accurately relate them. We <em>can</em>, however, use a different measurement for absolute magnitude: absolute bolometric magnitude. This takes into account the entire spectrum of light emitted by the star, and measures the amount of energy emitted by the star, rather than its intrinsic brightness from a human's perspective. Keep in mind that ABM numbers shouldn't be compared to AVM numbers.</p>

<p>The formula relating absolute bolometric magnitude with luminosity is as follows:
$$L_\text{star} = L_0 10^{-0.4 M_\text{Bol}}$$</p>

<p>where $L_\text{star}$ is the star's luminosity, $M_{\text{Bol}}$ is the bolometric magnitude of the star, and $L_{0}$ is the zero-point luminosity (the luminosity of a star with $M_{\text{Bol}} = 0$).</p>

<p>The zero-point luminosity is $3.0128×10^{28}$ watts. According to the <a href=""http://www.iau.org/news/announcements/detail/ann15023/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IAU</a>, this value was set so that the Sun's luminosity ($3.828 × 10^{26}$ watts) corresponds closely to absolute bolometric magnitude of 4.74, which is an arbitrary value that's commonly used in modern literature.</p>

"Is a perfectly circular orbit possible?","2795","","<p>Let's assume that there is a perfectly spherical planet and there is a moon which is also perfectly spherical. Let's assume that there is no atmospheric drag and no other gravitational pull. If the moon is put in a perfectly circular orbit around the planet somehow, would the moon eventually ""fall"" towards the planet and form an elliptical orbit or would it continue to follow the perfectly circular orbit?</p>

<p>Edit: What i actually wanted to ask is that would the <em>gravity</em> of the planet cause the moon to ""fall"" towards the planet or would the gravity allow the moon to continue its orbit without bending its path any further towards the planet. I know that no planet can be a true sphere or a cube due to the shapes of the particles.</p>
","<p>Short answer:  </p>

<p>Yes.  If you ignore the tidal effect and relativity and any change in mass (planets radiate light and lose atmosphere and add space dust and meteors all the time, so mass isn't constant), then in a two body system with no outside effects, the orbit would remain perfectly circular.   There would be no outside force to affect the circular orbit.    A circular orbit is impossible because nothing can be that exact, but on a computer simulation you could set it up and it would remain circular.</p>

<p>Long answer:</p>

<p>For your scenario to work you'd need to give both the planet and moon infinite hardness, so they wouldn't bend at all and fixed mass and space would need to be completely empty of anything else.  Needless to say that's impossible.  But only in Newtonian gravity.  </p>

<p>Relativity creates a very very tiny decay in orbits, in your system of a planet/moon that would be close to negligible but there would be a very tiny spiraling inward.    The relativistic effect on an orbit was first noticed with Mercury's orbit around the sun (and Mercury isn't falling into the sun, it was noticed by other effects - but lets not get into that here).   </p>

<p>Similarly, any loss in mass, gain in mass or orbital drag (because space is full of tiny particles, fast moving particles, photons and neutrinos, all of which cause a tiny but at least in simulation, calculatable drag), then the two body system would have an imperceptibly small spiral and not be a perfect circle.  You could say in a sense that it becomes elliptical but it would be more like a constant very tiny force where, once it was elliptical, it could wonder back to more circular.   Not all perturbations or drag on an orbit make that orbit more elliptical, it can work in either direction.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that ""falling"" or decaying towards the planet wouldn't ""create"" an elliptical orbit.   A circle is an ellipse.   You asked specifically about 2 body systems, where, ignoring tides, falling in or out would be more of a slow spiral.   An ellipse isn't the result of a decaying or perturbed orbit.  An ellipse is the baseline orbit.  Perturbations and orbital decay happen on top of the ellipse (if that makes sense), they don't cause the ellipse. </p>

<p>In a 3 or more body system you get orbital perturbations on the orbits.   Those often remain stable, they're just variations that mostly move back and forth.

","<p>The rest frame for measuring (astronomical) speeds and velocities depends on the context and purpose.</p>

<p>A geocentric frame, based on the Earth's centre of mass might be appropriate for objects in orbit around the Earth.</p>

<p>A heliocentric reference frame, centred on the Sun, is often used when describing the line of sight velocities of astronomical objects, but more usually, a barycentric frame at the solar system centre of mass is used. For example, this is how the radial velocities measurements of exoplanet host stars or components of eclipsing binaries would be quoted. It would also be appropriate for the motion of objects in the solar system.</p>

<p>Motions in the Galaxy are commonly defined in two ways. One is the Local Standard of Rest (LSR), which measures velocities with respect to the average motion of stars near the Sun. The second attempts to measure velocities with respect to the Galactic plane and radially and tangentially in the plane with respect to the Galactic centre. These are the so-called $U,V,W$ velocities. The position and motion of the LSR with respect to the Galactic centre are uncertain at the level of a few km/s, whereas the solar motion with respect to the LSR is more precisely known.</p>

<p>The Galactic centre can also be used as a reference frame for the motion of galaxies in our local group. e.g. when talking about the motion of the Andromeda Galaxy.</p>

<p>Finally, we can determine a cosmic standard of rest - the co-moving stationary frame of the Hubble flow - using precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

"Do galaxies change shape and size over time?","2718","","<p>Galaxies come in different shapes and sizes. What factors determine the shape and size of a galaxy, and how can these change over time?</p>
","<p>The size of a galaxy is dependent on how the matter was distributed in the early universe, and how it collapsed under its own gravity to form clumps of (dark) matter that the galaxies would form around. </p>

<p>The very earliest galaxies are irregular, but as matter fell towards them, and they developed a consistent orbital direction they formed into a disc. Gravity waves in the disc then show up as spiral arms. Large galaxies that are actively forming stars tend to have this structure. Small galaxies may never reach the point of forming a disc and remain irregular.</p>

<p>As galaxies collide and interact, the orbits of the stars are disrupted. The result of the merger of two large spiral galaxies is often a galaxy in which the stars orbit in all directions, which looks like an elliptical galaxy. Star formation in elliptical galaxies is often very low. Elliptical galaxies are the most evolved form of galaxies. </p>

<p>The time scale of this evolution is slow. It takes billions of years for galaxies to evolve from one form to another.</p>

<p>The details of the process of galaxy formation and evolution are still uncertain. The exact nature of dark matter will be important in understanding how galaxies form. The role (if any) that black holes play in galaxy formation is uncertain.</p>

"Does the radio signal decay when it travels through the intergalactic space?","2707","","<p>When you emit the radio signal it starts moving at the speed of light. Radio beam is diffusing with each kilometer the signal has traveled. To the nearby receiver the signal is strong. But if the receiver is far away, the signal will become weaker and weaker until it becomes a noise. So the question is does the same happen in deep space and what distance radio signal (or any electromagnetic wave frequency) could travel until it becomes noise?</p>
","<p>The first thing to consider is that the area of a beam will, over long distances, diffuse. The best situation we can hope for is a diffraction-limited system, where this diffusion is minimized thus maximizing our received signal. That is, in theory we have a perfectly collimated transmission beam that neither diverges nor converges.</p>

<p>In practice, we are still limited by diffraction. A diffraction limited system is described by the formula</p>

<p>$$ \sin\theta = \frac{1.22\lambda}{D}, $$</p>

<p>which prescribes an angular resolution $\theta$ in terms of wavelength $\lambda$ and a circular aperture of diameter $D$. This is called the <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/raylei.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rayleigh criterion</a>. The definition of angular resolution, in this case, is when two point sources are just discernable from each other where the principal maximum of the airy disk pattern of one source coincides with the first minimum of another. It's this definition that results in the apparently arbitrary constant of $1.22$.</p>

<p>We usually think of diffraction being applicable in terms of receiving a signal - for example, a space telescope will usually have a diffraction-limited optical system. However, the exact same laws hold true whether we are receiving or sending a signal. The optical path is the same. Everything is just in reverse!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Side note: if we instead <a href=""http://i380.photobucket.com/albums/oo247/Vuldacon/BatmanSignalLightWonder.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">projected an image into space</a>, in order to acceptably resolve the image a receiver would need to have an angular resolution equal to, or greater than, than the projection. This includes a spatial resolution criterion in addition to the signal-to-noise performance discussed below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To make a real-life example, let's consider a radio signal. Since a distant receiver will be getting a frequency-modulated signal not unlike FM radio, we are not concerned with angular resolution. We don't care if the ""image"" is blurred, or even if some areas of the originally transmitted beam entirely miss our receiver. All we are concerned with is the modulation of frequency over time - it's a one-dimesional signal.</p>

<p>In this case, a receiver is a noise-limited system. <a href=""http://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report2/42-45/45R.PDF"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This NASA report</a> outlines some of the limitations that a realistic implementation of interstellar communication must deal with. Even in the case of a quantum noise-limited system, we can still <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/squeezed-light-mutes-quantum-noise-1.13510"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">make the best</a> of the limitations dealt to us.</p>

<p>If the signal-to-noise ratio is above an acceptable threshold then the signal will be received well. There are so many factors to consider that really only an order-of-magnitude estimate is feasible. I don't know enough about this to come up with a good estimate myself of the noise levels of a particular system.</p>

<p><a href=""http://seti.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/19730010095_1973010095.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Project Cyclops</a> (1971) was the initial investigation into the feasibility of a search for extraterrestrial intelligence. For example, on page 41, we can see that the minimum <a href=""http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Papers/rcvr_basics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">noise temperature</a> of a receiver receiving the 2.4 GHz <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Arecibo message</a> is about 4K - the major contributor to noise here is the CMB. Frequencies of this order of magnitude will usually provide the best possible noise performance - too high and quantum noise and atmospheric effects become significant. Too low, and galactic noise takes over.</p>

<p>This noise temperature provides a noise floor for the signal. The receiver usually introduces a significant noise temperature to the degree of some tens or hundreds of Kelvin, so any practical limitations on interstellar communication tend to become a function of our equipment.</p>

<p>Although the Arecibo message was broadcast at a good frequency, for very long-distance communication amplitude modulation is superior to frequency modulation as it's easy to increase the pulse duration and interval to compensate for a weaker signal strength.</p>

<p>This table from page 50 of the well-worth-reading Cyclops report shows that a single $100~ \mathrm{m}$ transmitter/receiver combination, with a transmission power of $10^5~\mathrm{W}$, could function at a distance of 500 light years.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VWc5B.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Building bigger transmitters and receivers will increase the maximum distance of communications. So will increasing the transmission power, pulse duration, and pulse interval. Current technology could let us communicate over tens or hundreds of light years. To communicate further, just <em>build something bigger</em>. The laws of physics place few limits on the distance we can communicate.</p>

","<p>There's several ways this question could be answered, but they all come down to an emphatic ""no"" - a black hole will not return to being a main sequence star.

"Calculate angle of inclination for a certain angle in a planet's orbit?","2648","","<p>The background is that I'm trying to write a computer program to show at what angles each planet would be able to be seen transiting in front of the sun from an observer outside our solar system.  My endgame is to calculate the relative percentages of the sky that could see any group of planets transiting together.  For instance in the direction the Earth is from the sun in June and December, an alien observer that could see Earth transit could also see Venus transit, but from the angle where the Earth is in September or March they would not ever be able to see Venus transit.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href=""http://ideone.com/neujND"">a program</a> using basic stats and circular orbits to test out the idea, but I would like to make it more robust using actual elliptical orbits and I'm having trouble.  For circular orbits with the sun at the center I was able to just take the inclination of Earth's orbit times the <code>sin</code> of the viewing longitude relative to the longitude of ascention.</p>

<pre><code>double viewingLongitude = longitudeRadians - LongitudeOfAscent;
double planetAngle = Inclination * Math.Sin(viewingLongitude);
</code></pre>

<p>For instance Earth's orbit has an inclination of 1.57 degrees and longitude of ascent at 348.74 degrees.  At 348.74 degrees and 168.74 degrees Earth will have an actual inclination of 0 degrees.  At 78.74 degrees and 158.74 degrees Earth will have an actual inclination of 1.57 and -1.57 degrees from the plane.</p>

<p>Is there a similar easy way I could calculate that inclination for the elliptical orbit of the Earth or will I have to solve Kepler's equations?</p>
","<p>In short, no, you don't have to solve Kepler's equation. If you define a viewing longitude and you know the full set of Keplerian orbital elements, you can calculate if a planet will show a transit.</p>

<p>Let me first clear up some of the jargon, though. The term inclination is traditionally reserved for the angle between the orbital plane and the reference plane. So unless the entire orbit is wobbling (for instance due to precession) the inclination will be constant for all positions of the planet.</p>

<p>The angle that varies as the planet moves through the reference plane is the latitude. However, in this particular problem calculating the latitude isn't particularly useful. The more practical coordinate to look at is the height of the planet away from the plane, I'll call this $r_z$. If along your observers line of sight you find $r_z$ to be smaller than the solar radius, the planet will show a transit.</p>

<p>Working out a fully general elliptical orbit in 3 dimensions is somewhat tricky, so I'll start out with a simple Cartesian coordinate system aligned with the orbital plane. In subsequent steps I work my way back using a number of coordinate transformations.</p>

<p>First a list of the Kepler parameters and their meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li>$\nu$ - true anomaly - The anglular position with respect to perigee in the orbital plane.</li>
<li>$\omega$ - argument of periapsis - The angular position of perigee with respect to the ascending node in the orbital plane.</li>
<li>$\lambda_{asc}$ - the longitude of ascending node in the invariable plane ($\Omega$ in the picture).</li>
<li>$i$ - inclination - the angle between the orbital plane and the invariable plane, such that $\lambda_{asc}$ gives the rotation axis. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/t8Zsq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now, in the orbital plane, the radius of the planet orbit is given as
$$
r(\nu) = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos(\nu)}
$$
If I define the x-axis to align with the ascending node, I can write the position vector as
$$
\vec{r}_{orb} = r(\nu) 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\cos(\omega+\nu) \\ 
\sin(\omega+\nu) \\ 
0 
\end{bmatrix}
$$</p>

<p>To move to a Cartesian coordinate system aligned with the invariable plane I have to apply a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Basic_rotations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rotation</a> of angle $i$ about the x-axis, so
$$
\vec{r} = R_x(i)\vec{r}_{orb}= r(\nu)
\begin{bmatrix} 
\cos(\omega+\nu) \\ 
\sin(\omega+\nu)\cos(i) \\ 
\sin(\omega+\nu)\sin(i)
\end{bmatrix}
$$
So now I have an expression for $r_z$, I just need to know how $\nu$ relates to the planet longitude in the invariable plane, $\lambda_{planet}$.</p>

<p>I can find the longitude of the planet relative to $\lambda_{asc}$ as
$$
\lambda'_{planet} = \arctan( \frac{r_y}{r_x} ) 
$$ 
such that the actual longitude is
$$
\lambda_{planet} = \lambda_{asc} + \lambda'_{planet}
$$
Inverting this last expression gives
$$
\nu(\lambda) = \arctan( \frac{\tan(\lambda - \lambda_{asc})}{\cos(i)} ) - \omega
$$</p>

<p>Now I have all the equations to answer the question:
If the planet is along the observer's line of sight, then is has a true anomaly 
of $\nu(\lambda_{obs})$, which gives a height above the plane
$$
r_z(\nu) = r(\nu)\sin(\omega+\nu)\sin(i)
$$
If $|r_{z}| &lt; R_{sun}$ the planet can be seen in transit.</p>

"Can a tectonically inactive planet retain a long-term atmosphere?","2620","","<p>Can a planet be tectonically inactive and still retain a magnetosphere and protected atmosphere? How does that work?</p>

<p>How else could a planet retain a thick atmosphere like Earth's for extensive periods of time? </p>

<p>Note, I'm not asking on Earth science SE as, well, the question is not about Earth. I was hoping there was some sort of astronomical theory for <em>other</em> potential habitable planets.</p>
","<h3>Yes, a tectonically inactive planet can retain a long-term atmosphere.</h3>

<p>You make the connection that a lack of plate tectonics on a planet indicates a ""dead"" core and thus said planet has no magnetosphere. As such, I'm going to interpret your question as, can a planet without a magnetosphere retain an atmosphere long-term? As proof, I offer up Venus.</p>

<p><strong>Venus' Magnetic Field</strong></p>

<p>Venus is a planet without a magnetosphere generated by a core. It is thought that the cause for this is Venus' slow rotation rate (of nearly 243 days) and a lack of convection, allowing for bulk motion in the core. As I'm sure you know, you need moving charge to make magnetic fields and Venus' core just isn't moving. As such, we see that Venus is a tectonically dead planet - it's surface is roughly 500 million years old, whereas Earth's surface gets recycled every 100 million years or less due to our plate tectonics.</p>

<p>Now, Venus is not entirely devoid of a magnetic field. Ironically enough, it's lack of a magnetosphere allows for the generation of a magnetic field by it's atmosphere. Because the Sun's radiation is more or less directly hitting the atmosphere, Venus has a strong ionosphere. When you get lots of charged particles moving around in an atmosphere, you get a magnetic field. But on the whole, this field is very, very weak compared to a true magnetosphere such as we have on Earth.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~nimmo/website/paper25.pdf"">this source</a> which talks a lot about this concept and why Venus doesn't have a magnetosphere. Check it out to get a lot more in depth detail.</p>

<p><strong>Venus' Atmosphere</strong></p>

<p>So, Venus has no appreciable magnetosphere (or plate tectonics). Why does it have an atmosphere? And boy does it have an atmosphere. The surface pressure on Venus is estimated to be $\sim93\:\mathrm{atm}$.</p>

<p>In short, the answer is that the inundation of solar wind against an atmosphere is not necessarily the major contributing factor to atmospheric loss. It can be, but not always. For example, Mercury, another planet with a weak (but non-zero) magnetosphere, has no atmosphere (if it ever did) because it is so close to the Sun that the solar wind likely blew away that atmosphere long ago. Venus on the other hand is far enough away that the solar wind just can't strip the atmosphere. Here I'm going to quote <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Significance_of_solar_winds"">wikipedia</a> directly (emphasis mine).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lack of magnetic field does not determine the fate of a planet's atmosphere. Venus, for instance, has no powerful magnetic field. Its close proximity to the Sun also increases the speed and number of particles, and would presumably cause the atmosphere to be stripped almost entirely, much like that of Mars. Despite this, the atmosphere of Venus is two orders of magnitudes denser than Earth's. Recent models indicate that stripping by <strong>solar wind accounts for less than 1/3 of total non-thermal loss processes.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Atmospheric Loss</strong></p>

<p>If the solar wind isn't the contributing factor in atmospheric loss, what is? The answer to that is a process known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Thermal_escape_mechanisms"">Jean's Escape</a>. To put it simply, for gas particles in the atmosphere to escape into space, they need enough energy to climb out of the planet's gravity well. Some particles will have that energy and thus escape into space. Over time, the atmosphere bleeds off, little by little (this is happening for Earth too!).</p>

<p>The factors that contribute to the rate at which a planet loses its atmosphere are such things as the the planet's mass and radius, and the mass of the atmospheric particles. Let's look at Venus. It is comparable in mass and size to Earth and so has a reasonably appreciable gravity well. For something to escape Venus it must be traveling at $10.4\:\mathrm{km/s}$ (compared to the Earth's $11.2\:\mathrm{km/s}$). But, for Venus at least, the important factor there is that the atoms and molecules in its atmosphere are heavy. It is almost entirely ($\sim97\%$) carbon dioxide which has a mass of $\sim44\:\mathrm{amu}$. That means, the chances of such a massive particle getting the energy to escape is pretty small.</p>

<p><strong>Out-gassing</strong></p>

<p>Just one more point to add to this. One may argue that possibly the atmosphere is/can be replenished continuously, but that won't work here because we're assuming the planet is tectonically dead. You can't really have out-gassing on a planet with no active surface.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>There are many factors that determine atmospheric escape. Different planets will lose their atmospherics for different reasons. However, it is entirely possible for a planet, under the right conditions, to maintain an atmosphere long-term, despite lacking a global magnetosphere. As we can see from Venus, the conditions are generally that the planet should be sufficiently far from the star, its atmosphere should be sufficiently dense and comprised of heavy particles, and the planet itself should be large enough to have an appreciable gravity well. If these conditions are all met, a planet may retain an atmosphere without having a magnetosphere to protect it.</p>

<p>Conventionally, the moon's appearance is divided into four phases: first quarter, full, last quarter, new. That means that on average, each phase lasts about $7.4$ days. Since calendars count days in integer amounts, a $7$-day period seems to be a natural choice.</p>

<p>The social importance of the seven-day period in Western cultural probably has much more to do with its religious significance in Abrahamic religions than astronomy per se (although certainly not unique to it).

"Is it possible that some stars are already black holes yet we see light emitted from before becoming a black hole?","2606","","<p>For stars we see that are burning fuel at a fast rate, that are very bright, (or any star for that matter sufficiently far away from us) could it be that they are already black holes (the sufficiently large ones) and we are just seeing the light emitted during it's main phase? So, if so, is it safe to say that most of the stars are already dead that we see?</p>

<p>Edit: I appreciate all the answers. This has been a fascinating read. I also hate having to select a ""the answer"" when I gleaned something from all of them.</p>
","<p>It depends what you mean by ""see"".  I assume that you mean with the naked eye.  Let's do some rough calculations to estimate the odds.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/how-far-away-is-the-farthest-star.html"">The farthest single star visible to the naked eye is Deneb</a>, estimated distance around 1550 light years. Most stars visible to the naked eye are much closer.  Since even the sort of star that forms a black hole lives a few million years, we would expect perhaps as many as one sufficiently large star in a thousand to have formed a black hole during the time their light was on the way to us.</p>

<p>There are <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/how-many-stars-are-there-in-the-sky/281641/"">about 5000 stars visible to the naked eye</a> under good conditions, but only <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_massive_known_stars"">a hundred or so</a> massive enough to form black holes.  So on that basis, the odds are that there is at most one such star, and probably none.</p>

<p>To estimate this another way, consider that there is <a href=""http://www.uni.edu/morgans/astro/course/Notes/section2/new9.html"">on average one supernova in a galaxy per century</a>.  Comparing the distance to the farthest visible star with the diameter of the galaxy I estimate we can see at most 1/2500th of the Milky Way, so we should expect only one visible star to go supernova every 250,000 years.  Dividing that by the distance in light years to the farthest visible stars, we get only about one chance in a hundred that any of the visible stars have gone supernova during the time their light was on the way to us.</p>

<p>One caveat is that I've gotten these figures from disparate sources, based on Google searches.  However, it seems clear that the odds are not good.  Hopefully one of the experts can provide better data.</p>

<p>Brightness drops as $\dfrac{1}{r^2}$ with distance from the light source. Earth is at $1~\textrm{AU}.$ The theoretical planet is at $200~\textrm{AU}$ when it's closest to the sun, and up to $2800~\textrm{AU}$ at the point furthest from the sun at the upper end of the estimated orbit.</p>

<p><br>So e.g. $1/200^2 = 1/40,000$ of the brightness (luminance) as seen from Earth.</p>

<li><p>$2800~\textrm{AU},$ upper bound on aphelion (the point on orbit most distant from the sun): $-8~\textrm{EV}.$ This would be dark, but you would probably still see enough to avoid running into things.</p></li>

"Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole?","2578","","<p>My understanding is that time slows and approaches stopping when approaching the event horizon of a black hole.

<blockquote>
  <p>Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called ""frozen stars"",[17] because an outside observer  would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean then that no matter actually falls into a black hole (except possibly what was there at its formation)?  Would this also mean matter is accumulating just outside its event horizon?  As I understand it, this would be the perspective from outside the black hole.  If this is the case, I wonder if we would observe a tremendous amount of matter surrounding the event horizon, but it would be extremely red shifted?</p>

","<p>Yes, you are absolutely right, from OUR VIEWPOINT it does.</p>

<p>From Kip Thorne's book ""Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy.""</p>

<p>“Like a rock dropped from a rooftop, the star’s surface falls downward (shrinks inward) slowly at first, then more and more rapidly. Had Newton’s laws of gravity been correct, this acceleration of the implosion would continue inexorably until the star, lacking any internal pressure, is crushed to a point at high speed. Not so according to Oppenheimer and Snyder’s relativistic formulas. Instead, as the star nears its critical circumference, its shrinkage slows to a crawl. The smaller the star gets, the more slowly it implodes, until it becomes frozen precisely at the critical circumference. No matter how long a time one waits, if one is at rest outside the star (that is, at rest in the static external reference frame) one will never be able to see the star implode through the critical circumference. That is the unequivocal message of Oppenheimer and Snyder’s formulas.”</p>

<p>“Is this freezing of the implosion caused by some unexpected, general relativistic force inside the star? No, not at all, Oppenheimer and Snyder realized. Rather, it is caused by gravitational time dilation (the slowing of the flow of time) near the critical circumference. Time on the imploding star’s surface, as seen by static external observers, must flow more and more slowly, when the star approaches the critical circumference, and correspondingly everything occurring on or inside the star including its implosion must appear to go into slow motion and then gradually freeze.”</p>

<p>“As peculiar as this might seem, even more peculiar was another prediction made by Oppenheimer and Snyder’s formulas: Although, as seen by static external observers, the implosion freezes at the critical circumference, it does not freeze at all as viewed by observers riding inward on the star’s surface. If the star weighs a few solar masses and begins about the size of the sun, then as observed from its own surface, it implodes to the critical circumference in about an hour’s time, and then keeps right on imploding past criticality and on in to smaller circumferences.”</p>

<p>“By looking at Oppenheimer and Snyder’s formulas from the viewpoint of an observer on the star’s surface, one can deduce the details of the implosion, even after the star sinks within its critical circumference; that is one can discover that the star gets crunched to infinite density and zero volume, and one can deduce the details of the spacetime curvature at the crunch.” P217-218</p>

<p>OK, so from our perspective all the matter will be clustered around the critical circumference and no further. That's fine, this shell in theory can exert all the forces required on the external universe such as gravitational attraction, magnetic field etc. The point like singularity which is in the indefinite future of the black hole, (from our point of view) indeed in the indefinite future of the universe itself could not exert such forces on this universe. This singularity is only ""reached"" as an observer rides in past the critical circumference and, through the process of time dilation, reaches the end of the universe.</p>

<p>This is obviously an area of active research and thinking.  Some of the greatest minds on the planet are approaching this issue in different ways but so far have not reached a consensus but intriguingly a consensus appears to be beginning to emerge.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sciencealert.com/stephen-hawking-explains-how-our-existence-can-escape-a-black-hole"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.sciencealert.com/stephen-hawking-explains-how-our-existence-can-escape-a-black-hole</a></p>

<p>Stephen  Hawking said at a conference in August 2015 that he believes that ""information is stored not in the interior of the black hole as one might expect, but on its boundary, the event horizon."" His comment refers to the resolution of the ""information paradox,"" a long-running physics debate in which Hawking eventually concedes that the material that falls into a black hole isn't destroyed, but rather becomes part of the black hole.</p>

<p>Read more at: <a href=""http://phys.org/news/2015-06-surface-black-hole-firewalland-nature.html#jCp"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://phys.org/news/2015-06-surface-black-hole-firewalland-nature.html#jCp</a></p>

<p>In the mid-90s, American and Dutch physicists Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft also addressed the information paradox by proposing that when something gets sucked into a black hole, its information leaves behind a kind of two-dimensional holographic imprint on the event horizon, which is a sort of ‘bubble’ that contains a black hole through which everything must pass.</p>

<p>What occurs at the event horizon of a black hole is very hard to understand. What is clear, and what proceeds from General Relativity, is that from the viewpoint of an external observer in this universe, any infalling matter cannot proceed past the critical circumference.  Most scientists then change the viewpoint to explain how, from the viewpoint of an infalling observer, they will proceed in a very short period of time to meet the singularity at the centre of the black hole. 
This has given rise to the notion that there is a singularity at the centre of every black hole.</p>

<p>However this is is an illusion, as the time it will take to reach the singularity is essentially infinite to us in the external universe. </p>

<p>The fact that the matter cannot proceed past the critical circumference is perhaps not an “illusion” but very real. The matter must from OUR VIEWPOINT become a “shell” surrounding the critical circumference. It will never fall through the circumference while we remain in this universe. So to talk of a singularity inside a black hole is incorrect.  It has not happened yet. </p>

<p>The path through the event horizon does lead to a singularity in each case, but it is indefinitely far in the future in all cases. If we are in this universe, no singularity has yet been formed. If it has not been formed yet, where is the mass?  The mass is exerting pull on this universe, correct?  Then it must be IN this universe.  From our point of view it must be just this side of the event horizon.</p>

<p>ASTONISHINGLY IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO PROVE THIS.  The recent announcement of gravitational waves detected on the merger of 2 black holes was accompanied by an unverified but potentially matching gamma ray burst from the same area of the sky. This is inexplicable from the conventional viewpoint which holds that all the matter would be compressed into a singularity and would be incapable of coming out again.  </p>

<p>If 2 black holes merge and emit gamma rays… the above is certainly an explanation which is also consistent with General Relativity. The mass never quite made it through the event horizon (from our viewpoint) and was perturbed by the huge violence of the merger, some escaping. It may be a deep gravitational well, but a very powerful gamma ray should just be able to escape given the right kick (attraction by an even larger black hole approaching).</p>

<p>Further more refined observations of similar events, which are likely to be reasonably frequent, may provide more evidence.  There is not likely to be any other credible explanation.</p>

<p>My question is, why does it appear for almost the whole month of December, and then not appear for a few days? Is it based on my location? I live in Alberta, Canada if that helps. </p>
","<p>Two basic conditions need to be met for anyone on the globe to observe the International Space Station (ISS) from any location:</p>

<ul>
<li>ISS needs to pass roughly overhead of your location, and</li>
<li>it needs to do that during night so it's visible to the naked eye</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, obviously there are other requirements, like e.g. weather (if it's overcast we won't be able to see it through the clouds), but those screens you attach don't account for that, since it would be nigh impossible to predict weather so far in advance.</p>

<p>Let's discuss the two basic conditions mentioned a bit more. ISS has an orbital inclination of 51.65°. Why is that is explained in <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/a/2536/49"">this answer on Space.SE</a>, but to quickly recap, this orbital inclination was chosen because it's near ideal for launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where most launches towards the ISS are made from, it is still achievable from the US launch facilities and most US built launchers, and it allows the ISS to go over majority of the populated areas on Earth. So it was decided both for economic reasons, as well as to allow ISS to do as much science as possible.</p>

<p>But what this inclination means is that the ISS will make a ground track (path along the surface of the Earth directly below it) that moves towards the West with each new orbit, even though the ISS itself moves West to East (or saying it otherwise, it's in a prograde Low-Earth orbit). Its ground track could look something like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkXR0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ground track of the International Space Station with an area where it is observable from the Earth's surface<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shown in the white circle (Image source: <a href=""http://www.isstracker.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISS Tracker</a>)</sup></p>

<p>ISS orbital period, the time it takes it to circumnavigate the globe and complete one orbit, is roughly 93 minutes. As you can see in the screen grab from the <a href=""http://www.isstracker.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISS Tracker</a> above, its ground track moves westward on each new orbit, which is due to Earth's rotation on its axis, so this shift towards the West will be equal to how much the Earth rotates in the meantime, which in those 93 minutes comes out at roughly 22,5° or a good 2,505 km (1,556 mi) of the Earth's total equatorial circumference.</p>

<p>But ISS's orbit isn't Sun-synchronous, meaning it won't be over any given Earth latitude at the same local mean solar time, so when it will be observable depends also on its orbital position relative to the position of the Sun. We require that it is dark, remember? ISS isn't bright enough (doesn't reflect enough light with its truss and solar panels) during the day to be brighter than the day skies are. So we have another parameter, which is local time. As you probably anticipated by now, the length of the day isn't really equal at any day of the year, and moving further away from the equator only increases this difference of the length of the day in winter, or the length of it during summer. This is another range or values that your software you're attaching print screens from has to account for.</p>

<p>So, when your software collects data from you regarding your geolocation and current date and time (might do that automatically if you're using it on a device that has GPS enabled), it will establish the times (timetable) of when the ISS ground track is over or around your area, and if that happens during night. The ISS doesn't have to be exactly overhead, at zenith, so it will also calculate angle to the zenith for any area that the ISS goes over, at which you would still be able to see it.</p>

<p>Understanding this, even if we don't look at your timetable, we could establish that if you're at latitude to the equator that enables you to see the ISS, you'd be able to do that roughly a few times in a row separated by around 93 minutes, then wait for the ISS ground track to come back towards your longitude (16 orbits or about one day and an hour), and do that during night when you'd be able to observe it. Nights are long now during December at Northern latitudes, so you see a long row of couples of such chances during each night. As long as the weather holds, of course.</p>

<p>How much sense does it make to talk about the age of the universe as a whole?</p>

<p>We can observe <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation"">time dilation</a> so we know time passes differently for observers moving at different speeds (special relativistic time dilation) or located at different distances from centres of strong gravitational fields (as explained by general relativity). Is the estimated age of the universe a property of the universe or of us as its observers? </p>

<p>Would a different observer perceive the age of the universe to be different? Do different parts of the universe have different ages? Do the principles of special relativity even apply when thinking on a universal scale?</p>
","<p>The answer is yes time dilation does affect how much time an observer experiences since the big bang until the present (cosmological) time.</p>

<p>However there is a certain set of special observers called comoving observers, these are the observers to which the Universe appears isotropic to. For example we can tell the Earth is moving at about 350 km/s relative to a nearby comoving observer by measuring the anistropy in the cosmic microwave background (in fact it causes a relatively large anistropy, the pictures of the CMB you see from WMAP, etc are with this anistropy factored out).</p>

<p>One special property of a comoving observer in the Universe is that they maximize the age of the Universe, i.e. no other observer can experience more time since the big bang than a comoving observer (in case you ask there is no observer that minimizes the time since the big bang).

<p>Nice question.</p>

  <p>Black Holes are regions of space where things get weird.</p>

<p>I'm 100% OK with this statement.  I think it's a true enough summary and I'm sure I've heard physicists say this too.   Even if ""Weird"" isn't a clearly defined scientific term, I'm 100% fine with this (even without a citation).</p>

<p>Are you quoting somebody here?   Anyway, this isn't quite true.   Black holes don't accelerate things from -c (which I'm guessing would be a light beam trying to fly away from the singularity but inside the event horizon), to 0 ""instantaneously"".</p>

<p>Perhaps a better way to look at it is to consider curvature of space, and inside a black hole, space curves so much that all directions point to the singularity.   It's the ""all roads go to Rome"" scenario, even if you do a complete 180, you're still on a road that leads to the singularity.  </p>

<p>I understand the temptation to look at that as deceleration, but I think that's a bad way to think about it.  Light doesn't decelerate, it follows the curvature of space.  </p>

<p>outside of a black hole, continuous acceleration would never lead to a speed greater than C.  You can accelerate for billions and trillions of years and all you'd do is just add more 9s to the right of the decimal point.</p>

<p>You seem to be assuming that inside a black hole this can happen, but I'm not sure why you'd assume that.</p>

<p>""continuous gravitational acceleration"" - no matter how strong, is no guarantee for faster than light travel.   That's logically inconsistent with the laws of relativity.  </p>

<p>I think, a more correct way to look at hawking radiation is to see it as something that forms just outside of the black hole, a particle/anti particle pair and one escapes and the other falls inside, and that's probably not 100% correct either, but the singularity itself doesn't send out particles.   Hawking radiation has to do with quantum properties of space.  It's not a property of black holes.  The black hole just happens to be unique in that it can capture one half of a virtual particle pair and the other half can escape.   </p>

<p>This also is a pretty different topic than your original question.  </p>

<p>I think it's a good idea to differentiate mass-less pure energy particles and particles with mass.   You seem to be saying that a ray of light can be traveling away from a black hole at the speed of light, get caught in the gravity, slow down and then fall back into the black hole like a ball that's tossed straight up into the air from the surface of the Earth.   That's probably not what happens.   The ray of light follows the path of space time ahead of it, which happens to be curved so much that it points into the black hole, even if, in the classical sense, the light begins by pointing away.   All space curves into the singularity once you're inside the event horizon, so there is no ""away from"" anymore.   At least, that's how I think it works.</p>

"Circular orbits","2510","","<p>First of all, I'm studying orbits for a hobby: world building. Unfortunately, my mathematical abilities approach a ridiculous low threshold, which means I am stuck with reading the simplest explanations, which in turn leave me asking tons of fairly basic questions.</p>

<p>Allow me to start with a simple point. I know that Kepler's Laws state that planetary orbits must always be elliptical. I also know that Earth's orbit varies from more elliptical to less elliptical, and that its less elliptical stage is nearly circular. </p>

<p>So... what would happen if Earth did have a circular orbit? Why is it impossible for any planet (or moon, by the way) to orbit another body in a perfectly circular path?</p>
","<p>You've been given an answer, and it's perfectly valid, but here's something from a different perspective (less strict).</p>

<p>A circle is really just a particular case of an ellipse. Take an ellipse, and change it, by moving its focal points closer together. When those two points coincide, what you get is a circle. It's still an ellipse, technically - one that happens to have both focal points in the same place, is all.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0T43P.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So yes, you can actually have planetary orbits, or any orbits, circular. There's nothing forbidding that. It's just pretty unlikely that this will occur via a natural process.</p>

<p>As indicated elsewhere, in the real world, all orbits and trajectories are a bit imperfect due to perturbations - whether they be elliptical, circular, parabolic or hyperbolic, they are always a bit perturbed by external factors. In many cases, perturbations are so tiny that you can ignore them.</p>

<p>When a planet is orbiting the Sun, and the orbit is elliptical, the Sun will be in one of those two focal points; the other point has no particular signification. If you could circularize that orbit, then the Sun would be in the center of the circle, of course.</p>

<p>Kepler's laws remain valid for a circular orbit:</p>

<ol>
<li>The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.</li>
</ol>

<p>Still true. A circle is an ellipse where the foci coincide.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Still true. On a circular orbit, the planet moves at constant speed, so the swept area remains constant per time.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.</li>
</ol>

<p>Still true. The semi-major axis becomes the radius of the circle.</p>

<hr>

<p>You must understand that Kepler's laws now have more of a historic interest. They are not exactly at the bleeding edge of science anymore. During Kepler's time, it seemed reasonable to state that all orbits must be elliptical (in the strict sense of the term), but now we know that trajectories (including orbits, or closed trajectories) can be circular, elliptical, parabolic or hyperbolic, depending on a few factors.</p>

<p>We also know that perturbations actually deflect all these trajectories a little bit from ideal shapes (but it's usually a very tiny effect).</p>

<p>We also know that relativity makes all ""elliptical"" orbits more complex - they remain close to elliptic, but the whole ellipse keeps turning around the central star very slowly.</p>

<p>All this stuff was not known during Kepler's time, so take his laws for what they are - a snapshot of the development of our understanding in time.</p>

"Why are stars so far apart?","2501","","<p>So, this is mere musing, but it seems that stars are quite extremely far apart. I tried to determine the mean distance between nearest neighbors for stars (in just our galaxy) but I'm not sure what it is, though a <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=list+of+closest+stars"" rel=""nofollow"">first approximations</a> I would guess that the mean is around 5 ly with some 0.5 standard deviation or so!</p>

<p>However, assuming I didn't screw up, the distance between two sun-massed objects required to generate 1,000N of force between them is an <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt%28%28G+*+%28mass+of+sun%29%5E2%29%2F%281000+newton%29%29"" rel=""nofollow"">incredible 54.3 million ly</a>. [Edit] If you change that to 1 billion Newtons, the distance is one galactic radius -- 54000~ ly!</p>

<p>I'm probably mis-estimating how much even 1kN of force would effect solar trajectories over time, but I still can't help but feel that our solar neighbors are very far away given the spheres of interaction that I would expect.</p>

<p>Any insights?</p>
","<p>Most stars are of a solar-mass or below. The average number of companions that each stars has (in the sense of being part of binary or higher multiple systems) systems ranges from 0.75 for stars of a solar mass to approximately 0.35 (not a well-established number) for the more numerous M-dwarfs. Let's take a compromise value, say 0.5.
The separation distribution of these multiples peaks at around 50 AU for solar-type stars, reducing to about 5 AU for low-mass M dwarfs. Again, lets take a compromise value of 20 AU. See <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3028"">Duchene &amp; Kraus (2013)</a> for all the details.</p>

<p>So if we take 1000 stars, then 333 of them (roughly speaking) are companions to another 333 stars, while 333 are isolated single stars. (NB This does not mean the frequency of multiple systems is 50%, because some of the companions will be in higher order multiple systems)</p>

<p>Thus, taking your calculation of the separation between stellar systems of 5 light years ($= 3.2\times10^{5}$ AU), then the mean separation is:
$$\bar{D} = 0.667\times 20 + 0.333 \times 3.2\times10^{5} \simeq 10^{5} AU, $$
but the <em>median</em> separation is 20 AU!</p>

<p>This is of course sophistry, because I'm sure your question is really, why are stellar systems so far apart?</p>

<p>Stars (and stellar systems) are born in much denser environments. The number density of stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC - the nearest very large stellar nursery) is about 1 per cubic light year. The equivalent number for the solar neighbourhood is 0.004 stars per cubic light year. Thus the average interstellar separation in the ONC is 1 light year, but in the solar neighbourhood it is about 6.3 light years.</p>

<p>The reason for this separation at birth is the Jeans length - the critical radius at which a clouds self-gravity will overcome its thermal energy and cause it to collapse. It can be expressed as 
$$\lambda_J = c_s \left( \frac{\pi}{G\rho } \right)^{1/2},$$
where $c_s$ is the sound speed in a molecular cloud and $\rho$ its density. For star forming giant molecular clouds $c_s = 0.2$ km/s and $\rho=10^{-23}$ kg/m$^3$. So clouds of scale hundreds of light years could collapse. As they do, the density increases and the Jeans length becomes smaller and allows the cloud to fragment. Exactly how far the fragmentation goes and the distribution of stellar masses it produces is an area of intense research, but we know observationally that it can produce things like the ONC or sometimes even more massive and dense clusters.</p>

<p>From there we know that a new born cluster of stars tends not to survive very long. For various reasons - outflows, winds and ionising radiation from newborn stars are able to heat and expel the remaining gas; star formation appears to have an average efficiency of a few to perhaps 20-30%. Expelling the gas, plus the tidal field of the galaxy breaks up the cluster and disperses it into the field, which gives us the lower field star (or system) density that we see around us.</p>

<p>Once the stars are part of the field they essentially don't interact with each other; they are too far apart to feel the influence of individual objects and move subject to the overall gravitational potential of the Galaxy.
 so your consideration of the force between stars is not really relevant.</p>

"Is it possible for a virus to come from a meteorite?","2492","","<p>So I am not a true scientist and I was just wondering if an extraterrestrial rock from space can have some dangerous unidentified virus or bacteria that can be deadly and wipe out the Earth if it not quarantined. Is this science fiction?.</p>

<p>P.S.: Note I said extraterrestrial <em>rocks</em> not extraterrestrial as in aliens.</p>
","<p>There is, believe it or not, a scientific theory regarding this: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>panspermia</em></a>.</p>

<p>According to the panspermia hypothesis, microbes ""hitch"" a lift on bodies leaving a planet. They then travel through space and eventually land somewhere else.
Panspermia involves three difficult phases of travel:</p>

<ul>
<li>Launch (as well as the impact event)</li>
<li>Travel in the harsh environment of space</li>
<li>Atmospheric entry and landing, with high temperatures</li>
</ul>

<p>It's difficult to survive these. However, materials related to organic matter have been found that might be evidence of panspermia; see <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/10/14/1517557112.full.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bell et al. (2015)</a> for one example.</p>

<p>Panspermia is traditionally applied to bacteria known as <em>extremophiles</em>, which are accustomed to living in harsh environments. Space contains temperatures ranging from hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit to hundreds of degrees below zero, and any organism would have to survive those. This may be possible - <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/high-flying-bacteria-spark-interest-in-possible-climate-effects-1.12310"" rel=""noreferrer"">bacteria have survived in conditions like there</a> - but difficult.</p>

<p>Viruses pose an additional challenge because they cannot survive long without a host organism on which to live. This means they would have to be carried along by an extremophilic bacteria. This also means that they might not be a huge harm to creatures on Earth. Viruses only attack certain bacteria because of proteins on their surfaces; extraterrestrial biology most likely differs from that on Earth, and these viruses might not be equipped to harm terrestrial organisms.</p>

"Is it possible to see a moonrise or moonset twice in a day?","2472","","<p>I've been wondering this for quite some time.  Due to the variations in tilt from the earth we know that <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/240/how-does-moonrise-moonset-azimuth-vary-with-time"">moonrise/moonset times vary</a>.  Is it possible that in <em>any</em> location on the earth one might see more than one moonrise or moonset in a given 24 hour period?</p>
","<p>This can only happen if the moonrise at a certain date is earlier than the moonrise at the previous day. There are two reasons why this could happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>The body (Moon, Mars,...) moves in the opposite direction of the Sun viewed along the right ascension (or elliptical longitude) axis. The sidereal day is 4 minutes shorter than 24 hours which means that a static celestial body (a star) will rise 4 minutes earlier than the day before. However planetary bodies move (more or less) along the ecliptic, which is the Sun's path during the year along the celestial sphere. The Sun moves on average 4 minutes in elliptical longitude (and hence in right ascension with a bit more variation) every day. So for a body to rise earlier, the body would have to move slower along the celestial sphere than the Sun (or move in a retrograde direction). This is true for the outer planets (including mars) but not for the Moon, which moves in the same direction as the Sun and much faster (one orbit per month).</li>
<li>If the observer is at a sufficient high latitude on Earth (either north or south of the equator), the inclination of the celestial equator will be small enough so that a body that increases its declination rapidly enough will be able to rise earlier on the second day. </li>
</ol>

<p>See for instance the figure below where each drawing is at the same time of day. The moon will increase its right ascension during the day (along the celestial equator downwards, the red arrow in the figure). If the observer is on the Earth's equator, moonrise will be later the next day. It does not matter whether the declination (the position above or below the celestial equator (to the left or right in the figure)) will increase or decrease. All objects with the same right ascension will rise at the same time on the equator. If the observer is not on the equator but near one of the poles (for instance at 65° latitude north), the increase in declination may be sufficient to counteract the increase in right ascension (see bottom panel). Note that even though  the right ascension increases (the moon moves left along the celestial equator axis), the Moon will rise earlier during the day.</p>

<p>This only works (in the Northern hemisphere) when the Moon increases its declination (the height above the celestial equator) very rapidly. This happen only when the Moon is near the Vernal Equinox (i.e. in Aries or Pisces). And the observer needs to be at a high latitude (i.e. near the North pole such as Thule as mentioned by @barrycarter)

Though because the Sun is much more massive, the center of mass lies very close to the center of the star (except in the case of Jupiter, where the CoM lies outside of the sun and is approx the length of its radius). This is why all planets in our solar system orbit around the sun. This will indeed cause a slight perturbation of orbital alignment, but I don't believe it's significant.</p>

"How can we avoid needing a leap year/second?","2397","","<p>Given the Earth's current speed around the sun and current rate &amp; axis of rotation, what is the best way to keep time to avoid a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year"">leap year</a>?

","<p>Leap years exist for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are not an integer number of days in a year.</li>
<li>People perceive a need to keep the seasons where they are on the calendar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the above, there is no way to avoid leap years, or something similar. Defining the calendar year as being a fixed number of days (e.g., 365 days) would result in the seasons shifting by one day per four years.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Leap seconds exist for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The length of a day as measured by an atomic clock is not constant.</li>
<li>People perceive a need to keep midnight at midnight, noon at noon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the above, there is no way to avoid leap seconds, or something similar. Defining the day as being a fixed number of atomic clock seconds (e.g., 86400) would result in your clock and the Sun disagreeing on mean local noon, but by a very small amount.</p>

<p>That said, there are serious proposals to eliminate leap seconds. Some people such as those who use UTC to timestamp financial transactions do not like them. So far, those proposals have been rejected. The standard response is that it's not UTC that's broken; it's using of UTC in a context where it shouldn't be used that is broken. If you need a monotonically increasing time scale, use TAI or GPS time instead.</p>

"How to identify stars in photographs?","2396","","<p>I can look at a star chart and identify things like constellations in the sky.  But if I take a picture with my DSLR camera (35mm with a decent zoom lens, no astronomy specific optics), I run into difficulty. I find that the camera can see a lot more stars than my eye, and I find that I start to have great difficulty even identifying simply constellations.  For instance, when I look for the constellation Cassiopeia in the night sky it is very easy to spot: it looks like a sideways ""W"".  But when I take a picture I don't see a W at all in the picture, I see about 16 stars around where the ""W"" should be a weird angles to each other, and it's hard to figure out which stars to connect to form the actual constellation.</p>

<p>And it just goes downhill from there, as other constellations don't even have a shape as easily recognizable as Cassiopeia, and as a result I have a great deal of difficult even recognizing what I am looking at.</p>

<p>A photograph with a regular camera is not quite the same as looking through a telescope, because the camera has a much wider field of view.  And at the same time, there does not seem to be a linear relationship between the actual magnitude of the star and how bright it looks.  As I mentioned above, I see 16 stars which look somewhat comparable in brightness, but I know that they differ by several magnitudes.</p>

<p>Is there some kind of trick or technique that I can use to quickly identify stars in pictures I take?  In looking for clues, I have not seen anybody mentioning this problem.</p>
","<p>Take another photograph of the same field that is less exposed. (Doesn't matter if you do this by shortening the exposure time, decreasing the ISO, etc.) This will give you an image with far fewer stars so you can easily pattern match your images. </p>

<p>My physics teacher told me once, that a black hole is just a very small-sized and heavy object which has so much gravity that nothing at all, not even light can't escape of its gravity. This explanation is also supported by this <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/70/if-nothing-travels-at-the-speed-of-light-except-light-how-can-a-black-hole-als"">SE.astronomy - If nothing travels at the speed of light, except light, how can a black hole also pull light into itself?</a> question.</p>

<li><p>How can a supermassive black hole be able to pull matter, but not the light photons of the energy?</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally: Why is part of the matter which is pulled into the black hole flung (i.e. <strong>accelerated</strong>) into the universe? I understand why this matter is maybe divided - the acceleration increases as far as i know quadratic, i.e. the differences in terms of the actual acceleration, in dependence of the location may be so huge that the matter can't be held together. But i don't understand why a part of the matter is accelerated in the exact <strong>opposite</strong> direction, as a force <strong>bigger</strong> as the gravity of the supermassive black hole would be needed. Therefore: Why is a part of the matter accelerated in the opposite direction (i.e. out of the black hole's gravity) than the other part?</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><em>Note: My physics education is rather limited. I.e. i know a bit about the Newtonian gravity and a bit about the theory of Conservation of energy. But that's already alll i know about physics.</em></p>
","<p>It is quite correct that a black hole has so much mass that light cannot escape from a region around the black hole. The edge of this region is called the event horizon. If you cross an event horizon you are never coming back. That applies equally to light, and matter.</p>

<p>Around the black hole there may be matter in orbit. Since the Black hole has such strong gravity, the speed of the orbiting matter will be very fast. In fact it will be close to the speed of light. This high speed gives it lots of energy. The matter will form a disc, called an accretion disc, around the black hole, and collisions in this disc will cause the matter to heat up, to millions of degrees. At these temperatures, the disc will glow with X-rays.</p>

<p>On the part of the disc closest to the black hole, matter will be falling in from the disc, but before it reaches the black hole it can get enough energy to be ejected out, at very high speed, close to the speed of light. It gets ejected at right angles to the disc, at the poles of the black hole. These are the ""jets"". Intense radiation is produced along these jets. Blazars are distant supermassive black holes with jets that are pointed right at us.</p>

<p>So the black hole itself is ""black"", but the matter orbiting around it may be very bright.</p>

"Is the moon ""perfectly"" tidally locked and, if not, how long would it take us to observe it's rotation?","2376","","<p>I have a general understanding of how and why a body in space can be tidally locked to it's planet or sun and I'm aware that our moon is in such a state.</p>

<p>My question is, if our moon once had a rotation, has it slowed down to a point where across the course of our normal lifetimes we can't observe it's spin but across the span of hundreds, if not thousands, of years we could observe its current rotation?  In other words, if it has a rotation and if I looked at the moon today and jumped into the future, how far would I have to go to see a noticeable difference?  </p>

<p>If the question is to relative then I'll ask it like this-- at the moons current rate of rotational speed and deceleration, how long would it take for the moon to rotate, say, 15 degrees on it's current axis?  I assume this would be enough to make the moon look ""different"" to the naked eye so I'll go with that concrete figure.</p>

<p>...or is the moon in either a state of near-equilibrium or is it ""wobbling"" due to other forces outside the gravitational pull of the earth (e.g. pull of the sun, asteroid bombardment, comets passing by, etc.) having minor effects on its rotational state and thus making it's rotation inconsistent and unobservable?</p>
","<p>The question is interesting, but I suspect the answer is that the Moon will never show its ""dark side"" to the Earth, because there are differences between the side that faces us and the dark side that suggest there is something quite permanent about its orientation.  So while the rotation was locking, it either settled into a state of minimum potential that it has maintained ever since, or it built up the differences between the side we see and the side we don't after it tidally locked, but either way, this means it has showed us the same side for billions of years, so will likely continue to do that.  I don't think anything would likely knock it out, but we can't rule out chaotic orbital effects so I don't really know.  The Moon's orbit varies a lot with time, so maybe it's possible that the orbit itself could change, showing us the other side of the Moon.  Or, an asteroid hit or some such thing might occur.  A billion years is a long time, but I'll bet humanity will always see the same side from Earth.</p>

"How dense are Saturn's rings?","2371","","<p>I assume that the A ring is the densest, but I might be wrong. Nevertheless, I failed to find any explicit information over the net about the minimum and maximum of densities for the different rings. As a less practical question: what would one see upon entering one of the denser rings? Would it be obvious that it is a dense but thin (few metres - 1 km) cloud of particles, continuously bombarding the spacecraft irregardless whether it orbits along within the ring, or one would not see more than just a distant haze (if lit by the Sun) that spans over the horizon?</p>
","<p><strong>Elements of answer</strong>:</p>

<p>It is not an easy question, as we lack of data to constrain strongly the density and mass of Saturn's rings.</p>

<p>However, a first clue of their density is their <strong>optical depth</strong> (that is a measure of the transparency of a medium). The densest rings are the one of the <em>main ring system</em> (rings A, Cassini Division, B and C) plus ring F; they are characterized by optical depth larger than 0.1 (up to about 5 for the densest part of ring B). Rings in the <em>faint ring system</em> (E and G) have very small optical depth (lower than $10^{-5}$). </p>

<p>With this regard, B is indeed the densest ring of Saturn's rings. <strong>(edit)</strong> Looking around (<a href=""http://caps.gsfc.nasa.gov/simpson/kingswood/rings/"" rel=""noreferrer"">[1]</a> and <a href=""http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/files/questions_answers.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">[2]</a>) you can find numbers that help to figure out the density of this ring. Knowing its mass (about $2.8\times10^9$ kg) and its extend (from 1.527 to 1.951 Saturn radii, with a typical thickness of 100 m), you can deduce a mean density of about 0.0167 g.m$^{-3}$ (about $10^5$ times less dense than the terrestrial atmosphere at sea level).</p>

<p><strong>Just for fun:</strong></p>

<p>This gives you an idea of what means the optical depth. In the densest parts of ring B, optical depth is between 2.5 and 5, so you'll definitely notice you're in the ring. It is probably more complicated than that (with ring particles ranging from dust size to house size), but you get the idea.

<p><strong>Side note:</strong></p>

<p>Optical depth is a measure of transparency of one medium; it measures how radiation is neither scattered nor absorbed by the medium. It expression is given by</p>

<p>$$\frac{I}{I_0} = {\rm e}^{-\tau}$$</p>

"When did the Moon stop?","2349","","<p>According to various theories the Moon was created around 4.5 billion years ago. About all of these theories suggest that it was rotating around its axis at that time though. Currently, Moon is at tidal lock with Earth, despite some monthly ""wiggling"" a flat zero on the long-term rotation speed relative to it.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask when did that stop occur - relative to Moon's age, how long was the period of rotating Moon?</p>

<p>The answer would shed some light on my other question - <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/1850/why-are-most-lunar-maria-on-the-visible-side"">Why are most lunar maria on the visible side?</a> as Earth tends to catch or deflect many bodies heading for Moon surface from ""our"" direction - still, there is no erosion on the Moon, so craters once formed are extremely slow to vanish - if that period was relatively long, Earth's ""protection"" wouldn't explain the maria, as rotating Moon would get 'cratered' uniformly all over its surface.</p>
","<p>""Protection"" isn't the only effect of Earth. <a href=""http://www.scientificpsychic.com/etc/timeline/moon-asteroid-impacts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is a different POV</a>: Earth may have accelerated impactors by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist"" rel=""nofollow"">gravity assist</a>.</p>

<p>A different approch is the thinner crust, as suggested for the near side, which may have allowed asteroids to penetrate Moon's crust, such that lava could flow into the basins, or which may have favoured volcanism on the near side (see ""Lunar interior"" on <a href=""http://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_images.asp?id=5"" rel=""nofollow"">this site</a>).</p>

<p>A third approach is the protective property of Earth preventing the near side to be covered with many new craters, hence leave the maria visible.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> the time to lock tidally is about
$$t_{\mbox{lock}}=\frac{wa^6IQ}{3G{m_p}^2k_2R^5},$$
with $$I=0.4m_sR^2.$$
For Moon $k_2/Q = 0.0011$, hence
$$t_{\mbox{lock,Moon}}=121\frac{wa^6m_s}{G{m_p}^2R^3}.$$
With <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"" rel=""nofollow"">Earth</a>'s mass $m_p=5.97219\cdot 10^{24}\mbox{ kg}$, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"" rel=""nofollow"">Moon</a>'s mass $m_s=7.3477\cdot 10^{22}\mbox{ kg}$, Moon's mean radius of $R=1737.10\mbox{ km}$, $G=6.672\cdot 10^{-11}\frac{\mbox{Nm}^2}{\mbox{kg}^2}$we get
$$t_{\mbox{lock,Moon}}=121\frac{wa^67.3477\cdot 10^{22}\mbox{ kg}}{6.672\cdot 10^{-11}\frac{\mbox{Nm}^2}{\mbox{kg}^2}\cdot{(5.97219\cdot 10^{24}\mbox{ kg})}^2(1737.10\mbox{ km})^3},$$
or
$$t_{\mbox{lock,Moon}}=7.12753\cdot 10^{-25}wa^6 \frac{\mbox{kg}}{\mbox{Nm}^2 \mbox{km}^3}.$$
Parameters are $w$ the spin rate in radians per second, and $a$ the semi-major axis of the moon orbit.</p>

<p>If we take the the current simi-major axis of the moon orbit of 384399 km
and a maximum possible spin rate of
$$w=v/(2\pi R)=\frac{2.38 \mbox{ km}/\mbox{s}}{2\pi\cdot 1737.10\mbox{ km}}=\frac{1}{4586 \mbox{ s}},$$
with $v=2.38 \mbox{ km}/\mbox{s}$, Moon's escape velocity, 1737.1 km Moon's radius,
we get
$$t_{\mbox{lock,Moon}}=7.12753\cdot 10^{-25}\cdot \frac{1}{4586 \mbox{ s}}\cdot (384399\mbox{ km})^6 \frac{\mbox{kg}}{\mbox{Nm}^2 \mbox{km}^3}\\
=501416\mbox{ s}^{-1}\cdot \mbox{ km}^6 \frac{\mbox{kg}}{\mbox{Nm}^2 \mbox{km}^3}=
5.01416\cdot 10^{14} \mbox{ s}.$$
That's about 16 million years, as an upper bound.</p>

<p>If we assume a higher <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_number"" rel=""nofollow"">Love number</a> for the early moon, or slower initial rotation, the time may have been shorter.</p>

<p>The time for getting locked is very sensitive to the distance Earth-Moon (6th power). Hence if tidal locking occurred closer to Earth, the time will have been shorter, too. That's likely, because Moon is spiraling away from Earth.</p>

<p>Has the merger of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star"" rel=""noreferrer"">neutron star</a> binaries <em>been necessary to explain</em> abundances of the heavy elements such as gold and platinum, or is this just an anecdotal item? How important are binary neutron stars for the abundances of heavy elements such as gold? Is there a particular or notable paper I can read on this?</p>

<p>I have already read <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/23160/7982"">this answer</a> but I'm looking for a better explanation of the need for this kind of merger to explain abundances. I'm pretty sure there is nothing in any observed gamma ray events that shows spectral lines of gold or any identifiable heavy element (due to the incredible doppler broadening), so the connection must actually come from simulations.</p>
","<p>The creation of some very heavy neutron-rich elements, like gold and platinum, requires the rapid capture of neutrons. This will only occur in dense, explosive conditions where the density of free neutrons is large. For a long time, the competing theories and sites for the r-process have been inside core-collapse supernovae and during the merger of neutron stars.</p>

<p>My understanding is that it has become increasingly difficult for supernovae to produce (in theoretical models) sufficient r-process elements to match both the quantity and detailed abundance ratios of r-process elements in the solar system (see for example <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/312/4/042008/meta;jsessionid=F07BC1557DE69F29EB2F59B976ED49C5.ip-10-40-2-120"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wanajo et al. 2011</a>; <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2527"" rel=""noreferrer"">Arcones &amp; Thielmann 2012</a>). The conditions required, particularly a very neutron-rich environment in the neutrino-driven winds, are just not present without the fine tuning of parameters (see below).</p>

<p>Instead, the models invoking neutron star mergers are much more robust to theoretical uncertainties and successfully produce r-process elements. The question mark appears to be only over their frequency at various times in the evolution of a galaxy and exactly how much enriched material is ejected.</p>

<p>The announcement of GW170817 makes this all more plausible. A neutron star merger has been seen. The behaviour of the optical and infrared emission after the event matches the expectations of merging neutron star models (e.g. <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaap/ncurrent/full/nature24298.html?foxtrotcallback=true"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pian et al. 2017</a>; <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa90b6/meta"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tanvir et al. 2017</a>). Of particular note is the developing  opacity and fading in the blue and  visible, with the spectrum 
becoming dominated by the  infrared with broad spectral features. This is the expectation for an expanding cloud of material that is heavily polluted by the presence of lanthanides and other r-process elements (<a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa905c/meta"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chornock et al. 2017</a>). The reasonable agreement between the observations and models suggests that indeed a large quantity of r-process elements were produced in this explosion.</p>

<p>To go from there to the claim that the origin of gold is solved (as claimed in the press conference) is a step too far. The amount of r-process material produced has large uncertainties and is model-dependent.
The rate of mergers is only constrained to about an order of magnitude <em>in the local universe</em> and is not measured/known in the early universe. What could be said is that this channel for r-process production has been directly observed and so must be taken into account.</p>

<p>On the other hand, r-process production by the supernova channel is not yet ruled out. Some simulations at least, that involve rotation and magnetic fields appear to be still ""in the game"" (e.g. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06567"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nishimura et al. 2016</a>). It could be that the presence of significant r-process material in very old metal-poor stars requires a supernova channel, since the merger of neutron stars takes some considerable time to occur (e.g. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02954"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cescutti et al. 2015</a>; <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02405"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cote et al. 2017</a>).</p>

<p>However we know nothing about it's atmosphere (or lack of one). The star is a red dwarf, so it could be subject to dramatic solar flares. The planet is rather colder than earth, so could be in a perpetual ""snowball world"" state, depending on the composition of the atmosphere and the strength of the greenhouse effect. The atmosphere would be very unlikely to be even close to breathable, and it is nearly 500 light-years from Earth, so could not be reached in a reasonable amount of time, even with much more advanced propulsion.</p>

They will cross the moon's disc in less than a second, and transits are rare, as each is a path only 7km wide. at any one time, a transit is visible from less than 100th of 1% of the Earth's surface.

"Is everything quantum entangled?","2262","","<p>So, I am learning about quantum entanglement in my quantum course and had a thought. If the Big Bang is the creation of everything - time included, and this came from a single ""source"". Would it not follow that all particles in the universe are entangled to each other? And perhaps, we cannot observe this entanglement because we are ""inside the system"" sort to speak. Are we not all connected? </p>

<p>I know the last part is cheesy, but the point is serious.  </p>
","<p>By far the most particles in the visible universe aren't quantum entangled. That's obvious from observation, since if all electron spins e.g. would be entangled, all electrons would flip their spin at the same time, and we couldn't observe varying statistics of electron spins in a sample, resulting in varying degrees of magnetism, e.g. by applying gradually changing exterior magnetic fields.</p>

<p>A second example: All (bosonic) atoms of spin 0 would form a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate"">Bose-Einstein condensate</a> not just near absolute zero, since they would be in the same quantum state, hence in the lowest.</p>

<p>The ""single source"" isn't a single quantum state. In the early phase of the big bang temperatures were very high, allowing for a huge amount of possible quantum states within a small volume. Without warranty you may think of the initial state of the universe as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition"">superposition</a> of all possible quantum states, the wave functions of which collapse relative to an observer, regarding the observer as a particular quantum state.</p>

It is an educational simulation game based on astronomy and anything space, it ranges from supernova animations to climate and atmospheric simulations (and of course collisions) but do any of these features hold water? Do they truly resemble the dynamics of space?</p>
","<p>Not sure if these kinds of questions are allowed here, but I may as well answer it.</p>

<p>Universe Sandbox 2 is mostly realistic. Its accuracy degrades as you increase the flow of time. The slower the time, the more accurate the calculations. This
means that if you want to simulate the Solar System over a long period of time, it won't be very accurate. If you want to simulate day-long events, like planets crashing, it might be better.</p>

<p>However, Universe Sandbox 2 uses 300-year old Newtonian physics, rather than general relativity. Newtonian physics just requires n-body mechanics, so it is much easier to implement. General relativity requires simulating the spacetime itself. That is, taking your simulation space, discretizing it to a hi-res 3-D grid and checking the effect that each and every point in that grid has on all neighboring points at every timestep.</p>

<p>Instead of simulating N number of bodies, they would be simulating a huge number of points. They would start with some initial data of the shape of spacetime and then see how it evolves according to the Einstein equations, which are 10 highly non-linear partial differential equations. Accurate general relativity simulations require supercomputers.</p>

<p>Still, Newtonian physics can get the job done for the most part. The developers seem interested in incorporating some GR concepts, like gravity propagating at the speed of light, spinning black holes and ways to better approximate GR.</p>

"Why do astronomers like green laser pointers?","2224","","<p>When I've been to Astronomy-nights for the public at the local observatory, they always used green lasers to point things out.</p>

<p>Why is there such a preference for green lasers?</p>

<p>What's wrong with red lasers? (Which seem cheaper and more readily available.)</p>
","<p>Mostly general purpose laser pointers are used for pointing things at smaller distances eg. Diagram or Equations in Powerpoint presentations, so the power of such laser pointers is quite limited/restricted to 5mw ( Class 3A or IIIa) or 10mW in some regions.
Because of the low power and small aperture of laser pointers if you point them through empty space, you can only see them impact spot where it hits a surface.</p>

<p>So to point stars/planets as in astronomy club during observation sessions these low power laser pointers are not useful as there is no surface where the beam can hit &amp; you can see the spot.</p>

<p>Some higher-powered laser pointers project a visible beam via scattering from dust particles or water droplets along the beam path.
Higher-power ( Class 3B or IIIb lasers: greater than 5mW) and higher-frequency (Green or Blue) lasers may produce a beam visible even in clean air because of ""Rayleigh Scattering"" from air molecules, especially when viewed in moderately-to-dimly lit conditions. The strong wavelength dependence of the scattering (~λ^ −4 ) means that shorter (green &amp; blue) wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer (red) wavelengths.</p>

<p>[ Rayleigh scattering is the mainly the elastic scattering (in lay term collision) of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light.
Rayleigh scattering results from the electric polarizability of the particles (locally separating positive &amp; negative charges by small distance apart inside the atom. i.e. temporarily separating centre of positive charge and centre of negative charge). The oscillating electric field of a light wave acts on the charges within a particle, causing them to move at the same frequency (hence the green colour). The particle therefore becomes a small radiating dipole (or small sources of light) whose radiation we see as scattered light (the beam passing from pointer to star pointed). ]</p>

<p>The intensity of such scattering increases when these beams are viewed from angles near the beam axis. (That's the reason, if you are standing close to the person pointing stars in astronomy club, you can see the beam bright and clearly whereas the people standing away can barely see it. So always stand near the presenter But avoid contact with your eye. :-) )</p>

<p>The apparent brightness of a spot from a laser beam depends on the optical power of the laser, the reflectivity of the surface, and the chromatic response of the human eye. For the same optical power, Green Laser light will seem brighter than other colours because the human eye is most sensitive at low light levels in the green region of the spectrum (wavelength 520–570 nm). The most sensitive pigment, rhodopsin, has a peak response at 500 nm. Sensitivity decreases for redder or bluer wavelengths.</p>

<p>Further, Green laser pointers are of moderate power (sufficient for Rayleigh  Scattering in clean air), they are compact and relatively cheaper than blue ones (even though human eye is less sensitive to blue colour, blue laser are a little bit more expensive than green one.)</p>

<p>Avoid their contact with your eyes and don't point them at aircraft.
People have been given up to five years in jail for aiming a green laser at an aircraft.</p>

"Why don't we have 2 Summers and 2 Winters?","2218","","<p>Due to Earth's elliptical orbit, its distance from Sun varies by almost <strong>5 million Kilometers</strong> (147 million Kilometers at closest point &amp; 152 million Kilometers at farthest point, i.e. almost 3% of the average distance).</p>

<p>As evident from the fact that that Venus has hotter environment than Mars due to their respective distances from the sun.</p>

<p>Why then Earth does not observe two winters (at farthest points) and two summers (at closest points)?</p>

<p><strong>Additional Note</strong>:
I know that Earth's seasonal climate change is caused by its 23 degrees tilt that causes the sunlight density variations for the hemispheres.</p>

<p>But to me this <strong>5 million Km</strong> distance seems more relevant than the 23 degrees tilt.</p>
","<p>There are a few incorrect assumptions in your post, so it is difficult to answer as asked. But I can address the misconceptions.</p>

<p><strong>1. The seasons are not caused by our distance from the sun</strong><br>
The seasons are caused by the 23.5° tilt in Earth's axis. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun (summer), the Southern Hemisphere is simultaneously tilted <em>away</em> from the sun (winter). So the seasonal temperature difference has little to do with the Earth's position in its elliptical orbit. Without this tilt, there would be no seasons and the temperature day to day across the globe would be relatively uniform. </p>

<p><strong>2. Even the GLOBAL temperature is NOT consistent with our change in distance</strong><br>
As a matter of fact, the <em>average</em> temperature of the Earth globally is <strong><em>hottest</em> when it is the <em>furthest</em></strong> from the sun &mdash; hotter by about 2.3°C (<a href=""http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/12/the-earth-is-hottest-when-it-is-furthest-from-the-sun-on-its-orbit-not-when-it-is-closest/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ref</a>). That's because there is a lot more landmass in the Northern Hemisphere facing the sun (when Earth is <em>farthest</em> away in its orbit). So even though there is less intensity of sunlight, the land is able to be heated up much faster than the vast oceans which have to be heated at perihelion.</p>

<p>This distance-temperature inconsistency isn't unique to the Earth. Look at the average temperature of the <em>other</em> inner planets as we move away from the sun:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mercury (167°C)</li>
<li>Venus (460°C)  <strong>&larr; <em>farther, but hotter than Mercury?</em></strong></li>
<li>Earth (14.0°C)</li>
<li>Mars (-60°C)</li>
</ol>

<p>Venus is actually warmer than Mercury because of the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere causing runaway global warming. So it isn't simply the distance from the sun that determines the average temperature of a planet.</p>

<p><strong>3. There's only ONE aphelion/perihelion</strong><br>
The closest point of the Earth's orbit (perihelion) and the farthest (aphelion) only happens <strong>once</strong> per year; not twice. That is because the elliptical orbit of the Earth is such so the sun is at one of the foci, not the center (as illustrated below).</p>

A photon leaving Alpha Centauri would see the universe all at once, in a infinitesimal small unit of time (if directed out to space). </p>

","<p>Speed of light being finite is one of the fundamentals of our Universe.</p>

<p>If it were infinite, this would have a major implication in causality.</p>

<p>Besides, in non-quantum physics, light is just an electromagnetic wave. Eelectromagnetic field is described by Maxwell's equations, which predict that the speed $c$ of electromagnetic waves propagating through the vacuum depends on the dielectric permittivity $ε_0$ and the magnetic permeability $μ_0$ by the equation $c = {1\over\sqrt{ε_{0}μ_{0}}}$ so you can not have an infinite speed of light unless electric permittivity or magnetic permeability were zero, which in turn would cause all sorts of odd things to electromagnetical attraction (and thus, to matter existence beyond elemental particles).</p>

"How Would a Neutron Star Actually Appear?","2189","","<p>Having seen many pictures produced by artists of neutron stars and planets that orbit some of them, I was wondering how a pulsar would appear to a human being, in visible light (assuming the intense radiation etc. doesn't kill us in the process).</p>

<p>As I understand, the pulsar's beam is projected from the star's magnetic poles rather than rotational poles, which are not necessarily in line with each other. Given that pulsars rotate extremely quickly and the beam could be visible across vast distances - such as if it were shining through the pulsar's nebula - would it appear as a straight line, curved line or perhaps a cone? This is assuming the beam can be seen in visible light.</p>

<p>Given the incredible density of neutron stars and their small physical sizes, would the night sky be visibly distorted to the point where (for example) just after sunset on a hypothetical planet, one could possibly observe other planets near or behind the star that would otherwise be blocked by it?</p>

<p>Given their small surface areas, would a neutron star still appear as luminous as say, the Sun, at a similar distance? How close would you have to get to a neutron star for its apparent magnitude to match the Sun's from Earth?</p>
","<p>Your question is too general, you need to get to specific examples.</p>

<p>First, very few neutron stars are pulsars. Pulsars are either a brief phase during a pulsar's spin-down at the start of a neutron star's life, or they are the product of the spin-<em>up</em> of a neutron star in a binary system. Most neutron stars fall in neither of these categories.</p>

<p>A standard neutron star will look like any other star at a similar temperature. Most of them will be very hot indeed - 100,000 K or more, though the cooling histories of neutron stars are still uncertain and depend on some exotic physics. Such an object is ""white hot"" - it emits black body radiation at all frequencies visible to the eye (as well as lots more at UV wavelengths).</p>

<p>How close would you have to get for it's apparent luminosity/magnitude to match the Sun? Well that depends on the size and temperature of the neutron star. Most are thought to have a diameter of 20 km. The way you would do the calculation is equate the blackbody radiative flux per unit area at a given distance to the solar radiation constant of about 1300 W per square metre. However, there are two wrinkles for a neutron star: First, the radiation is gravitationally redshifted, so the temperature we measure is lower than the temperature at the surface. Second, General Relativity tells us that we can see more than just a hemisphere of the neutron star - i.e. we can see around the back - and this increases the flux we observe. These are roughly factor of two effects, so just to get an order of magnitude estimate, ignore GR and assume a 10 km radius NS with $T=10^{5}$ K.</p>

<p>Using Stefan's law for a blackbody, then at a distance $d$, we have that
$$\frac{4 \pi r^2}{4\pi d^2} \sigma T^4 = 1300\ W\ m^{-2},$$
where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.</p>

<p>For $r=10$ km, then $d=7 \times 10^{8}$ m, which is coincidentally about a solar radius. Of course this distance depends on the square of the temperature, so a younger NS with $T=10^6$ K, then $d \sim 1$ au. </p>

<p>These are the distances where the total flux at all wavelengths would be similar to that from the Sun. To do the calculation just for the visible range we need to account for the bolometric correction, which converts a visual magnitude to a bolometric magnitude. The bolometric correction for the Sun is $\sim 0$, whereas the bolometric correction for a very hot star could be -5 mag. This means that only 1% as much flux from the hot neutron star emerges in the visible band compared with sunlight. This means that the distances calculated above, if we require the <em>visual</em> brightness of the neutron star be similar to the Sun, must be reduced by a factor of 10.</p>

<p>To turn to pulsars. Note that the pulsed radiation <em>does</em> have an optical component and pulsed optical radiation has been seen from a number of pulsars. Optical synchrotron emission would just appear to be a periodic, intense brightening of the pulsar, as the beam sweeps across the line of sight. If you were not in the line of sight, then you would not see the pulsed optical emission. If you could observe the beam passing through nebulosity or some other medium around the pulsar then yes there may well be some effects you could see in terms of ionisation or scattered light coming from along the beam path.</p>

<p>Lastly, the gravitational lensing effect. Yes, this should be strong close to a neutron star. The deflection angle (in radians) is given by
$$ \alpha  = \frac{4GM}{c^2 b},$$
where $b$ is how close the light passes to the neutron star and $M$ is the neutron star mass. Expressing $b$ in terms of the 10km radius of the neutron star:
$$ \alpha \simeq 0.83 \left(\frac{M}{1.4M_{\odot}}\right) \left(\frac{b}{10 km}\right)^{-1},$$
where strictly speaking this formula is only valid for $\alpha \ll 1$.</p>

<p>So consider a planet directly behind the neutron star at a distance of 1 au. The light from this would only need to be bent through an angle of $\sim 2 \times 10\ km/1\ au \sim 10^{-7}$ radians in order to be seen from a planet diametrically opposite at a distance of 1 au. So this is easily possible. However, the image would likely be highly distorted, especially if the neutron star was spinning. It would not look dissimilar to this simulated black hole image, but with a bright neutron star in the middle rather than a black disc.</p>

"What mechanism causes oscillations of the solar system's orbit about the galactic plane?","2155","","<p>In a <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0576"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recent paper</a> (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/did-dark-matter-kill-the-dinosaurs-1.14839"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">news release here</a>) Lisa Randall and Matthew Reece propose that a dark matter disk coinciding with the galactic plane together with the solar system's oscillations through the galactic plane could explain the 35 million year periodicity in mass extinctions.  They propose that the solar system passes through this dark matter disk in the galactic plane every 35 million years, disrupting bodies in the Oort cloud and causing some of them to collide with Earth.  An image of the proposed cycles from the news release is below.</p>

<p>My question is: What mechanism is responsible for this 35 million year oscillation about the galactic plane?  Is there a companion body to the sun? Are we orbiting around one of the arms of our galaxy?  Is this a well known phenomenon or are they proposing the 35 million year oscillation as well as the dark matter disk?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DfAo0.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The cause for the oscillations perpendicular to the galactic plane is the gravity of the non-spherical mass distribution (needed for a plane <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_orbit"">Kepler ellipse</a>) in the Milky Way. Simplified, there is a dense galactic plane. The density is not exactly known; therefore there is some uncertainty (a few million years) about the precise oscillation period. Details see <a href=""http://www.phys.huji.ac.il/~shaviv/articles/ShavivChapter.pdf"">this article</a>, subsection 3.3.</p>

<p>The idea of a <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v308/n5961/abs/308712a0.html"">correlation of mass extinctions with this oscillation</a> isn't new, it originates back probably to about 1970, or earlier.</p>

<p>""The outer solar system probably does not contain a large gas giant planet, or a small, companion star"", see <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/march/nasas-wise-survey-finds-thousands-of-new-stars-but-no-planet-x/#.UymjCqh5Oqg"">this press release</a>.</p>

According to Wikipedia, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon"">the orbit of the Moon</a> is slightly tilted, and our own earth also tilts from time to time.

Which are the areas that always see the northern look or the southern one throughout the year?</p>
","<p>This doesn't really answer your question, but the orientation of the moon is changing constantly, because we tend to compare the moon to the horizon, and think of the horizon as fixed.

<p>If you were changing location, you would see a similar gradual effect.</p>

<p>The only real place you would see a true ""flip"" is near where the moon is at zenith (overhead), because, as you passed the zenith point, the moon may go from being 89.999 degrees high in the western sky to 89.999 degrees high in the eastern sky (and flip directions because you're now comparing it to a different horizon).</p>

"Explosions of black holes","2096","","<p>I was bopping around YouTube and observed this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nHBGFKLHZQ"">enjoyably produced video</a>. In it, when describing the behavior of a black hole with the mass of a US nickel, the narrator says, ""Its 5 grams of mass will be converted to 450 terajoules of energy, which will lead to an explosion roughly three times bigger than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.""</p>

<p>Of all the fun things illustrated there, that was the one whose pretense I didn't understand. Do black holes explode after they've radiated away all of their mass? Or would the ""explosion"" just come from the rapid pace at which the black hole would consume nearby matter?</p>

<p>The Googling I've done thus far has provided no firm answer. The closest I've come is from the Wikipedia page on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation"">Hawking Radiation</a>, which states, ""For a black hole of one solar mass, we get an evaporation time of 2.098 × 10^67 years—much longer than the current age of the universe at 13.799 ± 0.021 x 10^9 years. But for a black hole of 10^11 kg, the evaporation time is 2.667 billion years. This is why some astronomers are searching for signs of exploding primordial black holes.""</p>

<p>Some other websites refer to the last ""explosion"" of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole being some 2 million years ago, but is that the same mechanic mentioned on the Wikipedia page? Or the YouTube video, for that matter?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. =)</p>
","<p>What this video is talking about is Hawking Radiation, as you've linked. Hawking Radiation is a proposed hypothetical (by no means verified or proven) way for a black hole to radiate its energy into space. The basic idea is that a black hole is nothing but mass/energy compressed to an infinitesimal point, which is radiating its energy into space over time. For large black holes (such as solar mass or bigger), this radiation process is tiny and the time taken to leak all the black hole's energy into space (and thus for the black hole to ""evaporate"") is exceedingly long. For tiny black holes however, the time to radiate all the black hole's energy is exceedingly short.</p>

<p>You can calculate how long it will take for a black hole of mass $m$ to evaporate (and release all its mass/energy) with the equation</p>

<p>$$t_{\text{ev}} = \frac{5120\pi G^2 m^3}{\hbar c^4} = (8.41\times 10^{-17}\:\mathrm{s}\:\mathrm{kg}^{-3})\:m^3$$</p>

<p>For $m = 5\:\mathrm{g}=0.005\:\mathrm{kg}$, you get $t_{\text{ev}} \simeq 4\times10^{-19}\:\mathrm{s}$. Now that means in this tiny amount of time, the black hole will radiate all of its mass/energy away and completely evaporate. But the output of all the energy in 5 g of mass is a huge output. Putting out 450 Terajoules of energy in $10^{-19}\:\mathrm{s}$ is basically just an explosion. You can determine the total energy output from the famous equation</p>

<p>$$E=mc^2$$</p>

<p>Just plug in $m = 0.005\:\mathrm{kg}$ and $c = 3\times 10^8\:\mathrm{m/s}$ and you'll get $E=4.5\times 10^{14}\:\mathrm{J} = 450\:\mathrm{Terajoules}$.</p>

<p>So in short, hypothetical calculations (not even theory at this point) suggest that a tiny black hole with the mass of a nickel would immediately explode out in a huge amount of energy. Whether such a black hole can form, or if such an evaporation would/could occur is still highly debated and ultimately unknown at this point.</p>

<p>...but I can't understand what the cloudy ribbon at the bottom the horizon is. Is it a super-large nebula? Or is it due to the Gegenschein? What happens in the ribbon?</p>
","<p>The Milky Way Galaxy is a large spiral galaxy with some characteristic features worth mentioning: </p>

<p>1) The bulge - This refers to the collection of tightly packed stars located in the central region of the galaxy.</p>

<p>2) The spiral arms or the disk - This region extends from the inner region of the galaxy (where it meets the bulge) to outskirts of the galaxy, and contains stars, dust, and lots of gas. It's also very thin. The reason why a disk forms is largely thought to be due to slight asymmetries in the accretion of material early on in the galaxy's history. Over time, and due to conservation of angular momentum, the material collapses down into a disk. Incidentally, this is where the sun lives. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QxNbg.jpg"" alt=""Diagram of galactic components.""></p>

<p>That ribbon is the disk of the Milky Way. It looks cloudy because of the dust and gas which scatters light from the rest of the galaxy. The reason why gas accumulates here is because as things begin to collapse into a disk, the gas collides with itself, and sort of 'sticks' together. In other words, where a bunch of stars may very happily pass through a bunch of other stars without many of them colliding or being disturbed, gas has a much harder time doing this. If you want to learn more about what happens when galaxies and clusters collide, take a look at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bullet Cluster</a>.  </p>

<p>The majority of the other stars you you see which are not part of that structure are much more local. The reason why the rest of the sky looks rather transparent in comparison is because you are looking out of the plane of the galaxy. There is simply much less stuff (namely gas and dust which obscures your sight in optical wavelengths) that you are looking through. Because of this, most optical telescopes look in these directions when studying the rest of the universe. </p>

"what is a Friedmann model?","2085","","<p>Can you explain what is a Friedmann model to a layman?
And also give some examples of Friedmann models, specially I would like to know if the lambda-CDM model is considered a Friedmann model.</p>
","<p>The ""Friedmann model"" is a model of the Universe governed by the Friedmann equations, which describes how the Universe expands or contracts. These equations are a solution to Einstein's field equations, and with two very important assumptions they form the basis for our understanding of the evolution and structure of our Universe. These assumptions, together called ""the cosmological principle"", are that the Universe is <em>homogeneous</em>, and that it's <em>isotropic</em>. This is a layman's explanation, so I won't write the equations here, but farther down I've added the equation and go a bit more in detail what it means.</p>

<h2>The cosmological principle</h2>

<h3>Homogeneity</h3>

<p>That the Universe is homogeneous means that its ""the same"" everywhere. Obviously, it's not, really. For instance, under your feet is a dense, rocky planet, whereas above your head there's thin air. We live in a galaxy full of stars and molecular clouds and what not, while 100,000 lightyears from the Milky Way, there is virtually nothing. But on very large scales, say above half a billion lightyears, the Universe actually looks the same all over.</p>

<h3>Isotropy</h3>

<p>That it's isotropic, means that it looks the same in all directions. Again, obviously it doesn't on small scales, but on large scales, it does. If it didn't, it would mean that we occupied a special place in the Universe, and we don't think we do.</p>

<p>So, neither of these assumptions <em>have</em> to be true, but observations tell us that apparently, they are. See this image, where every dot is a galaxy (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990MNRAS.243..692M"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maddox et al. 1990</a>):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/foijq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/foijq.jpg"" alt=""APM""></a></p>

<p>You might think that a homogeneous Universe would also be isotropic and/or vice versa, but <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/13193/5264"">that's not the case</a>.</p>

<h2>Three possible solutions</h2>

<p>It turns out that, for these assumptions, there are three possible solutions to the Friedmann equation. We call the three possible universes <em>flat</em>, <em>positively curved</em> (or ""closed""), and <em>negatively curved</em> (or ""open""). Which of these possible universes <em>we</em> live in, turns out to depend upon the average density in the Universe, so by measuring this, we can determine the ""geometry"" of our own Universe. And it seems that it's ""flat"".</p>

<h3>A flat universe</h3>

<p>The reason it's called flat is that the geometry is like that of a flat 2D table, only in 3D. That is, a triangle has 180º, parallel lines never meet, etc. And it's infinitely large. Intuitively, we'd think that this is the way the Universe is, and definitely on small scales (say within our own Galaxy), it's an adequate approximation. In the 2D analogy, the 2D surface of Earth seems flat <em>locally</em>, and for all practical purposes the parking lot outside <em>is</em> flat. But if you draw a triangle from Congo→Indonesia→the North Pole→Congo, you'd measure it's sum of angles to be roughly 270º. That's because the geometry of the surface of Earth is <em>not</em> flat, but is ""closed"".</p>

<h3>A closed universe</h3>

<p>If the Universe were ""closed"", it's geometry would, in the 2D analogy, correspond to that of the surface of a ball, i.e. a triangle has <em>more</em> than 180º, lines that start out being parallel will at some point meet, etc. But like the surface area of a ball is finite (but doesn't have a border), so is the Universe. So if you take you spaceship and fly straight away from Earth, you would end up back here (assuming the Universe doesn't collapse before you get back, or expand too fast for you).</p>

<h3>An open universe</h3>

<p>If it were ""open"", it's geometry would, in the 2D analogy, correspond to that of the surface of a saddle, i.e. a triangle has <em>less</em> than 180º, lines that start out being parallel will diverge, etc. And it's infinitely large.</p>

<p>This picture from <a href=""http://www.welchco.com/02/14/01/60/04/03/1228.HTM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> visualizes the 2D analogies.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OgZSA.gif"" alt=""geo""></p>

<p>In 3D, only a flat geometry can be pictured, and this doesn't look ""flat"" by any means; it is simply your good old 3D (""Euclidian"") space that you know from your everyday senses.</p>

<h2>Expansion of the Universe</h2>

<p>The Friedmann equation, together with the densities of the constituents of the Universe (radiation, normal matter, dark matter, and dark energy) tell us how the Universe expands. So, again by measuring these densities, we can prediect the evolution of the Universe. And it seems that the Universe not only expands, but actually <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">expands faster and faster</a>.</p>

<h2>Beyond the layman's explanation</h2>

<p>Here, I'll expand a bit on how to understand the equation:</p>

<p>The first Friedmann equation is intuitively most understandable, I think, when written like this:
$$\frac{H^2}{H_0^2} = 
\frac{\Omega_\mathrm{r,0}}{a^4} +
\frac{\Omega_\mathrm{M,0}}{a^3} +
\frac{\Omega_k}{a^2} +
      \Omega_\mathrm{\Lambda}.$$
This equation tells us the connection between the expansion rate of the Universe (the left hand side), and the density of its components and its size (the right hand side). Below, I'll go through the components of the equation.</p>

<p><strong>The Hubble parameter</strong><br>
In the equation, $H$ is the Hubble parameter describing how fast a galaxy at a given distance recedes (or approaches, for a collapsing universe), at a given time in the history of the Universe. $H_0$ is its value <em>today</em>, and is measured to be roughly $70\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. This means that a galaxy at a distance of, say, 10 Mpc ($\simeq33$ lightyears), moves away from us at a current speed of 700 km/s. A galaxy 20 Mpc away recedes at 1400 km/s, and so on (and galaxies farther away than roughly 4.3 Gpc recede faster than the speed of light, but <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/19910/5264"">that's no problem and we can still see them</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong><br>
The size of the Universe is unknown, and quite possibly infinite (lest it wouldn't be homogeneous, but to be fair, we only know that the <em>observable</em> Universe is homogeneous). Thus, we cannot talk about its absolute size. But we <em>can</em> talk about how much a certain volume of space expands in a given time. We us the parameter $a$, called the expansion factor. Defining $a$ to be 1 today, that means that at the time when the Universe was so small that all distances between the galaxies was, say, half of today's values, $a$ was equal to 0.5 (this happens to be 8 billion years ago).</p>

<p><strong>Density parameters</strong><br>
Whether the geometry of the Universe as described above is flat, closed, or open, depends on whether the <em>total</em> density $\rho_\mathrm{tot}$ is exactly equal to, above, or below a certain critical threshold $\rho_\mathrm{cr} \sim 10^{-29}\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. It is customary to parametrize the density of the $i$'th component as $\Omega\equiv \rho_i / \rho_\mathrm{cr}$.</p>

<p><strong>Matter</strong><br>
The term ""matter"" includes ""normal"" matter (gas, stars, planets, bicycles, etc.), and the mysterious dark matter. As the universe expands, the volume grows as $a^3$. That means that the density falls as $\Omega_\mathrm{M}=\Omega_\mathrm{M,0}/a^3$.</p>

<p><strong>Radiation</strong><br>
Photons redshift as space expands, and this redshift goes as $1/a$. This is in addition to having their <em>number</em> density decrease, so the total energy density of radiation decreases faster than matter, namely as $1/a^4$. Today, the energy density of radiation is <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/196373/70207"">dominated by the CMB</a>, and can be neglected, but in the early times, they would dominate.</p>

<p><strong>Curvature</strong><br>
If space is <em>not</em> flat, its curvature contributes to $\Omega_\mathrm{tot}$. The reason is that the curvature affects the volume in which we measure densities (thanks to John Davis for this explanation). This scales as $1/a^2$.</p>

<p><strong>Dark energy</strong><br>
Finally, there's the magical dark energy, of which even less is known than the dark matter. If it exists, it's thought to be a property of space itself, i.e. its energy density grows proportionally to the volume of the Universe, and thus there's no $a$-dependency.</p>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<p>From the equation, it is readily seen that if we're able to measure all the Omegas, then we know how fast the Universe has been expanding at all times. That means that we can integrate backwards in time and calculate when $a$ was 0, i.e. we can calculate the age of the Universe. Also, from the $a$-dependencies we can see when the Universe went from being <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-dominated_era"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radiation-dominated to being  matter-dominated</a>. We can also see that not only is it now dominated by dark energy (since $\Omega_\mathrm{\Lambda}\simeq0.7$, but $\Omega_\mathrm{M}\simeq0.3$), but due to the $a$ factor, it will only get ""worse"". That is, all other densities will keep decreasing, but $\rho_\Lambda$ stays the same, and since dark energy has a repulsive effect rather than attracting, the expansion of the Universe accelerates.</p>

<p>Observationally, it is found (in several <em>independent</em> ways) that <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/19395/5264"">all the $\Omega$s add up to one</a>, i.e. that the total energy density of the Universe happens to be exactly equal to the critical density. This is pretty amazing. This figure, taken from <a href=""http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/080998/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, shows the contribution from the different components now (top), and at the time of the CMB emission (380,000 yr after the Big Bang; bottom):</p>

<p>As soon as you reached the Sun itself, you would sink. The sun's density is less than 1 — and 1 is the density of water. So you would be sucked inside kind of. Except that there are convection currents. If we happen to be just above one, we might be kept close to the surface. </p>

<p>But, eventually, the eddies would entrain us sideways until we came to a ""downdraft"" that would take us downwards. </p>

"Shape of neutron stars","2060","","<p>I've heard that the more an object spins, the less of a true sphere it is.
Using this logic most of neutron stars would be far from spherical,in general what shape are most neutron stars?</p>
","<p>I don't think you'll find a single agreed shape for a rotating neutron star, not least because we don't have an agreed single model for the equation of state of the material in a neutron star (which is more complex than the name suggests).</p>

<p>I found one <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3259.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">openly available paper</a> (I'm sure there are more) which will give you a rough flavor for the complexity of modeling the shape of neutron stars.

<p>When I first heard this, I was totally confused. Sun is a star too. The Sun will eventually enter the Red Giant Phase, and then it will eventually become a white-dwarf.</p>

<p>How and why did Chandrasekar express his limit relative to Sun?</p>
","<p>The mass of the sun is just a unit of convenience in a astronomy. The sun's mass and luminosity, in particular, are relatively easy for us to measure precisely, and when we're talking about stars, provide a convenient scale where the numbers won't be too ""astronomical"" (be too high a power of $10$ to picture easily). You could derive the Chandrasekhar limit in grams, kilograms, or slugs from the relevant physics, if you wanted. The relevant equation (<A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit"" rel=""noreferrer"">from the Wikipedia article</A>) is:
$$M_{\mathrm{limit}} = \frac{\omega_3^0 \sqrt{3\pi}}{2} \left(\frac{\hbar c}{G}\right)^{3/2} \frac{1}{(\mu_e m_\mathrm{H})^2},$$
where $\mu_e$ is the average molecular weight per electron (stellar composition dependent), $m_\mathrm{H}$ is the mass of hydrogen, and $\omega_3^0$ is a numerical constant that is approximately $2.018236\ldots$.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the Chandrasekhar limit is a limit on the mass of the final white dwarf, not of the object that will produce the white dwarf.</p>

"How do star densities work?","2013","","<p>If we take a look at stars more massive than the Sun, their densities vary a lot. UY Scuti is an extremely low-density star that's only <strong>8.5x</strong> more massive than the Sun, but is <strong>1000-2000x</strong> its size. r136a1, on the other hand, is <strong>256x</strong> more massive than the Sun, but is only <strong>30x</strong> its size. Neither of them are main-sequence. </p>

<p>The Sun has a lower mass than both of them, yet it's also smaller than both of them.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like mass makes a big difference. Both reach hydrostatic equilibrium at completely different sizes. r136a1 has a much stronger gravitational pull than UY Scuti, but it should also have much more radiation pressure, right?</p>

<p>So how can we determine the density of a star? Is there a formula?</p>
","<p>The mean density of the star is really only defined by the formula $\bar\rho=M/V=3M/4\pi R^3$.  The radius of a star is a generally a very complicated function of a star's other properties.  When we determine the radius in stellar models, it's only because we've solved equations that describe the structure of the whole star, and read off the value at what we define as the surface. So no simple formula in general.</p>

<p>That said, one can derive the approximate functional dependence for stars of various evolutionary states through the principle of <em>homology</em>. i.e. assuming that stars of a certain type are just rescaled versions of each other. Glancing at my old course notes, on the upper main sequence, where stars burn hydrogen principally through the CNO cycle and have radiative envelopes dominated by electron-scattering opacity, we derived $R\propto M^{15/19}$. The same principle (but with different assumptions about the star) is used to determine the location of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayashi_track"">Hayashi track</a> for pre-main-sequence stars, along which $R\propto M^{-7}T^{49}$.  Particular formulae can be found for different types of star but the relationships between $M$ and $R$ vary wildly.</p>

<p>Neither the two stars you mentioned are typical main-sequence stars. R136a1 is a Wolf-Rayet star, which is basically a star that has blasted away most of its hydrogen envelope.  Mass-radius relations are usually strongly dependent on mean molecular weight, which is higher without hydrogen, so the relations break down (or, rather, would have to be derived separately). But usually higher mean molecular weight gives a more compact star. UY Scuti has probably finished burning hydrogen in its core and has moved off the main sequence. So again, it'll follow a different relation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the Earth’s orbital path was elliptical, but its axis was not tilted, the analemma curve would be oval shaped. At the Equator, this line would be a straight line spanning from left to right or West to East.</p>
  
  <p>The 23.5-degree axial tilt of the Earth affects the Sun’s apparent position in the sky – as the year progresses and the Earth continues to spin at an tilted axis and orbit around the Sun, the Sun seems to move up and down (North-South) in the sky. This has the effect of generating the two loops of the figure 8.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You're correct that the tilt of the analemma varies with the latitude. Observers in the Northern hemisphere will obtain an analemma curve with the broader loop at the bottom. This reverses for observers in the Southern hemisphere, where the broader loop is on the top of the curve. At equator, the anlaemma lies on its side. At north pole, only the top of the analemma would be visible, while it is the opposite at the south pole.</p>

"What is Gravitational Lensing?","1981","","<p>What is the effect known as gravitational lensing? How does it work? What objects would be able to cause this effect?</p>
","<p>Gravitational lensing is the bending of light by massive objects in between the observer (us), and a background source of light. It is a direct prediction of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, and was tested and confirmed by Sir Aurther Eddington during the famous <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_May_29,_1919"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Solar exlipse of May 29, 1919</a>, where the apparent position of a star very close to the sun was observed at a <em>different</em> location - the exact position was successfully predicted by GR.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I8GDI.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There are many situations which can give rise to gravitational lensing. These regimes are:</p>

<p><strong>Strong Lensing</strong></p>

<p>Strong lensing is the most visually stunning form of gravitational lensing, and as its name suggests, requires an extremely massive object, and a good deal of alignment between the lens and the source. Galaxy clusters are the most common cause of strong gravitational lensing. Partial arcs, full arcs (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Einstein rings</a>), and multiple images are all strong gravitational lensing features one can observe. Some of the most commonly studied objects producing strong gravitational lensing features are the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Abell_clusters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abell clusters</a>, the most famous of which is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_1689"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abell 1689</a> (image below).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lbIvw.jpg"" alt=""Abell 1689""></p>

<p>Strong lensing features like arcs and rings are typically due to extended objects (like background galaxies which are not part of the cluster itself), and multiple-image (mostly quad-image systems) are typically objects like background quasars. </p>

<p><strong>Weak Lensing</strong></p>

<p>Weak gravitational lensing occurs much more frequently than strong lensing. Lenses can be clusters (in their outer regions), individual galaxies, or even large scale structure in the universe. Weak lensing is not a noticeable effect by eye, rather, it has to be done statistically. Ellipticities of a <em>field</em> of background galaxies are observed on a grid, and are statistically averaged together to create the weak lensing signal. Shape distortions of these background galaxies due to lensing are on the percent scale. One important assumption is made, however, and that is that galaxies' isophotes (lines of constant light) are elliptical, and their orientations are completely random. With that, any <em>net</em> tangential shearing produced is due to gravitational lensing. In the image below (from upper left to bottom right), the upper left frame shows an unlensed field of circular galaxies, and to its immediate right shows the effect of lensing. The image in the bottom right has added shape noise (a 'realistic' field of background galaxies), and to its right is how the field would lens.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jXnUj.png"" alt=""WL Field.""></p>

<p>Lastly, higher order shape distortion effects, most notably <a href=""http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~goldberg/flexion/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flexion</a>, can produce the extended galaxy sources to not only shear, but to flex. This is currently a tough thing to measure.</p>

<p><strong>Microlensing</strong></p>

<p>Microlensing is a regime of lensing which is most common on the scale of the Milky Way galaxy. This can occur when background stars pass behind foreground stars. Microlensing is actually strong enough to produce multiple images of the background star, but since the image separations are so small (micro-arcsecond scale - hence the name), what we observe (since an angular resolution of a micro-arcsecond is tough to achieve)  is a change in the flux as the object moves into and out of alignment with the intermediate massive object. Interestingly, microlensing has actually proven useful in detecting planets around stellar lensing systems.</p>

"Did we ever actually see the earth revolving around the sun? Is the geocentric model completely disproved?","1947","","<p>Did we ever actually see the Earth revolving around the Sun?</p>

<p>Also, is the geocentric model completely disproved or was it sidelined because the heliocentric model made things easier to understand? </p>

<p>(BTW I know Earth revolves around the Sun and am just asking out of curiosity.)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>What you're asking, basically, is whether there are any proofs for the heliocentric model of the Solar System.</p>

<p>A literal naked-eye observation of the Earth revolving around the Sun would be rather difficult, since human beings have never gone to another planet yet, and have only been to the Moon briefly, decades ago.</p>

<p>Here are several proofs; some of them are historically relevant also.</p>

<p><strong>Kepler's laws of planetary motion</strong></p>

<p>This became one of the earliest proofs, as soon as Newton figured out the law of universal gravitation, and the ""fluxions"" (what we would call today differential equations). When you assume a heliocentric model, and the inverse square law for gravity, then Kepler's laws in a heliocentric model come out of the equations naturally, as soon as you do the math.</p>

<p>This is like saying: ""if it's heliocentric, and knowing that the law of gravity is correct, then Kepler's laws should be such-and-such"". And then: ""oh, but the theoretical calculations for Kepler's laws matches the actual observations with great precision. Therefore, our hypothesis (heliocentric, inverse square law) must be correct.""</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pOlgX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It was the earliest strong indication that the heliocentric model is in natural accord with the basic laws of science, whereas the geocentric view was becoming more and more contrived as evidence accumulated.</p>

<p>Tycho Brahe in late 1500s provided the enormous mass of observations of planetary motion. Johannes Kepler in early 1600s used Brahe's observations to come up with his laws empyrically (and also arguing for the heliocentric model). Isaac Newton in late 1600s said ""yes, Kepler is right, because of mathematics and the law of gravity, and here's the proof from calculus"".</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion</a></p>

<p><strong>Stellar parallax</strong></p>

<p>An early argument <em>against</em> heliocentrism was that, if the Earth was really revolving around the Sun, then very distant objects, such as the stars, would appear to be ever-so-slightly bobbing back and forth around their average positions. Since that's not the case, it was argued, therefore the Earth must be fixed.</p>

<p>You can see this argument in historical archives, proposed by theologians in the late 1600s, in favor of the geocentric model, and against the growing consensus then of ""natural philosophers"" (what we would call today scientists) that the heliocentric model was correct.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/91QZA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In reality, parallax does exist, it's just very small. It was measured experimentally in the 1800s, and was then quickly used to determine, for the first time, the distance to the nearest stars.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax</a></p>

<p><strong>Aberration of starlight</strong></p>

<p>The direction where we see a distant star also changes when Earth's speed vector changes during its revolution around the Sun. This is different from parallax; it's more akin to the way raindrops on the side windows of a car leave diagonal traces when the car starts moving (even though the raindrops fall vertically).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CO54M.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It's essentially a relativistic phenomenon (when applied to light), but it can be partially explained in a classic framework. It was actually observed before parallax in the late 1600s (the heyday of Newton), but it went unexplained until early 1700s.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_of_light"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_of_light</a></p>

<p><strong>Orbital mechanics of interplanetary probes</strong></p>

<p>Landing a probe on Mars or Venus would simply not work if you assumed a geocentric model. A geocentric description of the Solar System might remain valid in a purely kinematic perspective (just the geometry of motion) as long as you remain on Earth. But the illusion breaks down quickly as soon as you start to consider dynamics (see Kepler's laws), and/or when you try to actually leave Earth (space probes).</p>

<p>Let me reinforce this point, since several answers and comments got it wrong: the geocentric and the heliocentric models are not completely interchangeable, or a matter of relativity. You could build an ""explanatory"" geocentric model, and it would be ""correct"", purely in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">kinematic</a> fashion (the geometry of motion), and only as seen from Earth. But the model breaks down as soon as you consider <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_dynamics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dynamics</a> (forces and masses); it would also reveal itself as incorrect even from a kinematic perspective as soon as you leave Earth.</p>

<p>This is not just an artifice to simplify calculations. The dynamic calculations are <em>wrong</em> in a geocentric model.</p>

<p>In order to compute the very high precision trajectory of the space vehicle carrying <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_%28rover%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Curiosity rover</a> and successfully place it on Mars, you must operate from a heliocentric perspective. The dynamics are all wrong otherwise. You would not miss the target only a little, in a geocentric approach, you would miss it by <em>a lot</em> - the vehicle would not even go in the general direction of Mars.</p>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>

<p>When observed in a telescope, Venus has phases like the Moon, and also grows and then shrinks in size, synchronized with its phases (it's large as a thin crescent, it's small when it's gibbous). In a geocentric model, the size changes could be explained by an elliptic orbit of Venus around Earth, but the phase changes synchronized with that are harder to explain. Both phenomena become trivial to explain in a heliocentric model.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this does not necessarily prove the heliocentric model, just the fact that Venus is orbiting the <em>Sun</em>, not the <em>Earth</em>. So it's an argument against pure (or strict) geocentrism.</p>

<p>Jupiter, when observed in a telescope, clearly has its own satellites. This was an early blow against a strict geocentric model, which assumed that <em>everything</em> must orbit the Earth. It opened the door to the idea that orbits could be centered on other celestial bodies too, and to the idea that things in orbit around larger objects could have their own smaller satellites (and therefore the Earth could orbit the Sun without losing the Moon).</p>

<hr>

<p>The list could continue (and the full list is <em>very</em> long) but these arguments should suffice. You don't necessarily have to see something with your own eyes in order to know with certainty that it's there. In the case of Earth's revolution around the Sun, it was simply a matter of an overwhelming amount of evidence piling up in favor of it.</p>

<p>Geocentrism simply doesn't make any sense whatsoever in modern science and space exploration.</p>

<p>Why is that black stripe there?</p>
","<p>That photograph is a composite of two images taken with different <strong>exposure times</strong>. </p>

<p>To be correct we'd have to say that the exposure of the two photographs is different, i.e. the outer photo was created by absorbing more light. In this case we can assume that the focal ratio (derived from Hubble's lens aperture) and the luminance of the scene (how much light is travelling in the lens' direction) are identical for both photographs, which leaves only the exposure time as a free variable when it comes to determining <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_%28photography%29"">exposure</a>.</p>

<p>This is necessary because we're photographing objects with very different brightness. For Pluto to show up a relatively short exposure time is required, but its moons reflect much less light and would need a longer exposure time to visible. As long as the sensor is exposed, Pluto would continue to increase in brightness to the point that it becomes washed out. Objects that are significantly brighter become over-exposed resulting in a loss of detail and fidelity, known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_%28photography%29"">blown-out highlights</a> in photography. In our case Pluto would turn into a solid white dot compared to the more detailed picture that is now possible. You can draw a parallel with false color images rendered from infrared: this composite is not what the human eye would see if it was capable of picking up this level of light and detail.</p>

<p>In another Hubble image, NASA explained the reason why composite imaging is used:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a composite image because a single exposure of the stellar background, comet Siding Spring, and Mars would be problematic. Mars actually is 10,000 times brighter than the comet, so it could not be properly exposed to show detail in the Red Planet. The comet and Mars also were moving with respect to each other and could not be imaged simultaneously in one exposure without one of the objects being motion blurred. Hubble had to be programmed to track on the comet and Mars separately in two different observations.</p>
  
  <p><em>Source: <a href=""http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/23oct_marscomet/"">Hubble Sees Comet Next to Mars</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very long exposure times are often necessary since relatively little light is coming our way from distant planets and stars. As the Hubble website explains for its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field"">Deep Fields</a> images: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hubble has made a series of very deep observations taken in very dark parts of the sky. Like using a long exposure on a digital camera, these long exposure shots (up to several weeks) reveal very faint details that are not normally visible in shorter exposures. </p>

<p>Wikipedia summarises a paper by <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9607174"">Robert E. Williams and the HDF team</a>, ""The Hubble Deep Field: Observations, Data Reduction, and Galaxy Photometry"" as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between December 18 and December 28, 1995—during which time Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times—342 images of the target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total exposure times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300 nm), 33.5 hours (450 nm), 30.3 hours (606 nm) and 34.3 hours (814 nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by cosmic rays, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.</p>

"Can you see the starting and the ending of a light beam passing in the distance?","1936","","<p>This question arose to me when I saw a SciFi movie where they shot with laser guns and you clearly could see the dashes of light beams travelling from the shooter to the target. Nonsense of course, reality is much more boring.</p>

<p>But I wondered if you would just need more distance: </p>

<ul>
<li>Given a limited light beam traveling from A to B, where ""limited"" means that there is a start and / or end of the emission source causing that beam.</li>
<li>Given enough distance from us to A, B and the line between them</li>
<li>And add some kind of nebular smoke in between just enough to disperse as much light as needed so we can see it here but not as much to prevent it from reaching B.</li>
</ul>

<p>Couldn't we observe the starting and / or the ending of that light beam, progressing on it's way from A to B, like a jet trail in the sky?</p>

<p>If it is possible, where can this be observed? Or do the laws of physics forbid such a thing?</p>
","<p>Nothing forbids this, and it is actually observed astronomically. You need a very bright source of light: such as a supernova (which isn't a beam, but radiates in all directions) and very large distances. The flash of light can be seen spreading out from supernova in a circle, as it illuminates the dust and gas ejected by the supernova progenitor star in the years before</p>

<p>The effect is known as a light echo. Over time the ""beams"" of light move further out, and so the echo widens, as shown in this series of images (from an Australian telescope so you have to read from the bottom up, 507 days means 507 days after the supernova in 1987.) For scale, 5 arcmin is quite small: The moon is about 30 arcmin. <a href=""http://oldweb.aao.gov.au/images/captions/aat066.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a></p>

"Can a solar flare destroy every electronic item on earth?","1931","","<p>I was reading a book about the sun which suggested that a solar flare can destroy every electronic item on Earth. Is this really true and if so, how would it happen? Could we do anything to to prevent it? </p>
","<p>Here's the how: very energetic charged particles interact with the Earth's magnetic field, and when they do so they emit electromagnetic radiation. If the energy of this radiation was high enough then when it reached wires/conductors at the Earth's surface the opposite effect would take place: ie the EM radiation would result in the flow of charged particles (a current). Such currents, if strong enough, could damage very many electronic and electric devices.</p>

<p>As to the possibility: it seems unlikely that such a high energy event would take place (ie to destroy all/nearly all electronic equipment), but it could be possible. We don't have sufficient data.</p>

"Is there a theoretical limit on telescope's resolution?","1931","","<p>Is there a theoretical limit on what we can see with a telescope of fixed size based on Earth's orbit or the Moon, that is in Earth's region of Solar system outside the Earth's atmosphere?</p>

<p>Why not instead of sending probes to Pluto and Ceres, just invest efforts into building better telescopes, so to photograph the surfaces of these bodies in greater detail? I suspect that all necessary information in fact reacheds Earth's region, it is just matter of sensibility and exposure to fix it, am I right?</p>
","<p>The absolute limit of a telescope resolution is given by diffraction. 
No matter how perfectly built and aligned is a telescope, you cannot resolve angles smaller than
$$\theta \propto \frac{\lambda}{D}$$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of interest and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope. This is why a number of millimeters and radio telescope (and also some -antennas) are huge.</p>

<p>The first figure <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> shows the basic principle. Imagine that you can divide what you observe in tiny squares and consider each one as a point like source. Each one will generate a diffraction pattern when passing into the telescope and if two points are too near, you cannot distinguish between them.</p>

<p>Wisely you put your telescope in space: turbulence in the atmosphere degrade the signal, and the best/biggest telescopes have hard times to go below $0.5 arc seconds$  </p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_interferometer"" rel=""nofollow"">Interferometry</a> comes to the rescue increasing $D$ from the telescope size to the distance of two (or more) telescopes (called baseline). Interferometry has been used in radio astronomy since decades. 
From what I hear optical interferometry is much much more complicated and as far as I know the only large scale attempt is the <a href=""http://www.eso.org/paranal/telescopes/vlti/"" rel=""nofollow"">VLTI project</a>.</p>

<p>So you could imagine to have a constellation of relatively small telescopes spread over hundred thousands or millions of kilometers. But this have the huge problem that you have to know the position and timing of every one of them with an impressive precision (my guess is that the precision in position is of the order of $\lambda$).</p>

<hr>

<p>The other problem is light collection. If you want to see something very faint you have two options: 1)you observe for a lot of time or 2) you build a bigger telescope (<a href=""http://jwst.nasa.gov/facts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">6</a> to <a href=""http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/eelt/"" rel=""nofollow"">40</a> meters in diameter). 
And here also the largest baseline interferometers cannot do much, as the amount of light that they collect is just the sum of the light collected by the single telescopes. </p>

<hr>

<p>To conclude: to observe Pluto or Ceres with high enough accuracy you would need a large number of large space telescopes very far away one from the other with perfect telemetry. It's far easier and cheaper to got there to take pictures.  </p>

"Why does the darkening of the Moon go from left-to-right during an eclipse?","1929","","<p>In anticipation of the upcoming <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2014_lunar_eclipse"">April 2014 lunar eclipse</a>, I decided to use the 3D virtual planetarium software <a href=""http://www.stellarium.org/"">Stellarium</a> to simulate what it is supposed look like where I live, since I've never actually witnessed an actual eclipse before. I set the clock to begin at the moonrise before the beginning of the event and to tick at a rate of a few virtual-minutes per real-second, pressed play, and waited for the eclipse to begin. When it did, I saw something I did not expect. To be honest, I realized my expectations were embarrassingly naïve.</p>

<p>I watched the Moon rise in the east and begin its upward left-to-right path across the night sky, towards its zenith in the south. My expectation was that the moment the Moon enters Earth's shadow which marks the beginning of the eclipse would be visually apparent by the darkening of the full moon's outer limb on the right side, and the darkening would progress from right to left from there. When I saw that the darkening actually progresses in the opposite direction, I immediately realized that my understanding of the geometry and kinematics of the Earth-Moon-Sun system must be much shallower than I would have thought.</p>

<p>My main question is must lunar eclipses happen this way every time, and if so why? My gut is now telling me that it does, so I'm mostly interested in an answer of reasonable depth to the 'why' part of the question.</p>

<p>Additionally, it occurs to me that the observation of left-to-right progression of darkening of the Moon's face during a lunar eclipse is especially counter-intuitive from the point of views of ancient geocentric cosmologies based on a stationary Earth that doesn't rotate. Can this observation be taken as empirical evidence that the Earth rotates? (I could be completely off base here. If so, please correct me.)</p>
","<p>On any given day, you see the moon rise in the east and (apparently) travel across the sky from your left to the right; therefore, you would assume (incorrectly) that the leading edge of the moon's movement must be to the right. </p>

<p>That is not correct.</p>

<p>The apparent motion you are seeing is predominantly from the <em>Earth's</em> ~24 hour rotation. <strong>But the orbit of the moon is ACTUALLY from <em>west to east</em></strong> as it revolves around the Earth every 29.5 days. Look a the diagram below.</p>

<p>If you were looking down at the earth-moon-sun system far above the ecliptic over the north pole, you would see the Earth spinning in a counter-clockwise direction… and the moon is also revolving around the Earth in a counter-clockwise direction.  </p>

<p>So forget about the Earth's rotation for a moment; it has nothing to do with the moon passing into the Earth's shadow (i.e. the eclipse.) Look at the diagram below, and place yourself on that little ball labeled ""Earth"" and look into the night sky. Which side of the moon is covered first as it passes behind the shadow cast by the Earth? What do you see?</p>

","<p>Nothing ""escapes"" a BH - in the sense that a signal originating inside the event horizon remains forever inside. If something is observed moving away from the BH, then it was generated outside the event horizon. If it was generated inside, it would never be observed at all, forever and ever.</p>

<p>Gravity itself does not ""escape"" a BH - and neither does ""not escape"". Gravity is simply a characteristic of the metric of spacetime. If spacetime is warped in a certain way, gravity can be measured to exist. A BH is simply a very powerful distortion of spacetime, nothing more, nothing less. It is generated by a concentration of mass/energy, which warps spacetime, and then that concentration becomes trapped by this distortion that it has produced.</p>

<p>In that sense, gravity is simply part of the BH, because gravity is spacetime being warped, and because a BH is essentially just that - warped spacetime. A BH's gravitational field is part of the BH itself, extending to infinity (but getting weaker with distance). It doesn't ""escape"" because there's nothing there in the process of escaping.</p>

<p>It's like having a plastic bag tied into a knot to keep water inside, and someone asks ""so how does the plastic escape the knot?"" The plastic does not ""escape"" the knot, the knot is part of the plastic.</p>

<p>This all becomes easier to understand when you realize that gravity is not a thing, it's just an effect of spacetime being distorted.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: I think what you were really asking was - can a BH have its own magnetic field? The answer is yes.</p>

<p>A BH can have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hair_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3 characteristics: mass, spin (rotation), and electric charge (a.k.a. the no-hair theorem)</a>. All other characteristics of the matter falling in it are lost, except these three. If you drop a proton into a neutral BH, then the BH acquires a charge equal to one proton, and that's a measurable electric field.</p>

<p>Now consider a spinning BH with an electric charge, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr%E2%80%93Newman_metric"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Kerr-Newman metric</a>. You have a charge, and you have spin. That means you have magnetism. So, yes, a BH can have a magnetic dipole. However, the rotation axis and the magnetic dipole axis must be aligned - a BH cannot be seen as ""pulsing"". Again, no signal from inside the event horizon can be observed outside.</p>

<p>However, you should not imagine the electric (or magnetic, same thing) field as ""escaping"" the BH. It does not escape. What happens is, when the charges were swallowed by the BH, the lines of electric field remain ""glued"" to the BH, which then acquires a charge. Those lines of electric field have existed forever, they don't ""escape"" anything, and continue to exist after the charge is trapped by the BH.</p>

<p>Note: electric fields and magnetic fields are one and the same. One could appear to be the other, depending on the motion of the observer.</p>

"Do all neutron stars spin?","1892","","<p>I know that some of them are pulsars and pulsars spin very fast, but do all of the neutron stars spin? I would think that they would because of conservation of momentum, but I'm really just not sure.</p>
","<p>I think it is absolutely safe to say that all neutron stars spin.</p>

<p>Conservation of angular momentum ensures that as they collapse from a massive stellar core the size (roughly) of the Earth, to something with a 10km radius, their angular velocity increases roughly as the square of the decrease in their radius (i.e. a factor of $\sim 4\times 10^5$. Thus, even if the stellar core had the slightest spin to begin with, then the neutron star will be spinning very fast indeed.</p>

<p>Young pulsars appears to be born with rotation periods that vary from about 0.01 s to perhaps a second or so. They then lose angular momentum as they get older.</p>

<p>The difficulty in answering your question without any equivocation is that once neutron stars spin down to periods of longer than 1-10 seconds or so (depending on the pulsar magnetic field strength - see picture below from <a href=""http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2011/02/aa15190-10/aa15190-10.html"">Wang et al. 2011</a>) then the pulsar mechanism switches off and the neutron star, to all intents and purposes, becomes invisible (the so-called ""pulsar deathline"", <a href=""http://zmtt.bao.ac.cn/xian/proceedings/ZhangB/fin/ZhangB.pdf"">Zhang 2003</a>) .</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KHef.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KHef.jpg"" alt=""Pulsar period distribution""></a></p>

<p>It is expected that the spin down will continue, even after the pulsar has switched off, but the spin down rate itself depends on the rotation speed, so the neutron star will never come to a halt, even after tens of billions of years.</p>

<p>Here is the photo's caption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Star trails beyond the Gemini Observatory on Mauna Kea, from which a laser beam forms a guide star on the Earth's ionosphere that enables the use of adaptive optics. In this long exposure, the laser beam tracks across the sky, making the visible arc. (The object in the sky at which the laser was pointed changed several times during the night.) Note that stars rise and set at an angle (not perpendicular) relative to the horizon, because Hawaii is about 20 degrees north of Earth's equator. Also, the farther a star is from the pole, the more its path looks straight, over a short distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read <a href=""https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081024132334AAP642v"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the answer to this question about how to measure star trail angles</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only star trail angles I'm familiar with deal with astrophotography.
  You set up a camera, put the film in, open the shutter for a time exposure of the stars. As the stars appear to revolve around the earth, they make ""arcs"" on the film.</p>
  
  <p>To calculate the angle of the arc, use the formula: 1 minute of time = 15 minutes of arc. If the answer is over 60, divide by 60 to get degrees of arc. So: 12 minute exposure = 180 minutes of arc or 3˚ of arc length for your star trail. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure how to approach this problem since the answer uses time to calculate the angle of the arc, but no time is given here.</p>
","<p>The answer <em>is</em> given here. One minute of time corresponds to 15 arcminutes (written as 15'). This is because in 24 h the Earth revolves 360º, so
$$\textrm{angle per time} = \frac{360º}{24 \textrm{ h}} =\frac{21,600'}{1440 \textrm{ min}} = 15'/\textrm{min}.$$
If you turn this fraction upside down, you see that 1' corresponds to 1/15 min, or 4 seconds.</p>

<p>That is, you measure the angle (let's call it $\theta$) of any of the star traces, as seen from the center (notice that the Northern Star is not exactly at the center, so that it itself traces a tiny arc instead of a dot). From the picture below, I get roughly $\theta = 135º$. The exposure time is thus:
$$t_\mathrm{exp} = \frac{\theta}{\textrm{angle per time}} = \frac{135º}{360º/24 \textrm{ h}} \sim 9\textrm{ h}.$$</p>

<p>By the way, if you mark the position of the ends of the trails, you can recover the stellar sky. I found Ursa Major, marked by the yellow dots.</p>

<p>I am able to focus from way out so I can see the 'blind spot' of the secondary mirror, go through 'focused' and then continue moving the mirror in the same direction until I again see the blind spot.  So I know I'm focusing through when it should be 'good'.  But, like I said, what I see is a relatively unfocused spot of light that is clearer and steadier with my naked eye.</p>

<p>Admittedly, my 'seeing conditions' aren't very good since I am looking through my window in a suburban neighborhood where light pollution is pretty bad.  That being said, I still see Mars and Sirius quite brightly - it's just that they never come into clear focus - nor are they any larger than when I look using my eyes.  And when I move my eye around the eyepiece I see streaks of light in different directions originating from the target.</p>

$$T(R)=\left[\frac{3GM \dot{M}}{8 \pi \sigma R^3} \left(1-\sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{inner}}}{R}} \right) \right]^{\frac{1}{4}}$$
where <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant"" rel=""nofollow"">$G$</a>, $\pi$, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_constant"" rel=""nofollow"">$\sigma$</a> are the familiar constants, $M$ is the mass of the central body (and $\dot{M}$ is the rate of accretion onto the body), and $R_{\text{inner}}$ is the inner radius of the disk - possibly (if the object is a black hole) the Schwarzschild radius $R_s$, in which case we can simplify this a little more. So the temperature in the accretion disk is far from constant.</p>

<p>Whether or not there is plasma depends on the exact nature of the disk, the central object and the region around it. For example, a supermassive black hole may have different matter in its disk than that of a stellar-mass black hole. I should think, though, that black holes in binary systems accreting mass from a companion should have plasma in their accretion disks, and supermassive black holes might also have plasma from nearby stars.</p>

</ul>

<p>I would like to know the time the traveler experiences, and the time that everyone else (e.g. those on earth) experience.</p>
","<p>Jonathan's answer is essentially correct, but as Rob Jeffries comments, he doesn't take into account that the Universe is expanding during the journey.</p>

<p>The edge of the observable Universe is 47 billion lightyears (Gly) away. Even if you are a lightbeam, you cannot reach that point. The farthest you can go if departing today is roughly 5 Gpc, or 17 Gly, but this journey would of course take infinitly long (or else it wouldn't be ""the farthest you can go""). This distance is probably what the linked article is referring to (I didn't read the article; it's very, very long).</p>

<p>So, in order for the answer to be any fun, you have to freeze the Universe, using magic, which is what Jonathan's calculator is doing. Here I'll just provide the analytical solution: In that case, the <em>proper</em> time $\tau$ (i.e. the time experienced by the traveler) to reach a distance $x$ when traveling at a constant acceleration $a$ is
$$
\tau = \frac{c}{a} \cosh^{-1} \left( \frac{ax}{c^2} +1 \right),
$$
where $c$ is the speed of light. If you wish to decelerate after having reached halfway, you just divide $x$ by $2$ and multiply the result by $2$.</p>

<p>If you plug in the $x=15\,\mathrm{Gly}$ you request, you get roughly <strong>45 years</strong>. To get to the edge of the Universe at 47 Gly actually only takes a few years more. The reason for this is simply that traveling at 1G gets you to (almost) the speed of light in only a couple of years, and hence you experience (almost) no time, no matter how far you go.</p>

<p>The time experienced for the Earthlings for the traveler at constant acceleration is given by
$$
t(\tau) = \frac{c}{a} \sinh \left( \frac{a \tau}{c} \right),
$$
which works out to 15 Gyr for the 15 Gly, and 47 Gyr for the observable Universe. The reason is simply that the traveler, from the point of view of the Earthlings, extremely fast reaches a speed which is almost the speed of light.</p>

"Could the 9th planet be virtual?","1841","","<p>Astronomers recently claim that there is evidence for a 9th planet. As far as I understood it, this is mainly based on coinciding orbital parameters of a few Kuiper belt objects.</p>

<p>Apart from the question, if this was a possible or likely scenario, how could we distinguish a ""real"" 9th planet from a virtual one, except by the obvious answer if we can observe it directly?</p>

<p><em>Forgive me, if this is a stupid or trivial question or if this was answered before. I am not a professional astronomer, yet I have a physics/engineering background. I did a quick internet search to answer this question but I simply may have used the wrong terms or sources.</em></p>
","<p>The ninth planet can absolutely be a ""virtual"", in the way you describe it, meaning observed data indicating the gravitational influence by an object is not actually caused by such an object.</p>

<p>A simple visualisation of this is the case of a two-body system, where we observe two objects orbiting a common barycentre. From the observed data, one can get the impression that there is an object in the barycentre, pulling both of your observed objects against it.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>However, a barycentric way to explain the observations gets less likely as you add more bodies. Be aware that the current indications of ""planet 9"" is based on a mere correlation of some not-so-accurate data, from a small sample size, heavily biased by observation constraints.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As a rule of thumb, incomplete and inaccurate data <strong>always</strong> imply the risk of causing virtual objects.</p>

<p>It should also be noted too that observations in the Kuiper belt generally can not yield how a orbit changes, due to the extremely long revolution times. observing ""Interactions"" are actually mostly about tracing an orbit back from its current state vectors, to find probable interaction events in the past. That is literary to <em>ask</em> for data artefacts and virtual objects.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Before anyone objects about how easy it is to falsify that: <em>Yes</em> it is easy to determine that there can not actually be an object there, based purely on observing the two bodies. <strong>But</strong>, that requires 1. accurate data about the motion of the two objects, and 2. their mass.

"What would be the dynamics of a double-planet system, similar to Earth / Moon, but with both bodies nearly Earth-sized?","1836","","<p>Researching a sci-fi story involving a ""twin-planet"" system. Is such an arrangement (however unlikely) physically possible? And if so, must they be tidally locked with each other, similar to the moon, month-long days, etc?  </p>
","<p>This is a duplicated question but I think it fits better into astronomy than into physics. I'll try to answer all aspects of this question including the consequences.</p>

<p>First, is it possible? Like already pointed out it is, like Pluto and Charon. But is is it possible for bigger planets, with the size of Earth. Well we didn't find this planet system jet, but the universe is big. There is no physical law that would forbid this system, it mid be unlikely and very rare but it would be possible.</p>

<p>Let's assume somewhere is a plante system with two Earth-sized twins. What would be the dynamics of this systems on the consequences for possible living beings on one of this planets.</p>

<p>One consequence is that the gravity center of this system would be between both planets, if they exactly are the same size (same mass) the gravity center would be in the exact middle of both. That means both planets are rotating around this point (while they rotating around a sun). This would lead to some effects like in a centrifuge and lead to some weird appearances. The gravity point of our Earth – Moon system is already shifted from the geometrical center point of our earth. And this leads into tides. The tides on our double Earth system would be vast (assuming at least one of this planets is just like our earth and has water on it). Complete areas would be periodically covered with water. Most living beings would probably be amphibians. This of course means the planet would rotate. In the beginning the planets would rotated but they would slow each other down until they show the same side to each other. Just like our earth did to the Moon. The Moon continually slows down the rotation of our Earth, but with his minor mass this takes a while. This processes would be much quicker on the double earth system. But even this would take some time. So it would be a matter of time when you look at this system. If it's an young system they would still rotated if it's an older system they would show the same side each other.</p>

<p>The last point would fix the tides problem, because the water level would be stationary. But this would lead into new problems. The day length would be as long as they need to rotated around their common gravity center. I'll be honest. I am not sure how long this would be. For a stable double Earth system the distance between both planets would be further then the earth-moon distance. Let's just assume a day in that system would take 2 Earth months for simplification. This would mean on daylight it would be very hot and at night it would be very cold. One side of the planet would be heat up for hundreds of hours (our earth hours) and the other half would cool down for the same time. Temperatures over a period would jump up and down in big steps. There is no living being known on earth that can handle both extreme hot and extreme cold in such a short period of time. Also this would lead into very heavy and constant storms in the area where the sun sets or rises, making living there even harder.</p>

<p>Also your weight (stepping on the bath scale) would vary depend on where on the planet you are. If you on the side facing the other planet you would be heavier than on the other side of the planet. 
An other point that would be possible, but I will point out I am not completely sure about this. The planets would struggle keeping their atmosphere for a long period of time because of the rotation. The side facing away from each other would have thicker atmosphere than on the sides (see my sketch). </p>

<p>At this point the gravity pull of the planet is also lower then everywhere else. This could help the molecules to escape the earth, in a long period of time.</p>

<p>I realize both of these numbers are not strictly defined, but still, we can use our best observations together with our best guesses to find out which number is larger, and by how many magnitudes.

<p>What is your answer or guesstimate?</p>
","<h3>Number of stars in the observable universe</h3>

<p>There are about 100 to 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe. Galaxies range in size from a few billion to hundreds of trillions stars.

(After getting this result, I found multiple sources that give answers ranging from 10<sup>21</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup> stars in the universe.)</p>

<h3>Number of words ever spoken</h3>

<p>We're talkative, but we also sleep and eat and listen. Assuming we talk for the equivalent of 3 hours per day and we speak at about 150 words per minute, or about 10 million words per year. I recall 100 billion as being a rough estimate of the number of modern humans who have ever lived. Many of those people died during or shortly after  childbirth. Assuming an average life expectancy at birth of 25 years (generous), that means humans have spoken 2.5×10<sup>19</sup> words since we first gained the gift of gab.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>What is the reason for this difference between assumed and actual path variation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even your second image isn't correct. Imagine zooming in on a small portion of the Moon's orbit about the Sun, for example, one full moon to the next, with the Sun zoomed out of the picture. Now imagine drawing a line segment from one outer cusp (full moon) to the next. In both of your images, that line segment crosses outside of the curve. In other words, both of your curves are concave.</p>

<p>Compare that to the he Moon's orbit about the Sun. This is a convex curve. If you pick any two points on that curve and draw a line segment between them, the entirety of that segment will be on or inside the curve. The reason the Moon's orbit about the Sun is convex is because the gravitational force exerted by the Sun on the Moon is more than twice than exerted by the Earth on the Moon. The orbit would be concave if the Moon was closer to the Earth than 259000 km (about 40.6 Earth radii). Since the Moon orbits at about 385000 km (about 60.4 Earth radii), the Moon's orbit about the Sun is convex.</p>

<p>Whether the orbit of a moon about the Sun is non-simple (first image in the question), simple/concave (second image in the question), or simple/convex (Moon's orbit about the Sun), the deviations from an ellipse are tiny. With regard to the Earth-Moon system, the deviations are so very small that at the plotted resolution (288x288 pixels), the orbits of the Earth, the Earth-Moon barycenter, and the Moon about the Sun will be right on top of one another. The reason the variations are so small (less than one pixel at 288x288 pixels) is because of the huge ratio of the size of Earth/Moon orbit about the Sun compared to the size of the Moon's orbit about the Earth.</p>

<p>Those backward loops in your first image don't happen for any object orbiting the Earth. That would require an orbital velocity about the Earth greater than the Earth's orbital velocity about the Sun. The Earth's orbital velocity about the Sun is about 30 km/sec, considerably more than the orbital velocity of an object in low Earth orbit is about 7.8 km/sec.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Has this path been like this since the formation of the Moon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The Moon formed at four to six Earth radii, far less than the 40.6 Earth radii figure cited above. The Moon's orbit initially looked like your second image.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do Natural Satellites of other planets also follow the same orbit around the Sun?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The massive planets are much further from the Sun than is the Earth and are much more massive than is the Earth. The orbits of most of the moons of Jupiter about the Sun are concave rather than convex. Only the outermost moons of Jupiter have convex orbits about the Sun. A few of Jupiter's innermost moons (Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, Thebe, Io, and Europa) exhibit the retrograde motion depicted in your first image.</p>

<p>With regard to moons whose orbit about the Sun is convex, the distances that correspond to the 259000 km value for the Earth are 129000 km for Mars, 24.1 million kilometers for Jupiter, 24.2 million kilometers for Saturn, 19.0 million kilometers for Uranus, and 32.3 million kilometers for Neptune. Both of Mars' moons orbit close-in. However, all four of the giant planets have moons whose semi-major axis orbit fall outside the corresponding limit.</p>

","<p>If by ""a hollow object"" you mean a spherical shell -- a theoretically perfect sphere Moon, with a perfect sphere of material removed from the center: The center of mass, and therefore the center of gravity remains at the geometric center.

<p>The body of the moon is plastic; Meaning the gravitational forces are strong enough to reshape the material... it basically flows into a sphere. So if you magically removed a small amount of the center, it would collapse into a smaller sphere. If you removed most of the center, then the ""thin"" shell may or may not be strong enough to support it's shape.</p>

<p>Inside a hollow spherical shell, there is no net gravitational force. So you would be in a zero-G environment everywhere within the shell. From outside the shell, the gravity is the same as if all the remaining mass was located at a point at the geometric center.</p>

"Why are all space observatories in Chile?","1760","","<p>Anytime I hear about astronomy there is observatory in Chile involved. Sounds like there are the best conditions to watch space. Anyone care to explain what is the reason? </p>
","<p>[disclaimer: I am also not a true observer, but I have visited observatories before, and I do amateur observations regularly]</p>

<p>Definitely not all observatories are in Chile. Chile, however (the Atacama desert in particular) is an excellent location for an astronomical observatory. The Atacama desert has one of the darkest night skies on Earth, which is excellent for astronomical observations.</p>

<p>As Warrick mentioned, the ideal observatory is located at the highest possible altitude, such that there is as little air as possible between the telescope and the stars. Something else to consider, though, is that if the telescope should be manned by humans permanently it cannot be located too high due both to the difficulty for humans to function at extremely high altitudes and the price tag of getting the telescope parts up there. The two observatories in the Atacame desert of Chile are both located at an altitude of 2.5 km, which is definitely not the highest point on earth (the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Loa_Observatory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Mauna Loa"">Mauna Loa</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea_Observatories"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Mauna Kea"">Mauna Kea</a> observatories mentioned by Warrick are both located at higher altitudes).</p>

<p>Another requirement is that the location should be as cold as possible. This is not to torture the poor observers operating the telescope, but because warm air tends to be more turbulent. More turbulence in the air means less precise observations. However, as temperature tends to decrease with increasing altitude, this is usually automatically satisfied. Having a stable temperature also helps. If the telescope heats up during the day, the temperature of the air inside will differ from that of the surrounding air at night. Since the refractive index of air depends (although very slightly) on temperature, this will cause further deviation of light rays from their ideal straight paths, leading to less accurate measurements. For this reason professional telescopes usually contain some kind of temperature regulation.</p>

<p>A combination of the above reasons is why observatories are in the locations they are. Theoretically, the best observatory location has been found to be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_A"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ridge A</a> on Antarctica. The reason you always hear about Chile is not its location. There are other locations that are at least as well suited as the Atacama desert for astronomical observations.</p>

<p>The most important reason you always hear about Chile is probably that it is home to the VLT, or Very Large Telescope, which is the most productive ground-based telescope in the optical region (according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Telescope"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Wikipedia"">Wikipedia</a>). It uses interferometry combining the observations from four individual telescopes. This makes the combined effective aperture of the VLT the biggest in the world. As both the most productive telescope and the telescope with the largest effective aperture it produces a lot of results, and those results are quite likely to be important enough to appear in popular science articles.</p>

<p>However Chile is definitely not the only possible location for observatories. Apart from Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roque_de_los_Muchachos_Observatory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Observatory del Roque de los Muchachos</a> on La Palma is the first example that pops up in my mind.

","<p>You must have misheard it, or the documentary you watched wasn't presenting very precise information. It does set but it also stays on the night sky for several days during the polar winter (polar night) when the Moon if full. This is relatively simple to imagine, so I'll describe it;</p>

<p>So what's happening is that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Earth's axial tilt</a> during the polar winters leans the whole Northern hemisphere towards the <em>night side</em>, away from the Sun. This tilt is big enough (~ 23.4°) that the night sky objects aligned with the Earth's equatorial plane stay visible relatively low on the horizon. With those regions being either relatively flat and/or with a view towards the sea, there's not many obstructions limiting the viewing angle, so the Moon (and analogous also the Sun during polar summers) stays ""locked"" low above the horizon. To help a bit with imagining this, here's an animation of the Earth's axial tilt, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Globespin-tilt-23.4.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">courtesy of Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pJA82.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If we imagine this animation of the Earth with the Sun in the distant left of the image, so during Northern hemisphere's winter (winter solstice to be precise), and the Moon to the distant right of the image (roughly 25 widths of the image away), so when it's either full or close to this lunar phase, it's not too difficult to appreciate that the northernmost polar regions have a direct line of sight of the Moon during Earth's full rotation on its axis, or a day. If you keep in mind that other celestials, including the Moon, are oblivious to the Earth's axial tilt (well, not exactly, but let's not nitpick about tidal effects that might take millions of years to make a difference), as the Moon moves farther in its orbit, in our case towards the viewer, this observation angle decreases further still and those northernmost latitudes hide to us for some part of the day. At lunar last quarter, it would be directly towards us relative to the image, so this direct line of sight relationship between the Earth and the Moon becomes reciprocal to how we're seeing places on the Earth on the animation.</p>

<p>Why when the Moon is full? Simply because that's when the Moon is also <em>behind the Earth</em> (but not in its shadow), so the relative angle between the observation point and the Moon would stay high enough to observe it. As it moves in lunar phase and in orbit around the Earth farther, this angle becomes lower and the Moon indeed does set also in the arctic region. For what is worth, this goes exactly the same for South pole, only with a half a year difference.</p>

<p>One other effect that plays a role here is the Earth's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">atmospheric refraction</a> which also adds to the duration during which the Moon appears not to set. Meaning, that even when the Moon wouldn't be in direct line of sight, but only marginally so, it would still appear low on the skies due to optical effect (displacement) of the atmosphere. This effect would somewhat offset observing the Moon from lowlands with possibly shallower observation angle when compared to higher altitude observation points with less direct line of sight obstructions, due to denser atmosphere and thus higher refraction index.</p>

<p>The universe is roughly a 4-dimensional spacetime with the big bang as a singularity. It has no edges in the 3d space when travelling. When looking to the past the border, if you like to call it like this, is the big bang. The big bang looks to us on Earth like being in a distance of 13.81 billion (13.81e9) light years in any direction. Or being 13.81 billion years in the past as light needed that time to travel to us. But we cannot travel to that boundary, because the universe expands faster than we (or light) can travel. We had to travel into the past or faster than light to get there, no matter in which spacial direction.</p>

<p>There is no black hole in the center of the universe, but the big bang, if you like to call it the center of a 4-d spacetime.</p>

<p>The universe, when looking to a fixed age of say 13.81 billion years is filled almost homogeneously with galaxies on the very large scale. Locally galaxies are grouped to clusters and superclusters. Superclusters form kind of a 3d-net. But there aren't totally void regions. There is always some gas or some dust or some plasma or some fast-travelling cosmic rays, neutrinos, etc.</p>

<p>If you could stop the expansion of the universe at a given <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_time"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cosmic time</a>, you would see yourself in either direction in approximately the same distance, and in approximately the same past. (Such a structure is called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3-sphere</a>. The surface of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-ball"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">4-ball</a> is an example of a 3-sphere. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqfwPQvb7KA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This youtube video</a> tries to visualize a rotating 3-sphere.)</p>

<p>Due to the fast expansion of spacetime, light cannot travel fast enough around the universe to make this possible. Therefore we can at best look back to the big bang, no matter which direction we look. The light needs more time to travel around the universe as the universe is existing after the big bang.</p>

"How can the universe be infinite?","1730","","<p>I've heard from renowned astrophysicists that we don't yet know whether or not the Universe is infinite. How is that possible regarding the big bang theory is accepted (as they all do)? Are they referring to the existence of other Universes when they say it could be infinite, or what?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What I mean is, even if it is capable of expanding, if everything originated at the big bang how can that space turn to be infinite in a finite time - the age of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the standard <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model"" rel=""noreferrer"">ΛCDM model</a> of the Big Bang, the universe is infinite and has <em>always</em> been such. The Big Bang singularity happened <em>everywhere</em>, in the sense that far back enough in time, the density diverges to infinity at every place.</p>

<p>But this is just a particular model--it assumes that the universe if spatially flat and is globally homogeneous and isotropic. There are extended models in which it is not exactly flat, and so could be finite even if it is still homogeneous and isotropic (if the curvature is even slightly positive). And of course we don't actually <em>know</em> whether it is homogeneous and isotropic at scales much larger than we actually see. Some inflationary models imply that it isn't.</p>

<hr>

<p>To clarify: the ΛCDM model uses the assumes a spatially flat <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric"" rel=""noreferrer"">FLRW solution</a> of general relativity, in which space is the Euclidean $3$-space The Euclidean $3$-space is the only <em>flat</em> homogeneous and isotropic $3$-manifold, so there no way to make it finite without violating at least one of those modeling assumption (e.g., a flat torus could have the same form for the metric, but would not be globally isotropic).</p>

","<p><a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/18847/life-of-the-sun/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Sun will not become a supernova</a>, it will never explode. A star must have about 8 times more mass than the Sun in order to cause a supernova explosion. When it starts to fuse helium, the Sun will become a red giant and expand out to about Earth's orbit and throw out gas to form a beautiful so called planetary nebula. Mercury, Venus and maybe Earth will be inside of its photosphere when it is at the largest. I don't know if they will evaporate completely inside the thin hot gas of the red giant Sun.</p>

<p>The remaining planets will keep orbiting the white dwarf remnant, which is not a star (no fusion) but a compact planet sized object. It will shine like a star because of its stored heat. Orbits will change because the Sun will have only 40% of its mass left, the rest having been thrown out to form a nebula, over very long time. Orbits should become larger, and planets maybe will be pushed out a bit by the ejections from the red giant too. Gas planets maybe get their atmospheres a bit stripped off, icy dwarf planets like Ceres and Pluto could melt and evaporate a bit of their mass since the helium burning red giant is hotter than the Sun today. But I'm kind of guessing here, I don't know if those are significant effects.</p>

","<p>The heliocentric velocity $V_\mathrm{H}$ of an object is its velocity wrt. the Sun. When you measure an object's velocity, you measure it in the reference frame of Earth, which revolves around the Sun with ~30 km/s (varying a bit from aphelion to perihelion), so convert to $V_\mathrm{H}$ you need to know the time of the year of the observation (unless the line of sight toward your object is exactly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane), as well as the angle between the line of sight, and the line of sight toward the Sun. This involves a number of sines and cosines that you can find in e.g. <a href=""https://books.google.dk/books?id=JhU6V1yDRCgC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=geocentric%20to%20heliocentric%20velocity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NBLRwDXsOW&amp;sig=NyR5Kz4lechA7DqrWrnFaBRsydY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwADgKahUKEwiw8PiOlPLIAhVLcRQKHVtsAkE#v=onepage&amp;q=geocentric%20to%20heliocentric%20velocity&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">Barbieri (2006)</a>.</p>

<p>If you further want to convert from $V_\mathrm{H}$ to the reference frame in which the Milky Way's center is at rest, the Local Group is at rest, or the Cosmic Microwave Background is isotropic (the ""cosmic"" frame), <em>then</em> you use the formula you link to, adding a similar term as described above, but instead using the velocity (i.e. speed and direction) of the Sun wrt. to the given frame.</p>

"Do we know the exact spot where big bang took place?","1711","","<p>If you rewind the universe back 14,7 billion years, all matter were in one spot, and then started expanding. Do we know where this is in reference to our own solar system? And is there anything there? Or are all matter in the universe just blown inn all different directions and none is left at the ""original"" spot where it originated</p>
","<p>You're envisioning the Big Bang as a cosmological ""explosion"" in space where the universe is the resulting material expanding in outward all directions. </p>

<p>The problem is, the universe doesn't work like that. </p>

<p>The universe isn't a region of space that is expanding outward into another <em>thing</em> where you can (even hypothetically) fly out to the border and say, ""Yup, that's about all there is. <strong>Let's use these borders to find the center of this expanding sphere.</strong>""</p>

<p>The Universe is literally everything there is: space, time, and everything it contains and ever will contain. And the word <em>contains</em> is even a bit of a misnomer in that it suggests a <em>container</em> with boundaries. But the universe is simultaneously both unbounded and finite at the same time. ""Finite"" refers to the fixed amount of <em>stuff</em> this universe contains (matter, energy, etc)&hellip; and <em>unbounded</em> because this thing we know as ""the universe"" has no borders in a sense that we point to or even experience. So how would you even <em>define</em> a ""center""? There isn't one.</p>

<p>There's a famous way to help visualize an expanding universe that is both finite and unbounded without a center or borders; it's called <strong>""The Balloon Analogy.""</strong> Imagine our friends in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland"" rel=""nofollow"">Flatland</a> living in two-dimensional space&hellip; where everything they know (their entire universe) exists on the surface of a balloon. If you start to inflate that balloon (the expanding universe),  all the little astronomers on the surface will observe that all the surrounding galaxies are moving away from them &mdash; and the farther away those galaxies are, the faster they seem to be moving away. </p>

<p>That's pretty much what most cosmologists believe is happening to us. </p>

<p>Going back to that balloon analogy, picture yourself existing on the surface of that balloon-universe and ask these questions again &mdash; In my expanding universe (the surface of the balloon), where is it's center? Everything is expanding outward in all directions, so if we rewind back in time, certainly everything should converge <em>somewhere,</em> right? Can we just find the borders of this outward expansion and calculate the exact center? So basdically&hellip; <em>""Do we know the exact spot where big bang took place?""</em></p>

<p>Be careful taking the balloon analogy too far, because it starts to break down in many ways. But the answer to where the expansion of the universe emanates <em>from</em> really <strong><em>is</em></strong> that it emanates from everywhere; everything we know is contained within the origin of our own existence, and there <em>is</em> no center and there are no borders by any definition of existence that we can experience.</p>

"Can a natural satellite exist in a geostationary orbit?","1703","","<p>While browsing through Physics SE, I noticed a question about satellites in geostationary orbit (unrelated to the one I'm asking here), and for a moment I interpreted it as referring to <em>natural</em> satellites (e.g. a moon). So I wondered: Could a natural satellite exist in geostationary orbit?</p>

<p>Then I stopped and thought. For large gas giants, such as Jupiter, having moons too close to the planet can be fatal (for the moon). If it ventures inside the planet's Roche limit, it's toast. But there is good news: the Roche limit depends on both the masses and densities of the primary body and the satellite. So perhaps this reason is non-applicable, as a high-mass natural satellite might be able to survive. So the question changes:</p>

<p><strong>Could a sufficiently high-mass, high-density natural satellite occupy geostationary orbit over its primary body?</strong></p>
","<p>Of course, a natural satellite (moon) could have an orbital period equal to the spin period of its host (provided such an orbit would be accessible). However, the tidal friction that may generate such a locking is quite weak, so this would have to be a rare chance. Moreover, perturbations to the orbit from other moons or their host star may put the moon out of such an orbit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what is rather common is that a moon's orbital period equals their own (rather than their host's) spin period. This is exactly the case for the Earth Moon (you may say that Earth is on a ""selenostationary"" orbit) and naturally occurs form the tidal interaction of the planet with its moon.</p>

LADEE, or any other currently available technology?), but one interesting and extremely precise way is by laser ranging, pointing them towards one or more of the retroreflectors that were left on the surface of the Moon by the Apollo landers, in what is known as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment</a>. Since they are laid on the Moon's near side that <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/22/13"">is always pointed towards the Earth</a>, these retroreflectors are available for measurements to any properly equipped researcher, no matter which country they're from.</p>

<p>By measuring the time it takes for the light to reflect back, we can infer distance by simply multiplying the <em>c</em> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">speed of light in vacuum</a>) with the time taken between the light signal being transmitted and received and then dividing all of it by two to get a single leg of the distance. I'll let you read the linked to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia page on LLRE</a> for more information, but if you find that too boring, here's a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmVxSFnjYCA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube video on Mythbusters: Moon Hoax Retroreflectors</a> that explains it from the practical perspective.</p>

<p>As for results, again quoting that same Wikipedia page on LLRE:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of the findings of this long-term experiment are: </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The Moon is
  spiraling away from Earth at a rate of 3.8 cm (about 1.5 inches) per year. This rate
  has been described as anomalously high.</li>
  <li>The Moon probably has a
  liquid core of about 20% of the Moon's radius.</li>
  <li>The universal force
  of gravity is very stable. The experiments have put an upper limit on
  the change in Newton's gravitational constant G of less than 1 part in
  $10^{11}$ since 1969. The likelihood of any ""Nordtvedt effect"" (a
  composition-dependent differential acceleration of the Moon and Earth
  towards the Sun) has been ruled out to high precision, strongly
  supporting the validity of the Strong Equivalence Principle.</li>
  <li>Einstein's theory of gravity (the general theory of relativity)
  predicts the Moon's orbit to within the accuracy of the laser ranging
  measurements.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So these distance measurements are so precise they're a lot more interesting and reliable than merely telling us how far away the Moon is. For one, it also blows any Moon landing hoax theories right out of the water. Links to many more official results can be found in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment#References"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">references and external links sections of Wiki on LLRE</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a plethora of other ways to measure the distance to the Moon, with different precision and equipment requirements, but I will let others add some other methods in their answers.

I realized today that I own more than one barlow lens, and I was wondering if I could stack them together for looking at bright objects, like Jupiter. I'm aware that looking at anything else would probably be disastrous due to the stacked barlow lenses taking up more light. Is this an effective, or desirable way to approach the situation? What will happen if I do stack more than one barlow lens? Will it have the effect of an enhanced image, or will it do nothing but remove light?</p>
","<p>Yes, stacking Barlow lenses is a common practice to effectively increase focal length by multiplying their individual focal lengths. When I say common, most advanced eyepieces actually have many glass elements and are a type of a Barlow lens themselves, so just by using a single Barlow lens in front of your eyepiece you'd already be, technically, stacking Barlows. It is a technique that is particularly useful for bright object like our Solar system's planets, with Jupiter that you mention perhaps even the best example.</p>

<p>Your image quality might vary substantially tho with the Barlow and eyepiece quality of glass elements and the manufacturing precision. You might also want to play with the order at which you stack them and find an optimal arrangement of all of the glass elements they add to the system. The more precisely they're made, the less the order will matter though. And you'd technically want the less precise ones at the end of the stack, so their deficiencies don't magnify with each added element. And yes, with any additional glass element you'll be losing a bit of the illumination so this is, like mentioned, most suitable for bright objects.</p>

<p>Do not however, under any circumstances, do this when observing the Sun! You shouldn't need additional glass elements anyway, but should you try, you'll most certainly cause them to overheat, expand and permanently deform quite fast, regardless what material their tube and thread are made of, metal, alloy or plastic.</p>

After the explosion and condensation Neptune would get a huge ocean of water, later freezing to water ice, with an atmosphere of helium, and some less abundant gases like CO2, nitrogen, and argon, traces of water vapor. Traces of hydrogen and methane could survive the presence of oxygen. Hence some oxygen would remain in the atmosphere. Most of the CO2 would be resolved in the water ice.</p>

Hence for Neptun's escape velocity the kinetic energy of a hydrogen molecule is $$E=0.5\ mv^2=0.5\cdot 3.35\cdot 10^{-27}kg \cdot (23.5\cdot 10^3 m/s)^2 = 9.25\cdot 10^{-19} J.$$ Hence the energy needed to escape is more than 200-times the kinetic energy of the hydrogen molecules; no way to escape, 2000K or more would be needed to let escape some hydrogen over time (to get below a factor of about ten between the two energies). Photolyic dissociated atomic hydrogen would still need more than 1000K to escape.</p>

<p>The probability to catch asteroids or comets would be reduced due to the reduced radius, if the total mass is adjusted to the mass before combustion, since asteroids would miss instead of hit the planet.</p>

"Is it same distance Equator & Prime Meridian?","1677","","<p>i just want to ask in earth what  the difference between Equator &amp; Prime Meridian &amp; also want to know is it same distance Equator &amp; Prime Meridian?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cQqUF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cQqUF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>The Earth rotates daily about an axis. This axis of rotation intersects the surface of the Earth at the north and south poles. Imagine a plane that is normal to the axis of rotation and lies halfway between the north and south poles. The equator is the intersection of this plane and the surface of the Earth.</p>

<p>Meridians, or lines of longitude, go from pole to pole along a great circle. The Prime Meridian is simply the meridian that we have deemed to be the zero degrees line of longitude. This was an arbitrarily choice. (The French, for example, argued that the Prime Meridian should pass through the Observatory of Paris.)</p>

<p>Imagine going from the south pole to the north pole along the Prime Meridian. The Prime Meridian ends at the north pole. Continuing in the same direction takes you along the 180th degree longitude line. This means that if the Earth was a perfect sphere, the length of the equator would be exactly twice that of the prime meridian.</p>

<p>The Earth isn't a perfect sphere. The Earth's rotation gives the Earth a slight equatorial  bulge. The equator (at sea level) is about 21 km further from the center of the Earth than is the north pole. This means the Earth's equatorial circumference (40075 km) is about 67 kilometers longer than the Earth's meridional circumference (40008 km).</p>

<p>That this is a nice round number is not a coincidence. The original definition of the meter was one ten millionth of the distance at sea level between the equator and the north pole. A prototype metre bar was created based on initial estimates of this distance. It turned out that this initial estimate was a bit off, and by then it was too late to redefine the meter to match these better measurements.</p>

"Can planets inside the Earth's orbit around the Sun appear to undergo retrograde motion?","1671","","<p>Retrograde motion is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The apparent motion of the planets when they appear to move backward (from east to west) from the direction that they move ordinarily with respect to the stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can planets inside the Earth's orbit around the Sun appear to undergo retrograde motion?</p>
","<p>Both Mercury and Venus undergo retrograde motion, but are visually close to the Sun when this happens, so we don't notice it.</p>

<p>Below is Mercury's right ascension from May 15 to July 15 of this year. Note that it starts off increasing, then decreases (retrograde motion) and then increases again.</p>

Column meaning:

TIME

  Prior to 1962, times are UT1. Dates thereafter are UTC. Any 'b' symbol in
the 1st-column denotes a B.C. date. First-column blank ("" "") denotes an A.D.
date. Calendar dates prior to 1582-Oct-15 are in the Julian calendar system.
Later calendar dates are in the Gregorian system.

  Time tags refer to the same instant throughout the universe, regardless of
where the observer is located.

  The dynamical Coordinate Time scale is used internally. It is equivalent to
the current IAU definition of ""TDB"". Conversion between CT and the selected
non-uniform UT output scale has not been determined for UTC times after the
next July or January 1st.  The last known leap-second is used over any future
interval.

  NOTE: ""n.a."" in output means quantity ""not available"" at the print-time.

 R.A._(ICRF/J2000.0)_DEC =
   J2000.0 astrometric right ascension and declination of target center.
Adjusted for light-time. Units: HMS (HH MM SS.ff) and DMS (DD MM SS.f)

 APmag S-brt =
   Target's approximate apparent visual magnitude &amp; surface brightness. For
planets and satellites, values are available only for solar phase angles in the
range generally visible from Earth. This is to avoid extrapolation of models
beyond their valid (data-based) limits.
   Units: MAGNITUDE &amp; VISUAL MAGNITUDES PER SQUARE ARCSECOND

 delta  deldot =
   Range (""delta"") and range-rate (""delta-dot"") of target center with respect
to the observer at the instant light seen by the observer at print-time would
have left the target center (print-time minus down-leg light-time); the
distance traveled by a light ray emanating from the center of the target and
recorded by the observer at print-time. ""deldot"" is a projection of the
velocity vector along this ray, the light-time-corrected line-of-sight from the
coordinate center, and indicates relative motion. A positive ""deldot"" means the
target center is moving away from the observer (coordinate center). A negative
""deldot"" means the target center is moving toward the observer.
Units: AU and KM/S

 S-O-T /r =
    Sun-Observer-Target angle; target's apparent solar elongation seen from
observer location at print-time. If negative, the target center is behind
the Sun. Angular units: DEGREES.

    The '/r' column is a Sun-relative code, output for observing sites
with defined rotation models only.

         /T indicates target trails Sun (evening sky)
         /L indicates target leads Sun  (morning sky)

    NOTE: The S-O-T solar elongation angle is the total separation in any
direction. It does not indicate the angle of Sun leading or trailing.

 S-T-O =
   ""S-T-O"" is the Sun-&gt;Target-&gt;Observer angle; the interior vertex angle at
target center formed by a vector to the apparent center of the Sun at
reflection time on the target and the apparent vector to the observer at
print-time. Slightly different from true PHASE ANGLE (requestable separately)
at the few arcsecond level in that it includes stellar aberration on the
down-leg from target to observer.  Units: DEGREES

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of a 2-inch eyepiece versus a 1.25-inch eyepiece?","1666","","<p>I'm considering picking up some new eyepieces for my telescope and am interested in comparing 2-inch and 1.25-inch eyepieces. Are there any disadvantages to 2-inch eyepieces? Are 2-inch eyepieces only advantageous with longer eyepieces? </p>
","<p>When you look into the eyepiece, you've noticed that the image is round, framed by a black ring. That ring is called the <strong>field stop</strong>, and it's an actual round piece of metal or plastic inside the eyepiece. Its function is to limit the image to the size where the image quality in that eyepiece is acceptable.</p>

<p>If you were to remove the field stop, the image outside of it would start to look bad, and its edges would be fuzzy and barely usable. Also, most people prefer a neat, sharp edge to the field of view, so there's the esthetic element to consider also.</p>

<p>The size of the field stop is given by two parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <strong>focal length</strong> of the eyepiece, measured in mm</li>
<li>the <strong>apparent field of view</strong> of the eyepiece, or how wide the image appears when you look in the eyepiece, measured in degrees of angle</li>
</ul>

<p>Longer focal length eyepieces will naturally have bigger field stops, keeping everything else in proportion. Eyepieces with a wider field of view will also require a bigger field stop.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> the field stop, obviously, must be smaller than the diameter of the barrel of the eyepiece, otherwise it would not fit in. This is what dictates the lower limit for the diameter of the barrel. The barrel must be bigger than the field stop. You need to increase the barrel diameter when the field stop grows too big.</p>

<p>So, when you stick to short focal length eyepieces with a narrow field of view, the required field stop is pretty small, and it can easily fit into a 1.25"" barrel.</p>

<p>But with longer focal length eyepieces, especially with modern eyepieces with a wide field of view, the field stop can grow pretty large, and eventually becomes bigger than the 1.25"" barrel. That's when you need to move up to a 2"" barrel. That's what drives the need for larger size barrels.</p>

<p>Long time ago, there used to be eyepieces with 0.965"" barrel diameter, because back then opticians didn't know how to make wide field eyepieces. Then the field of view kept increasing, so opticians moved up to 1.25"".</p>

<p>Eventually the newer 2"" standard was adopted, as the field of view kept growing. At 32mm focal length, a Plossl eyepiece with a 52 degree field of view can fit in a 1.25"" barrel, but a more recent 68 degree design requires 2"".</p>

<p>Nowadays there's a new standard emerging, with a 3"" barrel diameter, imposed by the very wide field eyepiece designs invented recently. At 30mm focal length, an eyepiece with an 82 degree field of view could use a 2"" barrel, but if you demand 100 degrees FoV at 30mm, you need to move up to 3"".</p>

<p>Of course, larger barrel diameters make heavier and more expensive eyepieces. So you need to mix and match. At smaller focal lengths, the 1.25"" barrel works well. For longer focal length eyepieces, as you move up in terms of the size of the field of view, eventually you must switch to 2"".</p>

<p>If you only use Plossl eyepieces, you can have all of them in the 1.25"" format, because even at the longest focal lengths that make sense in practice, the Plossl field of view is narrow enough to not require a big field stop.</p>

<p>As a practical example, my collection of eyepieces currently is about evenly split between 1.25"" and 2"", with the 2"" barrels being reserved for eyepieces over 18mm focal length. All my eyepieces have an 82 degree field of view.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, with a bigger barrel the eyepiece is larger, there's more glass in it, it's heavier and it can be more expensive. This is why manufacturers try to use the smaller barrels when it makes sense, and switch to bigger barrels only when physics and math force them to take this step.</p>

<p>If you need a certain focal length combined with a certain field of view, and that requires a bigger barrel, then by all means use that size. It's kind of a mix-and-match situation.</p>

"How deep and shaped is the depth of a black hole?","1658","","<p>A common representation of a black hole is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole"">black circle</a> which if I'm correct, indicates its breadth.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html"">This representation</a> depicts it as a 'plate', so a really small depth compared to its breadth.</p>

<p>On this <a href=""http://phys.org/news154627589.html"">other representation</a>, its depth has a funnel shape.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>

<p>How deep and what shape has the depth of a black hole ?</p>
","<p>The first representation isn't depicting the black hole; it's depicting its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disc"" rel=""nofollow"">accretion disk</a>, which is indeed plate-shaped. The accretion disk is around the black hole, and - if it's a rotating (Kerr) black hole - it's perpendicular to the black hole's axis of rotation. Accretion disks are disk-shaped, and so the representation is disk-shaped.</p>

<p>The other is a common representation of a black hole, but it's misleading. It's an extension of the ""rubber sheet"" analogy, which describes the bending of spacetime. A heavy object, placed on a semi-taut sheet, will curve it a little bit. This represents ordinary matter curving spacetime. A black hole is represented in that image as bending spacetime by an infinite amount. The issue is that this representation embeds the two-dimensional representation of spacetime in three dimensional space, making it appear as if the black hole has this extra depth. Black holes are not embedded in an extra spatial dimension.</p>

<p>Note also that the small object moving near the edge of the black hole is also represented by a tiny funnel. The creator seems to have tried to take the analogy to the extreme, portraying the object's funnel as finite, and the black hole's as either extremely large or infinite, in an attempt to explain that light cannot escape from a black hole. It's not too accurate, but it works to get the point across.</p>

<p>By the way, black holes do have size (the central point singularities of non-rotating black holes are infinitely tiny, while the ring singularities of rotating black holes are in the shapes of infinitely thin rings). You might want to read up on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon"" rel=""nofollow"">event horizons</a>. The radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole is a finite number, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius"" rel=""nofollow"">Schwarzschild radius</a>. It is calculated as
$$r_s=\frac{2GM}{c^2}$$</p>

<p>In this case, the event horizon is spherical. In rotating black holes, it may be in the shape of an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblate_spheroid"" rel=""nofollow"">oblate spheroid</a>.</p>

"What is a singularity? What is at the center of a black hole? Specifically regarding space-time","1654","","<p>So because I can only really think of space-time in 2-dimensions like a sheet of something, my assumptions might be wrong to begin with. I was watching a YouTube video on black-holes and there was a quip regarding black holes and their warping of space time, to the point where the narrator said something along the lines of <em>“there is nothing at the center of the black hole but gravity has warped space time so much that it's this ’pinhole’ like affect that causes the blackhole behavior”</em>.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>When a star dies and collapses into a black hole, what is at its center? The star's mass compacted into the size of the plank length, or something similarly small? <strong>Is there really nothing at the center of a black hole? Surely, the core collapsed into something really small right?</strong></li>
<li>What is meant by singularity? Is it just the warping of space-time that makes it this way?</li>
</ol>
","<p>This is more of a question for the Physics stack, but I'll give it a shot, since it's fairly basic.</p>

<p>You need to understand something before we begin. The theoretical framework we have to gauge and answer this sort of thing is called General Relativity, which was proposed by Einstein in 1915. It describes things such as gravity, black holes, or just about any phenomena where large densities of mass or energy are involved.</p>

<p>There's another chapter in Physics called Quantum Mechanics. This describes, usually, what happens at very small scales - things that are super-tiny.</p>

<p>Both GR and QM are fine in their own way. Both are tested against reality and work very well. <em>But they are not compatible with each other.</em> Meaning: you cannot describe a phenomenon from a GR and a QM perspective, both at once. Or meaning: we don't have a coherent set of equations that we could write down, and then ""extract"" out of them either a GR-like view of reality, or a QM-like view.</p>

<p>The problem is, the center of a black hole is both very high mass density and very high gravity (and therefore right in the field of GR), and very small (and therefore ""quantum-like""). To properly deal with it, we'd have to reconcile GR and QM and work with both at once. <em>This is not possible with current physics.</em></p>

<p>We pretty much have to stick to GR only for now, when talking about black holes. This basically means that anything we say about the center of a black hole is probably incomplete, and subject to further revision.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A star dies, collapses into a black hole, what is at the center? The
  star's mass compacted into the size of the plank length or something
  similarly small? Is there really nothing at the center of a black
  hole?, surely the core collapsed into something, just really small
  right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to General Relativity, it collapses all the way down to nothing. Not just ""very small"", but smaller and smaller until it's exactly zero in size. Density becomes infinite.</p>

<p>You can't say ""Plank length"" because, remember, we can't combine GR and QM, we just don't know how. All we have here is GR, and GR says it goes all the way down.</p>

<p>I'm using words such as ""size"" (which implies space) and ""becomes"" (which implies time). But both space and time in the context of a black hole are very seriously warped. The ""becoming"" of a black hole all the way down to the zero-size dot is a reality only for the unlucky observer that gets caught in it. But for a distant, external observer, this process is slowed and extended all the way to plus infinity (it's only complete after an infinitely long time). Both observers are correct, BTW.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>So, when we are saying ""density is infinite and size is zero at the singularity"", this language applies to the unfortunate observer being dragged down in the middle of the initial collapse of the star.</p>

<p>But from the perspective of the distant observer, a black hole is still a chunk of mass (the original star) in a non-zero volume (the event horizon of the BH). To this observer, the density of that object is finite, and its size is definitely not zero. From this perspective, anything falling into the BH never quite finishes falling, but just slows down more and more.</p>

<p>Both observers are correct. So, keep in mind, when I talk about ""infinite density"", that's the inside observer point of view.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is a singularity? Is it just the warping of space time that makes
  it this way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You get a singularity whenever there's a division by zero in the equations, or when the equations misbehave somehow at that point. There are many different kinds of singularities in science.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_singularity"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_singularity</a></p>

<p>In the context of a black hole, the center is said to be a gravitational singularity, because density and gravity are suggested to become infinite, according to the GR equations.</p>

<p>GR says: when you have a lump of matter that's big enough, it starts to collapse into itself so hard, there's nothing to stop it. It keeps falling and falling into itself, with no limit whatsoever. Extrapolate this process, and it's easy to see that the size of it tends to zero, and density tends to an infinite value.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Put another way - if density becomes large enough, gravity is so huge, no other force is strong enough to resist it. It just crushes all barriers that matter raises to oppose further crushing. That lump of matter simply crushes itself, its own gravity pulls it together smaller and smaller... and smaller... and so on. According to current theories, there's nothing to stop it (QM might stop it, but we cannot prove it, because we don't have the math). So it just spirals down in a vicious cycle of ever-increasing gravity that increases itself.</p>

<p>Space and time are really pathologic inside the event horizon. If you are already inside, there's no way out. This is not because you can't move out fast enough, but because <em>there's really no way out</em>. No matter which way you turn, you're looking towards the central singularity - in both space and time. There is no conceivable trajectory that you could draw, starting from the inside of the event horizon, that leads outside. All trajectories point at the singularity. All your possible futures, if you're inside the event horizon, end at the central singularity.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, why the center of a black hole is called a ""singularity""? Because all sorts of discontinuities and divisions by zero jump out of the equations, when you push math to the limit, trying to describe the very center of a black hole, within a GR frame.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity</a></p>

<p>Speaking in general, physicists don't like singularities. In most cases, this is an indication that the mathematical apparatus has broken down, and some other calculations are necessary at that point. Or it might indicate that new physics are taking place there, superseding the old physics.</p>

<p>One last thing: just because we don't have a combined GR/QM theory to fully describe the center of black holes, that doesn't mean a pure GR research in this area is ""wrong"" or ""useless"". It doesn't mean one could imagine some arbitrary fantasy taking place inside a black hole.</p>

<p>Astronomers these days are starting to <a href=""http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2013/4c2930/"">observe cosmic objects that are very much like black holes</a>, and their observed properties are in very close accord with what GR predicts for such things. So research in this field must continue, because it's clearly on the right track, at least in the ways we can verify today in astronomy.</p>

<p>You should be aware that for the celestial sphere you look from the centre towards the inside of the surface of the sphere, while for geographical purposes you look from the outside (above) towards the spheroid (down). So if you project the stars on a globe like this, you will notice that the constellations will look inverted from what you're used to in star maps. If you find one of those old celestial globes, you will also see the inverted constellations. For instance on <a href=""http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/17.-Mercator-globe1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">this image</a>, you'll see Leo to the left of Virgo and Hercules, while on most star maps, Leo will be to the right.</p>

<p>If you want the constellations to look 'right' then you would need to use LONGITUDE = -RA*15 (mind the minus sign). But then you would also need to invert the rotation of the Earth as well. </p>

"Is the influence of gravity instantaneous?","1596","","<p>When I was in college, I posed to my astronomy professor a thought experiment that had been puzzling my mind for some time: ""If the all matter in the Sun magically disappeared, instantly, how long would it take its gravity to stop having an effect on us?"" His response was that the force of gravity is instant, unlike the speed of light, which appears instant.</p>

<p>My big question, now, is: <strong>""Do we know it's instant?""</strong> We can't possibly move an object large enough to have a noticeable gravitational influence fast enough to measure if it creates (or doesn't create) a doppler-like phenomenon.</p>

<p>If he was wrong, <strong>how do we know it's not?</strong></p>
","<p>The first question as stated has a rather trivial answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""If the sun magically disappeared, instantly, <strong>along with all its influences</strong>, how long would it take its gravity to stop having an effect on us?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the Sun's gravity is among its influences, it would instantly stop having an effect on us. That's just part of the magical situation, and doesn't even involve any physics. A bit more interesting is the question without the bolded part.</p>

<p>In general relativity, changes in the gravitational field propagate at the speed of light. Thus, one might expect that the magical and instant disappearance of the Sun would not affect earth for about eight minutes, since that's how long light from the Sun takes to reach Earth.</p>

<p>However, this is mistaken because the instant disappearance of the Sun itself violates general relativity, as the Einstein field equation enforces a kind of <em>local</em> conservation law on the stress-energy tensor analogous to the non-divergence of the magnetic field in the electromagnetism: in any small neighborhood of spacetime, there are no local sources or sinks of stress-energy; it must come from somewhere and go somewhere. Since the magical instant disappearance of the Sun violates general relativity, it does not make sense to use that theory to predict what happens in such a situation.</p>

<p>Thus, the Sun's gravity instantly ceasing any effect on the Earth is just as consistent with general relativity as having any sort of time-delay. Or to be precise, it's no more inconsistent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My big question, now, is: ""How do we know it's instant?"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not instant, but it can appear that way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can't possibly move an object large enough to have a noticeable gravitational influence fast enough to measure if it creates (or doesn't create) a doppler-like phenomenon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don't have to: solar system dynamics are quite fast enough. An simple calculation due to Laplace in the early nineteenth century concluded that if gravity aberrated, Earth's orbit would crash into the Sun on the time-scale of about four centuries. Thus gravity does not aberrate appreciably--more careful analyses concluded that in the Newtonian framework, the speed of gravity must be more than $2\times10^{10}$ the speed of light to be consistent with the observed lack of aberration.</p>

<p>This may seem quite a bit puzzling with how it fits with general relativity's claim that changes in the gravitational field propagate at the speed of light, but it's actually not that peculiar. As an analogy, the electric field of a uniformly moving electric charge is directed toward the instantaneous position of the charge--<em>not</em> where the charge used to be, as one might expect from a speed of light delay. This doesn't mean that electromagnetism propagates instantaneously--if you wiggle the charge, that information will be limited by $c$, as the electromagnetic field changes in response to your action. Instead, it's just something that's true for <em>uniformly moving</em> charges: the electric field ""anticipates"" where the change will be if no influence acts on it. If the charge velocity changes slowly enough, it will look like electromagnetism is instantaneous, even though it really isn't.</p>

<p>Gravity does this even better: the gravitational field of a uniformly accelerating mass is toward its current position. Thus, gravity ""anticipates"" where the mass will be based on not just current velocity, but also acceleration. Thus, if conditions are such that the acceleration of gravitating bodies changes slowly (as is the case in the solar system), gravity will look instantaneous. But this is only approximately true if the acceleration changes slowly--it's just a very good approximation under the conditions of the solar system. After all, Newtonian gravity works well.</p>

<p>A detailed analysis of this can be found in Steve Carlip's <em>Aberration and the Speed of Gravity</em>, Phys.Lett.A <strong>267</strong>:81-87 (2000) [arXiV:<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9909087"">gr-qc/9909087</a>].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If he was wrong, <strong>how do we know it's not?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a lot of evidence for general relativity, but the best current evidence that gravitational radiation behaves as GTR says it does is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulse%E2%80%93Taylor_binary"">Hulse-Taylor binary</a>. However, there is no direct observation of gravitational radiation yet. The connection between the degree of apparent cancellation of velocity-dependent effects in both electromagnetism and gravity, including its connection with the dipole nature of EM radiation and quadrupole nature of gravitational radiation, can also be found in Carlip's paper.</p>

"What happens to oxygen produced on the Sun (or other stars)?","1591","","<p>Through nuclear fusion, the Sun can (or at the very least, someday will) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process"">produce atoms of all elements up to and including oxygen</a>.  And in terrestrial chemistry at least, when you combine oxygen, hydrogen, and a small amount of heat you get water.  Or lithium and oxygen and heat will produce lithium oxide.  Those individual components are all readily available in a star like the Sun.</p>

<p>So my questions is, does the oxygen produced by the Sun (or any other star, now, in the future, or in the past) react chemically (for instance, through oxidation or combustion processes) with the other elements present in the star's atmosphere?  </p>

<p>Or I suppose more generally, do the elements formed through nuclear fusion in a star chemically interact to produce more complex molecules (and if not, then why not)?</p>
","<p>The Sun is a small main sequence star. It does not produce oxygen via fusion. It can't. The temperature and pressure in the Sun's core are too low. Fusion in the Sun is currently limited to production of helium. This will remain the case for several billion years.</p>

<p>That said, there is oxygen in the Sun, about 1% by mass. This oxygen was produced long ago by other stars at the end stages of their lives. Our Sun is a third generation (or more) star. Most of the Sun is far too hot for those oxygen atoms to combine chemically. One exception is sunspots, relatively cool areas on the Sun's photosphere. (Relatively cool means less than 4500 kelvins, so still quite hot.) Molecules can form at these lowish temperatures, and scientists do see signatures of many different molecules in the light coming from the Sun.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Update, in response to edits to the question</strong></p>

<p>Molecules cannot form inside of a star. The temperatures are just too high. Molecules decompose (split apart) into their constituent parts at high temperatures. The Sun's photosphere is about 5800 kelvins, which is already too hot to sustain very many molecules. Temperature rises rapidly with increasing depth below the photosphere. The Sun's core temperature is about 15 million kelvins (27 million Fahrenheit), and the Sun is a small star. Larger stars have even higher core temperatures. At 15 million kelvins, there aren't even atoms, let alone molecules. There are instead atomic nuclei and electrons. Atoms are stripped of their electrons at those extreme temperatures.</p>

<p>In five to seven billion years, our Sun will have fused all of the hydrogen in the core into helium. That's when our Sun will become a red giant. Even then, it still will not produce oxygen. The first stage a one solar mass star experiences after leaving the main sequence is the red giant phase, where the core is an inert mass of helium surrounded by a shell of fusing hydrogen.</p>

<p>Eventually (after another billion years or so), the temperature of that helium core will rise to the point where the helium starts fusing into carbon, plus a little bit of oxygen via the first step on the alpha ladder. At this point, the Sun will leave the red giant phase and join the horizontal branch of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. This is a rather short-lived phase of a star's life. The carbon and oxygen produced by helium fusion quickly (in stellar timeframes) form an inert core. At that point, our sun will become an asymptotic red giant.</p>

<p>The red giant and asymptotic red giant phases are rather messy affairs, wracked by convulsions where the star expels lots of gas. Our Sun will lose about half its mass to such convulsions. Molecules do form when this expelled gas cools. This results in some of the prettiest pictures in astronomy, shown below.</p>

"Is the Milky Way Visible from Nebraska?","1589","","<p>Is the Milky Way Visible from Nebraska?  If so, where is the best place to view it, and also what would be the best time of night to see it?  I know this is probably a very novice question, just trying to get a better understanding of what I can see.  If it helps, I'm south of Omaha.</p>
","<p>Well, because the axis of the rotation of the Earth is not the same as the axis of rotation of the disk of the Milky Way (and also because we're transforming a 2-dimensional spherical map into a 2-dimensional cartesian map), the path of the disk of the Milky Way galaxy looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8E4em.gif"" alt=""milkywaydisk""></p>

<p>So, there is actually a wide range in declination that the Milky Way can be seen at. The range of declination you can see depends on your latitude (for a review of RA and declination, coordinates used in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_coordinate_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">celestial coordinate system</a>, see this <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/9/could-someone-explain-ra-dec-in-simple-terms/41#41"">post</a>). For example, here in Philadelphia (just about $+40^{\circ}$ declination), I'd be able to see from from $-50^{\circ}$ to $+90^{\circ}$ in declination. For Nebraska, find the latitude of your location. To calculate the lower limit, add your latitude (which will be positive since you're in the northern hemisphere) to $-90^{\circ}$ (mine was $+40^{\circ}$, so: $-90^{\circ} + 40^{\circ} = -50^{\circ}$). To find the upper limit in declination, it's even easier. Since you're in the northern hemisphere, you can actually see the north celestial pole. This means that the upper limit is simply the maximum it can possibly be, which is $+90^{\circ}$. The larger the latitude the more <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumpolar_star"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">circumpolar</a> your night sky gets. </p>

<p>The good news is that you should definitely be able to see it in Nebraska. The only question during what season will you see it at its best? Take a look at the constellations which contain parts of the Milky Way and find the season you can see it in - now you know where to look. </p>

<p>The last thing I want to add is that you need nice dark conditions. Local weather conditions or sources of light pollution may very easily hide the Milky Way. From Philadelphia, even on perfectly clear nights we have no chance of seeing it. If you've got a city on one of your horizons, try to plan around that - either go to a darker location or try looking opposite in the sky from any sources of light pollution.</p>

"Is it possible that all dark matter is made of rogue planets (free-floating planet)?","1585","","<p>Is it possible that all dark matter is made of rogue planets (free-floating planet)? (and other stuff like asteroids or meteoroids)</p>
","<p>First of all I'll start with a few ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Baryonic Matter</em>: Baryons are elementary particles made up of 3 quarks. This includes protons and neutrons, and the term <em>baryonic matter</em> refers to matter made of baryons, such as atoms. Examples of non-baryonic matter includes neutrinos, free electrons and other exotic matter.</li>
<li>Things like planets, stars, dust, etc. are all made of atoms, and so are classified as baryonic matter.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, <em>how do we know that dark matter is present in the universe?</em> </p>

<p>Astronomers measure the gravitational pull of galaxies and galaxy groups/clusters based on how objects behave when interacting with these objects. Some examples of this include tidal gas/dust stripping, the orbit of stars in a galaxy and gravitational lensing of distant light from a large cluster. Using this they determine the mass of the galaxy (or galaxy group).
We can also determine the mass of a galaxy or group by looking at it and adding up the mass of all the objects (like stars, dust, gas, black holes, and other baryonic matter). While these methods both give us approximations, it is clear that the gravitational mass of galaxies and groups exceeds the baryonic mass by a factor of 10-100.</p>

<p>When astrophysicists first found this phenomenon they had to come up with a plausible explanation, so they suggested that there is some new, invisible matter called dark matter. (Aside: some astrophysicists also came up with other explanations like modified gravity, but so far dark matter does the best job at explaining observations).</p>

<p>Okay, so now <em>how do we know dark matter is not any sort of baryonic matter?</em></p>

<p>There are a few reasons astrophysicists know that it is extremely unlikely that dark matter is baryonic. First of all if all the stars in a galaxy shine on an object it heats up, this heat causes the release of radiation, called <em>thermal radiation</em>, and every (baryonic) object above zero kelvin (or -273.14 deg celcius) emits this radiation. However, dark matter does not emit any radiation at all (hence the name dark!) </p>

<p>If dark matter were baryonic it would also mean that it could become light emitting. If we got a clump of baryonic matter* and put it in space it would gravitationally contract, and would eventually form a star or black hole** - both of which we would be able to see.</p>

<p>So, because of these reasons the dark matter in galaxies and in galaxy groups/clusters <em>cannot</em> be baryonic, and so cannot be planets, dead stars, asteroids, etc. It would definetely not be planets as there is <strong>no way</strong> 10-100 times the mass of the stars in a galaxy would be planets, as the mechanism for making planets relies on supernovae, and the number of supernovae needed for the that many planets would be far too high to match our observations. I hope that this answered your question!</p>

<p>*provided the clump of baryonic matter was large, and the amount there is in galaxies definitely is!</p>

<p>** we don't observe black holes directly, but can see radiation from their accretion disks.</p>

"Is Pluto a ""proto-planet""?","1584","","<p>My question is this : could the Charon-Pluto system becomes in the coming few millions years a full fledged planet, as in the IAU classification ?</p>

<ul>
<li>The system orbit isn't on the ecliptic</li>
<li>The system hasn't cleared its neighborhood</li>
</ul>

<p>So, is it possible that that system isn't stabilized yet, and that 1) its orbit is very slowly changing (for lack of a better word) to the ecliptic, and 2) that the system will slowly collapse, and bring all its moons with it, to clear its neighborhood ?</p>

<p>In other words, is Pluto a ""proto-planet"" (as I would personally name it), or definitely (and for the next millions years) a dwarf planet ?</p>

Moreover, the question was asked in a broader canvas, to know if it was possible that some elements of the solar system (Pluto, but not only) could be instable enough to reach the level of planet sometime in the futur.</p>
","<p>The question says a few interesting things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The system orbit isn't on the ecliptic</li>
<li>The system hasn't cleared its neighbourhood</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not going to change in the next few million years - or ever.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90482_Orcus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Orcus</a> is an interesting counter-example.  It is in a similar orbit to Pluto - similar aphelion, perihelion and eccentricity, similar orbital period (to within a year or so) and an inclination of around 20 degrees, a little more than Pluto.</p>

<p>In short, in orbital terms Orcus is as much a planet as Pluto is - <strong>except of course</strong> it's only around half the diameter and has far less mass.</p>

<p>Pluto is never going to displace Orcus from its orbit. In fact they were both pushed into their orbits by Neptune and the <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/12228/classification-of-the-kozai-mechanism"">Kozai mechanism</a>, which causes its inclination. They will never be able to clear their orbits because Neptune dominates the area.</p>

<p>To answer the final part of the question - Pluto is officially regarded a dwarf planet by the current definition. Partly because of its orbit as your question states. Whether it's also a protoplanet or not may be debatable. I'd say it's too big to be considered a protoplanet because it's too big. (The larger asteroids like Ceres, Vesta etc. are probably closer to that size range.)</p>

"Do black holes have energy?","1580","","<p>So black holes are created by certain dying stars and when the star runs out of nuclear energy gravity wins out and the star implodes. An entire star’s mass collapses down into a smaller and smaller volume of space. Which then creates a black hole, so my question is, do black holes actually have energy to create that type of vacuum to suck light in?</p>

<p>If a black hole was created by a huge star running out of fuel and then collapsing in on it self, would the black hole have energy and if so where would it come from, or is it just like the vacuum in space with no energy at all?</p>

<p>(Please correct me if I said anything wrong about the black holes as I am very young and don't quiet grasp the concept of it yet.)</p>
","<p>An isolated black hole is a vacuum solution of general relativity, so in a very direct sense it does not contain any energy anywhere in spacetime. But perhaps somewhat counter-intuitively, that does not imply that such a black hole has no energy.</p>

<p>Defining the total amount of energy is usually very problematic in general relativity, but in some special cases it is possible. In particular, the usual black hole solutions are all asymptotically flat, i.e., spacetime is just the usual flat Minkowski when far away from the black hole.</p>

<p>Here (or in general when we have a prescribed asymptotic form of the spacetime), we can calculate the total energy-momentum, by essentially measuring the gravitational field of the black hole at infinity. The energy just be one component of energy-momentum. </p>

<p>There are actually two relevant different kinds of 'infinity' here: spatial infinity and null (lightlike) infinity, depending on whether we are 'far away' from the black hole in a spacelike or lightlike direction. There's also timelike infinity, but that just corresponds to waiting an arbitrarily long time, so it's not relevant here. The two different infinities beget different definitions of energy-momentum, giving the the <strong>ADM energy</strong> and the <strong>Bondi energy</strong>, respectively. In a vacuum, the intuitive difference between the two is that Bondi energy excludes gravitational waves.</p>

<p>So the short answer is 'yes', with the caveat that in a more complicated situation, where we can't attribute everything to the black hole itself, the answer to <em>how much</em> energy is due to the black hole may be ambiguous or ill-defined.</p>

<p>Note that the ADM and Bondi energy-momenta also define their corresponding measures of <strong>mass</strong>, as the norm of those energy-momenta ($m^2 = E^2-p^2$), but for a black hole we can also define mass more operationally in terms of orbits around the black hole. There are also other alternatives for addressing mass specifically.</p>

"How small would you have to crush an object for it to become a black hole?","1559","","<p>I was wondering how much you had to crush an object for it to become a black hole. Recently I learned that anything could become a black hole (even you) if it were crushed down small enough, for example our sun would have to be crushed to the size of Manhattan to become a black hole (According to a video I saw). I did a little research and found out that something would have to be crushed down to Schwarzchild radius meaning all of that objects mass would have to be crushed into that objects radius. But if you say crush the sun down to the size of Manhattan, that is much smaller than the sun's actual radius. So I haven't really gotten a clear answer and I'm a little confused, thanks for clarifying =)</p>
","<p>Well, I wasn't going to answer but the other two answers are wrong, or at least incomplete. If you wish to make a black hole from a stellar-sized object, then there is no need to compress it to as small as the Schwarzschild radius (though that would certainly work and would certainly be the answer for smaller objects with negligible self-gravity). Instead, you just need to compress it to a size at which it cannot be possibly supported by any plausible equation of state against further gravitational collapse. It turns out that this is somewhat bigger than the Schwarzschild radius and hence the density required is considerably lower. More details below.</p>

<p>There is a radius, larger than the Schwarzschild radius at which a neutron star, quark matter, whatever its equation of state, cannot be supported against collapse.</p>

<p>There are limits imposed by causality and General Relativity on the structure of compact stars. In ""Black Holes, White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars"" by Shapiro &amp; Teukolsky, pp.260-261, it is shown, approximately, that even if the equation of state hardens to the point where the speed of sound equals the speed of light, that $(GM/Rc^2)&lt;0.405$. </p>

<p>The Schwarzschild radius is $R_s=2GM/c^2$ and therefore $R &gt; 1.23 R_s$ for stability. This limit is reached for a neutron star with $M \simeq 3.5 M_{\odot}$. A more accurate treatment in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3510"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lattimer (2013)</a> suggests that a maximally compact neutron star has $R\geq 1.41R_s$.</p>

<p>If the equation of state is softer, then collapse will occur at smaller masses, and higher densities but at a similar multiple of $R_s$.</p>

<p>Thus it is not necessary to compress matter within $R_s$ to form a black hole.</p>

<p>The picture below (from <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Natur.467.1081D"" rel=""noreferrer"">Demorest et al. 2010</a>) shows the mass-radius relations for a wide variety of equations of state. The limits in the top-left of the diagram indicate the limits imposed by (most stringently) the speed of sound being the speed of light (labelled ""causality"" and which gives radii slightly larger than Shapiro &amp; Teukolsky's approximate result) and then in the very top left, the border marked by ""GR"" coincides with the Schwarzschild radius. Neutron stars become unstable where their mass-radius curves peak, so stable neutron stars are always significantly larger than $R_s$ at all masses. </p>

"Which lens and magnification is best to see planets?","1553","","<p>I just bought a Celestron Travel Scope 70 and it comes with a 20mm and a 10mm eyepiece. I get a good view of the Moon but I am not able to see Jupiter, Saturn or Mars as expected. I read about the Barlow lens but I am not sure how much magnification is required to view these planets. So based on my telescope, which lens should I go for? And should I also get Red/Blue filters to view them?</p>
","<h2>Eyepieces</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://stargazerslounge.com/topic/113230-highest-useful-magnification/"" rel=""nofollow"">highest useful magnification</a> of the Celestron Travel Scope 70 is about 165x. However, you are unlikely to find that much magnification to be usable except under very ideal conditions (""good seeing"" i.e. clear atmospheric conditions, dark skies with no light pollution, viewing on a night with a new moon, etc). Even then the image at the eyepiece is going to be dim at that magnification.</p>

<p>Any telescope can in theory achieve an unlimited magnification. But in practice, its magnifying power is limited by the amount of light the telescope is taking in, which is to say, its aperture. The telescope is only collecting so much light. Every increase in magnification is zooming in on a smaller and smaller area, which means it is looking at a smaller and smaller fraction of the original amount of light.</p>

<p>On your telescope, the aperture is 70mm. This is the main thing that dictates how bright of an object you can hope to see at the eyepiece. There is another stat that is important to figuring out what eyepieces are likely to show you, though, and that is the telescope's focal length. Your scope has a 400mm focal length. <a href=""http://astronomyonline.org/Science/TelescopeMagnification.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">Total magnification</a> is the focal length of the telescope divided by the focal length of the eyepiece.</p>

<p>Your telescope came with two eyepieces:</p>

<p>400mm (telescope focal length) / 20mm (eyepiece focal length) = 20x magnification<br>
400mm (telescope focal length) / 10mm (eyepiece focal length) = 40x magnification</p>

<p>As you can see, the smaller the eyepiece focal length, the greater the final magnification. If you tried an 8mm eyepiece, you'd get a 50x magnification. To get a 65x magnification, you'd need somewhere around a 6.2mm eyepiece.</p>

<p>(Interesting aside: Since the magnification also depends on the telescope's focal length, note that each eyepiece will have a different magnification depending on the telescope it is in.)</p>

<p>Before you go buying any extra eyepieces, though, I'd strongly recommend you go see what you can see with the equipment you already have! You should certainly be able to see Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jupiter will appear as a disc. You can see its four Galilean moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, so-named after the first person to see them, Galileo. They appear as points of light around the disc of Jupiter. </p></li>
<li><p>For Saturn, you should be able to make out the rings poking out either side of Saturn's disc. They look like tiny little teacup handles. You can also see Saturn's largest moon, Titan. </p></li>
<li><p>Mars is a little bit less exciting, but it should be visible as a reddish disc.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>If you do opt to buy another eyepiece, one thing to pay attention to is eye relief. Eye relief is how far away from the eyepiece you can be to still see a decent image. Eyepieces with shorter eye relief are cheaper, but they are also harder to use. An eye relief around 6mm to 8mm is much more comfortable for me.</p>

<p>As for me, I can never help myself: for every telescope I've owned, I always buy an eyepiece that pushes the limits of my telescope, just to see what it looks like. But from experience, I can tell you it is not a great view. Still, it can be fun to see what your equipment can do. But before you jump all the way to an eyepiece that gives you 130x magnification (or whatever), I'd say to shoot solidly for the middle range of your scope (in your case, maybe 60x - 80x). If you can afford it, buy a mid range eyepiece with decent eye relief and field of view (FOV). You'll be much happier with the view through this eyepiece than you will an eyepiece that maxes out the magnification.</p>

<h2>Filters</h2>

<p>Do yourself a favor and at least pick up a lunar filter. They filter a certain percentage of the light and allow the rest through without modifying the color. The moon is so bright, it will make your eyes water trying to look at it through even a modest telescope. Lunar filters make looking at the moon a much more enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>My question: what is the most recent, best estimate, to the greatest precision, of the Sun's mass?  Obviously, citable, primary sources only!</p>
","<p>The mass of the Sun is determined from Kepler's laws:</p>

<p>$$\frac{4\pi^2\times(1\,\mathrm{AU})^3}{G\times(1\,\mathrm{year})^2}$$</p>

<p>Each term in this component contributes to both the value of the solar mass and our uncertainty. First, we know to very good precision that <a href=""http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html"" rel=""nofollow"">the (sidereal) year is</a> 365.256363004 days. We have also <a href=""http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU2012_English.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">defined the astronomical unit (AU)</a> to be 149597870700 m. Strictly speaking, the semi-major axis of the Earth's orbit is slightly different, but by very little in the grand scheme of things (see below).</p>

<p>At this point, we can solve for the product $GM$, known as the <em>gravitational parameter</em>, sometimes denoted $\mu$. <a href=""http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?constants"" rel=""nofollow"">For the Sun,</a>
$$\mu_\odot=132712440018\pm9\,\mathrm{km}^3\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2}$$</p>

<p>So solve for $M_\odot$, we need the gravitational constant $G$, which, as it turns out, is by far the largest contributor to the uncertainty in the solar mass. The <a href=""http://physics.nist.gov/constants"" rel=""nofollow"">current CODATA value</a> is $6.67384\pm0.00080\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}^2\cdot\mathrm{kg}^{-2}$, which all combines to give

"Less stars in the night, compared to 15-20 years back","1539","","<p>I am not sure if my question is true or not. But this is what I observe regularly. When I was young and when I look at the sky, there were too many many stars were there. But now, from few months I'm observing the sky (by eyes, not any telescope), I see very few stars. Perhaps, countable.</p>

<p>Is it because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Stars are dead?</strong> (Not all) As I read somewhere, by the time you see the star, it would have been dead. Because, the light would've traveled so many years to reach earth. By the time, star would have completed 'X' light years and it is dead by now?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current position of the earth in galaxy</strong>: As I read, the earth will not always traverse in the same path around the sun. So the current view from the earth to the sky, may not have any star? (This is my guess/imagination, I'm not sure)</p></li>
<li><p>Is it because of the city light/ pollution?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> Please be easy. May be the question is broad or simple, just want to know the brief answer and if its complete explanatory, I'm happy for that.</p>
","<p>In my own case, if I see fewer stars than I did when I was younger, it's partly because my eyes have deteriorated with age. I don't know whether that applies to you.</p>

<p>The most likely explanation is increased light pollution. If you can manage to get to an area far enough away from city lights, on a cloudless and moonless night, you should see just as many stars as you did when you were younger.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stars are dead?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  All the stars you can see in the night sky are within a few hundred light-years of Earth. That means that you're seeing them as they were no more than a few hundred years ago. Most stars live for <em>billions</em> of years; the Sun, for example, is about 5 billion years old and is expected to live for another 5 billion or so years in essentially its current form. Some of the brighter stars have shorter lifespans (because they're larger and ""burn"" their nuclear fuel more quickly), but even they have lifespans of at least millions of years.</p>

<p>No naked-eye visible stars have ""died"" in the last several centuries. We do sometimes see stars explode (as novas or, more rarely, as supernovas), but I don't believe any of the stars that have done this were naked-eye visible before they exploded.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Current position of the earth in galaxy</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  The stars do move relative to each other, but not quickly enough for the motion to be visible over a human lifetime. Barnard's Star has the fastest proper motion of any star in the sky, but it only moves at about 10 arcseconds per year; it would take it nearly 2 centuries to move the width of a full Moon. And Barnard's star isn't even naked-eye visible. The stars you see in the night sky are in very nearly the same apparent positions as they were thousands of years ago.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some astronomers believe that one reason Earth is habitable is that the gravity of Jupiter does help protect us from some comets. Long-period comets, in particular, enter the solar system from its outer reaches. Jupiter’s gravity is thought to sling most of these fast-moving ice balls out of the solar system before they can get close to Earth. So long-period comets are thought to strike Earth only on very long timescales of millions or tens of millions of years. Without Jupiter nearby, long-period comets would collide with our planet much more frequently.</p>

<p>Intuitively speaking, it would seem to me that while any massive body in the Solar System would deflect the trajectories of some comets/asteroids that would otherwise pose a threat to Earth, it also must be true that some few ones that were <em>not</em> in a collision course would then be directed to us after having their trajectories deflected. Why isn't that the case?</p>
","<p>Wordy answer, mostly light on Math: </p>

<p>The key word here (and the article uses this word) is ""long period comets"".  </p>

<p>First there's Jupiter impacts, but that's a relatively low percentage, cause even large Jupiter is quite small compared to it's orbit.  Even if you extend it out to it's Roche limit where a comet could break apart, it's still a very small target in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>But any comet that passes near Jupiter (but doesn't hit it, get captured by it or broken apart in it's Roche limit) gets it's orbit changed somewhat by <a href=""http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/grav/primer.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gravity assist.</a>  Jupiter's high mass and relatively high orbital velocity make it the gravity assist king of the solar-system.</p>

<p>The closer the pass to Jupiter, the bigger the change.  Gravity assists, change both direction and velocity.  They can't change only one.  It's safe to assume that half of those gravity assists add velocity to the comet and half reduce velocity.   Very loosely speaking, the direction of the comet affects it's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion_and_aphelion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Perihelion</a> and it's velocity and any change in it's velocity affect's it's semi-major axis (explained a bit below).</p>

<p>The comet's orbital velocity is obviously dependent on how close the comet is to the sun.   (Kepler's law about equal areas over equal times), but any orbiting object also has an average velocity, which is closely tied to the semi-major axis and orbital period, and it's this average velocity and the velocity at Aphelion (it's slowest velocity) that matters for this discussion.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kepler.html#c6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">orbital period</a> of any object orbiting the sun is directly proportional to the 3rd power of the semi-major axis.  The average velocity is very closely correlated to the 1.5th power of the distance between the semi-major axis and the Sun.  </p>

<p>When you get comets with orbital periods of hundreds or thousands of years, their average orbital velocity, is relatively slow for a celestial object.  Pluto's average orbital velocity is about 4.67 km/s and it's minimum velocity at Aphelion is 3.71 km/s.  <a href=""http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/plutofact.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>.</p>

<p>For longer orbital periods the orbital velocity drops, roughly by the square root of the relative distance, so a comet with an orbital period of 1,000 years (about 4 times Pluto's), would have an orbital velocity about 1/2 as much and a velocity at Aphelion of maybe 1.8 km/s or a bit less.</p>

<p><a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vesc.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Escape Velocity</a> for the comet requires just a 41.4% increase on Aphelion orbital velocity, so, with our 1.8 km/s orbital velocity long period comet at Aphelion, if Jupiter gives that comet a push of just about .75 km/s, that would be enough to push that comet out of orbit, where it escapes the solar system.</p>

<p>So, while it might seem logical that Jupiter could send a comet equally towards earth as away from Earth, the relatively small push that a long period comet needs to escape the solar system, makes that a far more likely scenario than a nearly perfect 100 foot put into the Earth's orbit.   The odds of a long period comet being thrown out of the solar system by Jupiter is relatively high, especially with multiple passes, where, hitting Earth is like hitting a 100 foot put blindfolded.   Earth is a small target.  Out of the solar-system is a large target.</p>

<p>For shorter period comets where the added velocity needed to escape the solar system is greater, this grows proportionately less true, but for long period comets which only need a small push to get thrown out of the solar-system, statistically, Jupiter tosses a lot more of those out than it sends towards earth.   </p>

<p>The trick is to be very specific about what we're talking about.   If Jupiter was, for example, to migrate through the asteroid belt, or migrate outwards through the Kuiper belt, then it's size would send a lot of stuff in towards the inner solar-system.   It's not in and of itself, always going to protect Earth and reduce Earth-impacts.  It depends on where it is and what the orbits of the comets are, but specifically for long period comets, Jupiter is a-lot more likely to send them out of the solar-system than towards Earth.  Not all, just statistically more likely.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that there's a lot we don't know about the oort cloud and how many comets/icy objects are in it.   We don't know what percentage of long period comets are jupiter-crossers vs objects with more distant perihelions.   When a star or large rogue planet passes through Earth's Oort cloud, it can send some of the icy objects out there in towards the Earth.   (Planet 9 - if it exists, probably not so much, as that theoretical planet has probably already mostly cleared out it's orbit), so it's not a key player in sending stuff to the inner solar-systems, but a massive passing object that pass through the oort cloud can do that, at least, that's been theorized, though such events are quite uncommon because space is mostly empty.   When those rare events happens, then there's probably an increase in long period comets and when that happens, Jupiter, for the reasons described above, is pretty good at getting rid of them over time.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.space.com/28611-star-flew-through-solar-system.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scholz's star</a> is thought to have passed within 0.8 light years of our sun some 70,000 years ago and such a pass might be close enough to send a lot of Oort cloud objects in towards the inner solar system (though 0.8 light years it's still a bit far, as the oort cloud is probably quite empty that far out.  For a really good number of new long-period inner solar-system comets you'd probably want a 0.1 lightyear pass, or closer . . . . but massive objects passing that close are extremely rare, and . . .  I digress).   </p>

<p>But Scholz's star might have turned a number of Oort cloud objects into long-period comets that pass through the inner solar-system.  (We won't know for a long time, as it'll be perhaps a million years for those new comets to reach us), But assuming Scholz did that, any oort cloud objects entering the inner solar-system from that event would be extremely long period objects and Jupiter would be pretty good at (over time, it wouldn't happen quickly), but over multiple long period orbits which probably takes millions of years, Jupiter would be pretty good at removing most of those from the inner solar-system, but just by chance, it would probably send a few in Earth's direction too.   If there was no Jupiter, it would take a lot longer for those long period comets to get cleared out, so in that sense, it really does protect the Earth from Long period comets.   There would be a lot more of them if not for Jupiter (and to a lesser extent, Saturn) and more comets would mean more Earth impacts.</p>

"Is there a upper limit to the number of planets orbiting a star?","1531","","<p>Our sun has 8 planets orbiting as well as a number of dwarf planets. Are there any calculations that hint as to whether this number is close to some theoretical maximum value or are we simply an average solar system in this particular way? </p>

<p>I could imagine that if you have many planets, they will likely interact with each other. Can you calculate any theoretical value for the maximum number of planets which have long-term stable orbits around their own star? </p>
","<p>There do exist somewhat trivial configurations, which are stable in the long term and which include arbitrarily many bodies. Consider, for example, a set of $N$ circularly moving bodies of the same mass $m$, which obeys the constraint $mN\ll M$, where $M$ is the mass of the star. So long as $mN\ll M$, the bodies move dominantly in the gravitational field of the star and are hence moving stably over long term period. However, as $N$ is arbitrary, one concludes that there is no upper limit on the number of planets, provided that their total mass is small.</p>

<p>A more physical example would be a protoplanetary disc, or an accretion disc, which is a limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ of an arbitrary planetary system (not not necessarily circular) of a given mass. A yet more physical example is an asteroid belt, consisting of a large number of bodies on, roughly, stable orbits. Finally, during planet formation process the star goes through stages, when it is surrounded by sets of pebbles and asteroids, which keep their structure constant over a large number of orbits (roughly, of order $10^5$). And these all are real physical examples of planetary-like systems.</p>

<p>The answer to your question would start to alter, though, if you start imposing additional conditions apart from $N\rightarrow \infty$. For example, if you require that bodies do not collide in the long term, some of the above named systems would not work (for example, accretion disc model), but some other would (sets of concentric particles). If you additionally require that the object should obey the definition of a planet, that is have some range of masses, then interesting things will start happening when the total mass of the planets will start being comparable to the mass of the star. So the limit would certainly exist. Finally, you might be more strict about what do you really mean by stability here, and that could also have a bearing on the answer.</p>

<p><strong>To summarize, unless you impose any constraints, there do exist N-body systems orbiting a star in a stable fashion and having arbitrarily large $N$.</strong></p>

"Why is the Moon receding from the Earth due to tides? Is this typical for other moons?","1528","","<p>After reading the Q&amp;A <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/131/is-the-moon-moving-further-away-from-earth-and-closer-to-the-sun-why"">Is the moon moving further away from Earth and closer to the Sun? Why?</a> about the tides transferring energy to the Moon and pushing it from Earth, I have a question:</p>

<p>How is that energy actually being transferred to the Moon? The creation of tides requires energy, so I would expect that this should take energy from the Moon, slow it and cause it to eventually fall back to the Earth. Why isn't that happening?</p>

<p>Finally, if this is the general mechanism, would other moons that orbit around planets with a liquid surface and causing tides, be receding from their parent planets?</p>
","<p>It's pretty simple, actually.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lFYWs.jpg"" alt=""tidal bulging""></p>

<p>The Moon creates tides. Due to tides, the water bulges out towards the Moon (and also on the opposite side).</p>

<p>But the Earth also rotates pretty fast (once a day), faster than the Moon orbits the Earth (once a month). There's friction between the rotating Earth, and the watery bulge created by tides. The rotation of the Earth ""wants"" to rotate the bulge faster.</p>

<p>In effect, the rotation of the Earth drags the tidal bulge forward - the bulge is always a bit ahead of the Moon. When the Moon is at meridian, the tide is already decreasing.</p>

<p>So there's a bit of extra watery mass on Earth, a little bit ahead of the Moon. This watery bulge interacts gravitationally with the Moon.</p>

<p>This has two effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>it slows down the rotation of the Earth, gradually sucking energy from it (the Moon pulls the bulge, and therefore the Earth, ""back"")</li>
<li>that energy is dumped into the Moon's orbital motion, effectively ""pulling"" it forward</li>
</ul>

<p>When you dump energy of motion into an orbiting body, it settles into a higher orbit - higher orbit means more energy. Therefore, the transfer of energy from Earth' spin to Moon's orbit gradually makes Moon's orbit larger and larger.</p>

<p>This only happens because the Earth is spinning faster than the Moon orbits it. If the Earth was tidally locked to the Moon (spinning exactly as fast as the Moon orbits it), then no transfer would happen. If the Earth was spinning slower than the Moon's orbit, then the transfer would be opposite (from Moon's orbital motion to Earth's spin).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Counterintuitively, a satellite with more energy actually moves slower, but in a higher orbit. The extra energy goes into raising the orbit, not into making its speed faster. Why this happens exactly is a whole 'nother discussion.</p>

N2 = floor((month + 9) / 12)
N3 = (1 + floor((year - 4 * floor(year / 4) + 2) / 3))

<p>Finally N supposedly refers to the day of the year.</p>

<p>What do the magic numbers 275,9 etc represent in the equation ?</p>
","<p>This would really be better off in Stackoverflow, or another page.  Presumably, you assumed some of the calculations rely on concepts in Astronomy, which as far as I can tell having gone through them, they do not with the exception of the concept of leap years; which I think is general enough that it doesn't really mandate being in Astronomy.  Regardless:</p>

<p>The equation is a little abstract, so probably the easiest way to understand it would be through understanding each bit of data. Let's start with N2, I'll come back to N1:</p>

<pre><code>N2 = floor((month + 9) / 12)
</code></pre>

<p>N2 will equal 0 if month is less than 3, and will equal 1 if it is greater.  This formula is to determine whether February has passed.</p>

<pre><code>N3 = (1 + floor((year - 4 * floor(year / 4) + 2) / 3))
</code></pre>

<p>N3 will be equal to 2 if the year is not a leap year, and will be equal to 1 if it is a leap year. The math here is just to determine whether the current year happens to be a leap year.</p>

<pre><code>N = N1 - (N2 * N3) + day - 30
</code></pre>

<p>Now we take N1 (which I haven't covered yet) and we subtract it by the product of N2 and N3, which will equal 0 if we haven't reached March, or if we have it will be 1 on a leap year, and 2 on a non-leap year. We then add the number of the current day of the month, and subtract 30.  So what does N1 do?</p>

<pre><code>N1 = floor(275 * month / 9)
</code></pre>

<p>Well, lets look at the values returned compared to days in a non-leap year:</p>

<pre><code>Month     N1         Day       Diff
1.        30         31          -1
2.        61         59          +2
3.        91         90          +1
4.        122        120         +2
5.        152        151         +1
6.        183        181         +2
7.        213        212         +1
8.        244        243         +1

12.       366        365         +1
</code></pre>

<p>A bit messy, right?  Now, remember that you're subtracting 30 from the total at the end to get N, and we're adding in the current date. This means that although we multiply our current month to get N1, we're actually using this to calculate the dates from the months <em>prior</em> to our current month! Thus if we take the value of N1, subtract it by 30, and compare it to the preceding month, the chart will come out like this:</p>

<pre><code>Month     N1         Day       Diff
1.        31         31           0
2.        61         59          +2
3.        92         90          +2
4.        122        120         +2

</code></pre>

<p>From this, you can see that the value of N1 will equal 2 greater than the actual date for any day in which it is March or later.  This is perfect, as N2 is already a formula determining this for catching leap days. Note, these would all equal +1 on a leap year, as in another day would have been added in February. Thus coming back to the final calculation:</p>

<pre><code>N = N1 - (N2 * N3) + day - 30
</code></pre>

<p>We take <code>N1</code> and subtract in by the value of <code>(N2 * N3)</code>, which will be 2 on a non-leap year if February has passed, 1 on a leap year, or 0 if we haven't passed February.  We add in the days in the current month, and we subtract 30 to get the offset in <code>N1</code> values.</p>

<p>This should consistently give you the day of the year.  As for special significance, they're being used only for mathematical properties. Dividing a number between 1 and 12 by 9, just so happens to equal less than 1 for numbers less than 3, and greater than or equal to 1 and less than 2 all the way up to 12, which is why it is we have started March. The <code>275 * (month / 9)</code> formula I'm not sure where they came up with.

"Why is it said that the far side of the moon's crust is thicker?","1512","","<p>This <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJkVegBsNyE"" rel=""noreferrer"">video</a> states that NASA has determined that the far side of the moon's crust is thicker than the near side's crust. How did they determine this?</p>

<p>Please note I'm not asking for theories or hypotheses on how this came to be, but rather if the difference in thickness indeed is measurable scientifically today.</p>

<p><em>[So off-topic: If it is in fact true, I favour the theory that the centrifugal force of the earth's gravity along with the fact that the far side is always pointing outwards, is responsible for this and not some other moon smashing into our moon etc. as is shown in that video.]</em></p>
","<p>The near side and far side have very different topography. Compared to the near side, the far side is far more rugged and has far fewer maria. The near side in places has very thin crust (the maria).</p>

<p>Other than these surface features, the biggest indicator of a disparity in crustal thickness is the two kilometer offset between the Moon's center of figure and it's center of mass. This is typically attributed to a thicker crust on the far side of the Moon, consistent with the observations of the different surfaces of the near side and far side.</p>

<p>NASA discovered that the center of figure (geometrical center) and the center of mass are offset from one another in the late 1960s. The simple act of observing how a probe orbits an object gives clues regarding the interior of that object. Scientists know, for example, that Mars has a partially molten core from observing the orbits of the many probes that have been sent to Mars.</p>

<p>In the case of the Moon, NASA sent 16 unmanned probes to the Moon in the 1960s prior to the Apollo 8 mission. The first four of these, Ranger 6, 7, 8, and 9, were impactors. Their impacts the Moon indicated the Moon's center of mass was displaced from its center of figure by 2-3 kilometers. Later missions confirmed this, and also confirmed that the Moon's near side has five large mass concentrations (""mascons"").  The Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions carried laser altimeters that gave very precise measurements of the distance to the Moon's surface. These further improved the estimate of the Moon's center of figure / center of mass offset.</p>

"Why can't we observe the Oort cloud with a telescope?","1502","","<p>The Oort cloud is a hypothetical structure based on our observation of long-period comets. There are currently proposals to design probes to confirm the existence of the Oort cloud.</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Kuiper_oort.jpg"" alt=""Oort cloud""></p>

<p>Now, sending a probe would have other benefits, but why can't we observe the Oort cloud with a telescope?</p>
","<p>The angular resolution of the telescope <em>really has no direct bearing on our ability to detect Oort cloud objects</em> beyond how that angular resolution affects the depth to which one can detect the light from faint objects. Any telescope can detect stars, even though their actual discs are way beyond the angular resolution of the telescope.</p>

<p>The detection of Oort cloud objects is simply a question of detecting the (unresolved) reflected light in exactly the same way that one detects a faint (unresolved) star. Confirmation of the Oort cloud nature of the object would then come by observing at intervals over a year or so and obtaining a very large ($&gt;2$ arcseconds) parallax.</p>

<p>The question amounts to how deep do you need to go? We can do this in two ways (i) a back of the envelope calculation assuming the object reflects light from the Sun with some albedo. (ii) Scale the brightness of comets when they are distant from the Sun.</p>

<p>(i) The luminosity of the Sun is $L=3.83\times10^{26}\ W$. Let the distance to the Oort cloud be $D$ and the radius of the (assumed spherical) Oort object be $R$.
The light from the Sun incident on the object is $\pi R^2 L/4\pi D^2$.
If we now assume that a fraction $f$ of this is reflected uniformly into a $2\pi$ solid angle. This latter point is an approximation, the light will not be reflected isotropically, but it will represent some average over any viewing angle.</p>

<p>To a good approximation, as $D \gg 1$ au, we can assume that the distance from the Oort object to the Earth is also $D$. Hence the flux of light received at the Earth is
$$F_{E} = f \frac{\pi R^2 L}{4\pi D^2}\frac{1}{2\pi D^2} = f \frac{R^2 L}{8\pi D^4}$$</p>

<p>Putting some numbers in, let $R=10$ km and let $D= 10,000$ au. Cometary material has a very low albedo, but let's be generous and assume $f=0.1$.
$$ F_E = 3\times10^{-29}\left(\frac{f}{0.1}\right) \left(\frac{R}{10\ km}\right)^2 \left(\frac{D}{10^4 au}\right)^{-4}\ Wm^{-2}$$</p>

<p>To convert this to a magnitude, assume the reflected light has the same spectrum as sunlight. The Sun has an apparent visual magnitude of -26.74, corresponding to a flux at the Earth of $1.4\times10^{3}\ Wm^{-2}$. Converting the flux ratio to a magnitude difference, we find that the apparent magnitude of our fiducial Oort object is <strong>52.4</strong>.</p>

<p>(ii) Halley's comet is similar (10 km radius, low albedo) to the fiducial Oort object considered above. Halley's comet was observed by the <a href=""http://www.eso.org/~ohainaut/nice/phot-27-03.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">VLT in 2003</a> with a magnitude of 28.2 and at a distance of 28 au from the Sun. We can now just scale this magnitude, but it scales as distance to the power of <em>four</em>, because the light must be received and then we see it reflected.
Thus at 10,000 au, Halley would have a magnitude of $28.2 - 2.5 \log (28/10^{4})= 53.7$, in reasonable agreement with my other estimate. (Incidentally my crude formula in (i) above suggests a $f=0.1$, $R=10\ km$ comet at 28 au would have a magnitude of 26.9. Given that Halley probably has a smaller $f$ this is excellent consistency.)</p>

<p>The observation of Halley by the VLT represents the pinnacle of what is possible with today's telescopes. Even the Hubble deep ultra deep field only reached visual magnitudes of about 29. Thus a big Oort cloud object remains <strong>more than 20 magnitudes below</strong> this detection threshold!</p>

<p>The most feasible way of detecting Oort objects is when they occult background stars. The possibilities for this are discussed by <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0948"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ofek &amp; Naker 2010</a> in the context of the photometric precision provided by Kepler. The rate of occultations (which are of course single events and unrepeatable) was calculated to be between zero and 100 in the whole Kepler mission, dependent on the size and distance distribution of the Oort objects. As far as I am aware, nothing has come of this (yet).</p>

","<p>One way to answer would be to consider the brightest star in our sky (other than the Sun), which is Sirius.  Then determine how far you would have to be from our Sun for it to be as bright as Sirius is from here.</p>

<p>That turns out to be 1.8 light years.  That's not even halfway to the nearest star, so if you're in any other star system, then our Sun is just another star.  If you're anywhere in our solar system, even way out in the Oort cloud, then our Sun is way brighter than anything else.</p>

<p>1) The disks of galaxies like the Milky Way are a few 10's of kpc (that's pronounced kiloparsecs, which are 1000's of parsecs) in size. The dark matter halos surrounding them extend out to almost an order of magnitude further.</p>

People are often disappointed when shown a nebula through a telescope.

"Is it possible to break apart a neutron star?","1481","","<p>I was inspired by <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/143166/what-is-the-theoretical-lower-mass-limit-for-a-gravitationally-stable-neutron-st"">this question</a> on Physics, as well as <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/2533/can-we-theoretically-spin-the-black-hole-so-strong-that-it-will-be-broken-apar"">this question</a> right here on Astronomy. Neutron stars are tightly bound together as neutron degenerate matter. They're very massive and have a strong gravitational field. Is it possible to break one apart into sizable chunks? How would you do this?</p>

<hr>

<p>The answers given are good and answer my question; I'll just clarify some one thing (based on the comments) for posterity.</p>

<p>I would define ""broken"" as when any significant amount of mass is removed from the neutron star, as in mass shedding, as <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/7778/is-it-possible-to-break-apart-a-neutron-star/7802#7802"">Mitch Goshorn wrote</a>. The resulting object, however, should contain a significant amount of neutron matter - that is, it should largely retain its prior composition.</p>
","<p>It would appear theoretically possible (to some degree) through extreme applications of recycling to trigger mass shedding in pulsars.</p>

<p>Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars, the fastest class of which are millisecond pulsars. The current belief is that they build up rotational speed through accretion, a process known as <strong>recycling</strong>. One study, <a href=""http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1994ApJ...423L.117C&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Recycling Pulsars to Millisecond Periods in General Relativity</a> (Cook, et al), explores the limitations of this process.</p>

<p>The following chart shows their results:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EUr4Q.png"" alt=""Plot of gravitational mass to central energy density""></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the point where the dotted lines meet the two plots, you can see a reduction in mass at those energy levels. This is due to the angular velocity of the body creating instability which results in <strong>mass shedding</strong> - essentially mass at the equator of our neutron star being flung off the star due to the body's angular velocity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not exactly an easy process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The timescale to accrete the required rest mass, ~0.1 <em>M</em><sub>☉</sub>, at the Eddington limit, ~10<sup>-8</sup> <em>M</em><sub>☉</sub>yr<sup>-1</sup>, is ~10<sup>7</sup> yr. This timescale is largely insensitive to the adopted nuclear equation of state. If other astrophysical considerations require a considerably shorter time scale, then the simple recycling scenario described here will have to be modified beyond the variations explored in this paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(Note however that the research here is actually attempting to avoid such instabilities, and they accomplish this by adding even more mass, such that the body can support even greater rotational velocity without encounter instability. Additionally, they're trying to create millisecond pulsars, but we don't need to do this as they exist naturally, so we could save ourselves a lot of time by (very carefully) approaching an existing millisecond pulsar</em>)</p>

<p>I don't think this would exactly be <em>breaking apart</em> (despite <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond_pulsar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia's</a> use of that exact verbiage to describe it), but it allows for the return of mass that was at one point in a neutron star.  Of course, chances are our theoretical neutron star miners are very likely to be the ones who put that mass on the neutron star to begin with. On the other hand, this (hopefully) accomplishes the task without reducing the object to a quark star or black hole.</p>

<p>Note the line about using a leafy tree as a filter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scientists say NOT to directly look at the sun (if skies are clearing where you are), but looking at the eclipse through a leafy tree creates a natural filter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've heard a lot of people recommend viewing a solar eclipse by looking at the projection of the eclipse caused by light passing between leaves in a tree, in this case looking at the ground or a wall, where ever the light hits after passing through the tree.  However, the Facebook posting here seems to recommend looking up at the solar eclipse <em>through</em> the tree.</p>

<p>I suspect that they have misunderstood the projection method (or inadequately explained), and their advice is not only wrong, but potentially dangerous.</p>

<p>Is this method recommendable? Should it be considered dangerous?</p>

<h2>Follow-up</h2>

<p>Almost immediately upon having seen the posting I had commented on it noting my belief that such advice could be dangerous, including a more clear explanation of how viewing using trees should be done. The staff member who originally posted the status later took note of this and edited the status to less ambiguously explain viewing the projection. Unfortunately, this was done <em>after</em> the solar eclipse had concluded. Hopefully no damage was done.</p>
","<p>It seems that the station has, in fact, given out extremely dangerous advice - simply because it was poorly phrased.</p>

<p>Viewing a solar eclipse is incredibly dangerous - mostly under circumstances where you're looking towards the Sun. As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse#Viewing"">Wikipedia</a> warns,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking directly at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even for just a few seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You couldn't pay me enough to so much as face toward the Sun and look at my feet and attempt to view a solar eclipse out of the corner of my eye!</p>

<p>There are safe ways to view an eclipse, the most common being using a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera"">pinhole camera</a> to indirectly view the eclipse. Not only are you not looking directly at the Sun, but you can actually turn away and look at the projection.</p>

<p>But here's where I think the station messed up. According to <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/22/tech/innovation/partial-solar-eclipse/index.html"">CNN</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or let a tree do the work for you. ""Overlapping leaves create a myriad of natural little pinhole cameras, each one casting an image of the crescent-sun onto the ground beneath the canopy,"" NASA says.</p>

<p>So NASA actually advocates using the leaves as a pinhole and using indirect viewing methods - i.e. looking anywhere <em>but</em> the Sun - as opposed to watching the eclipse <em>through</em> the leaves.</p>

"How do I remove fungus from a telescope mirror?","1478","","<p>I use a Celestron NexStar 130SLT Azimuthal Newtonian Reflector. I noticed that recently, due to the wet season, some tiny spots of what appears to be fungus have appeared. </p>

<p>Having taking appropriate precautions to prevent the same in future, how can I presently get rid of these fungi colonies on my primary reflector?</p>
","<p>Several points need to be made.</p>

<p><strong>1. Performance</strong></p>

<p>The performance of the whole optical stack is incredibly resilient w.r.t. small spots on the primary mirror. The mirror might look visually very, very dirty, but the performance of the whole instrument will remain essentially the same. Even if you chip the mirror at the edge, it shouldn't matter. Take a marker and scribble a dozen lines on the mirror - it doesn't make a large difference for performance, not greater anyway than what the 4 vanes of the secondary mirror already do (we can start a separate discussion about diffraction artifacts from spots and lines on the mirror - but the bottom line is, don't worry about it).</p>

<p>With that in mind, you should be conservative when deciding to clean the mirror. Let it accumulate some amount of dirt, the scope will be okay.</p>

<p><strong>2. Permanent damage</strong></p>

<p>That being said, mold or other living things may chemically corrode the mirror. Again, a few spots of corrosion do not impact performance, but you don't want to allow this process to continue.</p>

<p>Dust will generally not corrode the mirror. Salt (from ocean breeze) will usually corrode it in time. With mold it's hard to say, but it's best if it's removed.</p>

<p><strong>3. Prevention</strong></p>

<p>Mold grows because the mirror is wet. The mirror fogs up usually when you bring the scope back into a warm room from outside; the mirror is cold, and water in the warm air condenses on it.</p>

<p>Procure a cheap, small fan, and point it at the rear end of the scope while it's warming up after you bring it back in. The air current will reduce water condensation on the mirror. Turn the fan off after 30 ... 60 minutes.</p>

<p>Also, keep the OTA (the big tube of the telescope) capped off while not in use. This will reduce dust deposits, and therefore mold will find less food to grow. At least cap off the top end and store the scope in a vertical position; that will reduce dust deposits greatly. The bottom end is less important.</p>

<p>Avoid storing the scope in a place with large day/night temperature variations. When the mirror is colder than air, condensation may form. This can happen spontaneously with scopes stored in a shed outside. The mirror fogs up in the morning, when air is getting warmer but the scope is still cold. This is much less of an issue with small scopes, but it's something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>You could cap off both ends while in storage, and place a bag of silica gel inside the OTA (don't drop it on the mirror). That will suck up all humidity inside the OTA, but you have to bake the silica gel in the oven every so often to keep it working effectively. You could buy silica gel online, it's very cheap. Avoid temperature variations and the gel is not necessary.</p>

<p><strong>4. Clean up procedure</strong></p>

<p>This is the procedure recommended by Optic Wave Labs:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y8xFnXFVGQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y8xFnXFVGQ</a></p>

<p>I make mirrors but I don't coat them myself (yet) - however, I've found that procedure to work very well on both coated and non-coated glass.</p>

<p>A few minutes of initial soaking in water makes everything easier later on.</p>

<p>After soaking it, add a few drops of detergent and rub very gently with your clean fingertips or with a soft, clean, lint-free cloth. Don't put pressure on the mirror, just try to detach the dirt from mirror in the horizontal direction and let it wash off. Don't drag dust particles across the glass, just detach them and let them go; this is why fingers are better than cloth - because you can feel large particles coming off.</p>

<p>When done, wash off the detergent with lots and lots and lots of water.</p>

<p>Using tap water for most of the cleaning procedure is absolutely fine. If you can drink the water, it's fine for the mirror too. Don't use hot water if the mirror is cold, there's a very small chance of cracking it, especially with cheap, mass produced glass.</p>

<p>When you're done cleaning, rinse the mirror with distilled water. Again, a few water spots on the mirror don't matter to performance, but the mirror looks better if it's spot-free. Tap water tends to leave water spots if you don't follow up with distilled water rinsing, and most people find the spots not pleasing from an esthetic perspective (but performance is same). So just splash a bottle of distilled water on it at the end and you'll be fine. No touching after rinsing.</p>

<p>Some dirt or mold may not be removed by the usual water-based procedure. In that case, use isopropyl alcohol, the highest concentration you can find (over 90% is fine). Rub gently with your clean, non-greasy fingertips or a lint-free cloth. If it doesn't come off quickly, leave it alone. Alcohol has probably killed the mold anyway.</p>

<p>Acetone might be used for things that resist even alcohol. But again, you have to use your judgement: a few little spots won't affect performance, so is it worth the trouble?</p>

<p>In any case, rinse with distilled water at the end, then let it dry off in an inclined position (carefully to not tip the mirror over on its face). Put a towel on the table in front of the mirror, so if it does topple over, at least it falls on something soft. Do not let it dry in a horizontal position, you'll get water spots and dust.</p>

<p>If there's some permanent damage in a few little spots, don't worry about it. The mirror will work essentially the same.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you do the water-based procedure every 1 or 2 years, depending on how dirty the mirror is. If dust contamination is moderate, leave it alone.</p>

<p><strong>5. Post-cleanup</strong></p>

<p>After everything is done, re-collimate the telescope carefully. But this should go without saying, since collimation is part of the regular maintenance of newtonian telescopes.</p>

"Is there a gas giant orbiting TRAPPIST-1?","1474","","<p>I would like to know if besides <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1"" rel=""noreferrer"">these planets</a>, astronomers have discovered a gas planet like Jupiter in this system and if on these planets could exist life without a comet protector like Jupiter does for the Earth. </p>
","<p>No such planet has been announced as having been discovered. The paper only shows evidence for the 7 (really 6 because the 7th can't be officially confirmed with only 1 observation) terrestrial planets and does not make the case for any other planets. The paper doesn't indicate that more planets could exist, but does remark that there are large error bars on some of their data, leaving room for uncertainty.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think we can cross off a gas giant existing in this system for a few reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>We don't see transit timing variations due to a gas giant. A gas giant would have noticeable gravitational influences on the inner 7 planets and we would see this influence by the small variations in the orbital periods of the inner planets. The authors of the paper did see transit timing variations, but they were able to explain all of the variations as due to the gravitational influences of the 7 planets only. They never had to invoke an 8th unseen planet to explain what they say.</li>
<li>We don't observe such a (easily-detectable) transit. There are only two reasons we wouldn't see the transit of this planet. Either the gas giant is orbiting in a different plane than the rest of the planets (which are all remarkably close to the same plane, as pointed out by the authors), or else the orbital period is so long, it was never captured by any of the previous observations (which spans a number of years). Neither situation seems likely to occur.</li>
<li>The mass of the central star is only 8% of the Sun's mass. Smaller stars tend to form smaller planets. Its really hard for gas giants to form around small stars, primarily due to lack of material. From what we understand about planet formation, the chances of a gas giant even being able to form around this star is pretty small.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, only continued observation will really be able to convince us that a gas giant doesn't exist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On these planets could exist life without a comet protector like Jupiter does for the Earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great question. I think the answer is, we can't be sure. Jupiter does do a great job shepherding comets and protecting the Earth. Possibly this system is rife with comets that constantly bombard the planets. However, that's just one small part of the puzzle. Our Moon does a phenomenal job in protecting us as well.</p>

<p>I think, when it comes to these planets, your primary concern for whether life can exist or not is the central star. It is a low-mass, ultra-cool dwarf star. These stars tend to be very volatile, much more so than our generally quiescent Sun. This means these planets are likely to receive much more radiation and be hit by many more solar storms than we are. Furthermore, these planets are so close to TRAPPIST-1 that they're all tidally locked - one face is always towards the star and one is always away. This could make one side inhospitably hot and the other inhospitably cold. The climate/weather on such a planet would likely be unsuitable for life (but who knows for sure). The tidal locking could potentially be good though as it means only the outward-facing side would generally be hit by comets, thus protecting any life on the Sun facing side (assuming its not too hot on that side).</p>

"Gravitation - Pulling or Pushing force?","1467","","<p>According to Newton, gravity is the pulling - or in fact the attracting - force of any heavenly body towards any object to its center. But, to the contrary, Einstein once said that the four dimensions of space and time push the object downwards.</p>

<p>So can which one of them is correct?</p>
","<p>In general relativity, gravity neither pushes nor pulls. To explain why ball travels in an arc you note the start and end points of the throw in 4d space time (3 space co-ordinates and 1 time coordinate) You then find the shortest path between these two 4d points in the curved spacetime surrounding the Earth. This shortest path is the path in spacetime that the ball travels. </p>

<p>So in General relativity, gravity is not seen as being a force, instead it is the result objects travelling in the most direct way in a region of curved spacetime. </p>

"Why do comets appear to have a continuous supply of dust?","1464","","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet"">Comets</a> orbiting the sun have a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet#Tails""><em>tail</em></a> that points away from the Sun, due to the solar wind. </p>

<p>(Strictly speaking, a comet can have both a type I tail - ion tail, and a type II tail - a dust tail. This question is about the type II tail - the dust tail). </p>

<p>Now I understand that some of the source of the dust is volatile materials in the comet oxidising due to the comet's proximity to the sun. But surely some of these comets have been orbiting for hundreds of thousands of years (if not millions). Why do they still have unspent fuel? Why are they still dusty? Hasn't all the dust blown off by now?</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>Why do comets appear to have a continuous supply of dust?</strong></p>
","<p>The rate of loss of mass from a comet is perhaps surprisingly low. A paper <a href=""http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/alllpl/AfrPaperPubl.pdf"">The calculation of $Af\rho$ and mass loss rate for comets</a> gives a rate for a ""typical"" comet at 1.29AU as 153kg/s.

<p>In fact comets are only active when the are near perihelion, and they are only near perihelion for a small fraction of their orbit. Put it together and you have the potential for an active life of hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, comets do run out of volatile substances, at which point they become inactive, and appear as small dark asteroids.

"death of a red dwarf star / minimum mass needed for a white dwarf?","1460","","<p>OK, first, I know there's a variety of sizes and types of red dwarf stars and the universe is too young for any of them to have reached the end of their main sequence phase yet, so it's all theoretical and/or modeling.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf</a></p>

<p>But what is the theoretical size needed for a star to undergo the electron degeneracy process which turns a small star from at least Jupiter sized, usually bigger, into to earth sized super dense object, where, as I understand it, the electrons are squeezed off the nuclei - electron degeneracy.  </p>

<p>It would seem to me that a 7.5% solar mass star, which gradually burns hydrogen into helium but doesn't burn helium, might not have the mass to compact into a true white dwarf but might end it's life looking more like a brown dwarf / super Jupiter - well, talking appearance, not really, cause super Jupiter &amp; Brown dwarfs are mostly hydrogen while and an end of life red dwarf should be mostly helium - which, in and of itself, might make the difference.</p>

<p>It's just my curiosity whether all red dwarfs turn into white dwarfs at the end of their burning phase or is there a theoretical mass that's needed for that level of shrinkage to occur?   </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>Stars that have a mass lower than about $0.5 M_{\odot}$ will not ignite helium in their cores, in an analogous fashion to the way that stars with $M&lt;8M_{\odot}$ have insufficiently massive cores that never reach high enough temperatures to ignite carbon.</p>

<p>The cause in both cases is the onset of electron degeneracy pressure, which is independent of temperature and allows the core to cool at constant pressure and radius. [A normal gas would contract and become hotter as it loses energy!]</p>

<p>The end result for a $0.5M_{\odot}$ star will be a helium white dwarf with a mass (depending on uncertain details of the mass-loss process) of around $0.2M_{\odot}$. Such things do exist in nature now, but only because they have undergone some kind of mass transfer event in a binary system that has accelerated their evolution. The collapse to a degenerate state would be <strong>inevitable</strong> even for the lowest mass stars (which would of course then be very low-mass white dwarfs). As an inert core contracts it loses heat and cools - a higher density and lower temperate eventually lead to degenerate conditions that allow the core to cool without losing pressure.</p>

<p>The lowest mass stars ($&lt;0.3 M_{\odot}$) do get there via a slightly different route - they are fully convective, so the ""core"" doesn't exist really, it is always mixed with the envelope. They do not develop into red giants and thus I guess will suffer much less mass loss.</p>

<p>The remnant <em>would</em> be a white dwarf in either case and is fundamentally different from a brown dwarf both in terms of size and structure, because it would be made of helium rather than (mostly) hydrogen. This should have an effect in two ways. For the same mass, the brown dwarf should end up bigger because the number of mass units per electron is smaller (1 vs 2) and also because the effects of a finite temperature are larger in material with fewer mass units per particle - i.e. its outer, non-degenerate layer would be more ""puffed up"". NB: The brown dwarfs we see today are Jupiter-sized, but are still cooling. They will get a bit smaller and more degenerate.</p>

<p>A simple size calculation could use the approximation of an ideal, cold, degenerate gas. A bit of simple physics using the virial theorem gives you
$$ \left(\frac{R}{R_{\odot}}\right) \simeq 0.013\left(\frac{\mu_e}{2}\right)^{-5/3} \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{-1/3},$$
where $\mu_e$ is the number of atomic mass units per electron.
Putting in appropriate numbers I get $0.32\ R_{Jup}$ for a $0.07M_{\odot}$ Helium white dwarf versus $1.01\ R_{Jup}$ for a $0.07M_{\odot}$ completely degenerate Hydrogen brown dwarf (in practice it would be a bit smaller because it isn't all hydrogen).</p>

<p>However, it would be interesting to see some realistic calculations of what happens to a $0.07M_{\odot}$ brown dwarf versus a $0.08M_{\odot}$ star in a trillion years or so. I will update the answer if I come across such a study.</p>

<p>EDIT: I knew I'd seen something on this. Check out <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...482..420L"" rel=""nofollow"">Laughlin et al. (1997)</a>, which studies the long-term evolution of very low-mass stars. Low-mass stars do not pass through a red giant phase, remain fully convective and can thus convert almost all their hydrogen into helium over the course of $10^{13}$ years and end up cooling as degenerate He white dwarfs.</p>

"Escaping a black hole","1432","","<p>I often hear that nothing can escape a black hole because it's ""escape velocity"" is greater than <em>c</em>. If that is accurate, what about the following. I know that the following has a lot of most likely impossible assumptions, but I'm trying to understand whether the escape velocity explanation makes sense.</p>

<p>Suppose you've got some sort of space ship that's inside the event horizon, and it hasn't been destroyed by the gravity or tidal forces. Also suppose that you've got a whole lot of reaction mass and a fantastic power supply.</p>

<p>Could this space ship, through applying enough constant force escape the event horizon?</p>
","<p>One of the clearest way to see what's going on is to look at a Penrose diagram of a Schwarzschild black hole. A Penrose diagram is like a map of the spacetime drawn in such a way as to preserve angles and put the light rays diagonally at $45^\circ$ angles, forming the light cones.</p>

<p>Since we're mapping all of an infinite space(time) into a finite drawing, distances are necessarily distorted, but that's a small price to pay.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UwOxF.gif"" alt=""Schwarzschild causal diagram, original by Andrew Hamilton""></p>

<p>Time goes up on the diagram, and a typical infalling trajectory is in blue.</p>

<p>Because every massive object must be locally slower than light, it must stay within those light cones. Hence, no matter how you accelerate, at every point of your trajectory you must go in a direction that stays within those $45^\circ$ diagonals at that point. But once you're inside the horizon, every direction that stays within the light cones leads to the singularity.</p>

<p>Accelerating this way or that just means that you get to choose where you hit the singularity--a little on the left on the diagram or a little to the right. Trying to escape using high acceleration brings you closer to the light's $45^\circ$ lines, which because of time dilation will actually <em>shorten</em> your lifespan. You'll actually get to the singularity <em>sooner</em> if you struggle in that manner.</p>

"Is it possible that the Sun has a binary partner (the Nemesis Theory) that has eluded detection?","1422","","<p>I just recently learned about the theory that our Sun has a small companion star with a 26 million year orbit. This theory came about when it was realized that mass extinction events happened approximately every 26 million years. My question is not whether or not this is possible as that has been asked before; my question is how could we have missed it? </p>

<p>When we look for exoplanets in the Universe, we are sometimes able to detect a slight wobble in the parent stars. Along those lines, if the Sun had a companion star, how would we not notice the effects on its rotation/orbit? If the sun and this companion star were locked in a 26 million year orbit, would we be able to notice the orbit? </p>

<p>Finally, when you have a star system like ours, with so many planets, is it possible to tell which planet is causing which specific motion in the Sun? For example, let's say we traveled to a different star system a few hundred light years away, and we were studying our solar system. Would we be able to look at the way the Sun wobbles and determine how many planets were in orbit around our Sun, or would we only be able to say that there was one, or simply that there may be several? I guess, the root question is how accurately can we judge the contents of a star system based on the perturbations in the star's orbit? Thank you kindly for your time. </p>
","<p>The first part of your question has been asked before:  <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/2531/is-sun-a-part-of-a-binary-system"">Is Sun a part of a binary system?</a> and the current (lack of) evidence for such a companion is discussed on the relevant <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_%28hypothetical_star%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia page</a> about ""Nemesis"".</p>

<p>To summarise: if it were a small companion star, or even a brown dwarf that had been cooling for 4.5 billion years <em>and</em> it had a 26 million year orbit, then Kepler's third law tells us how far away that object would be. It turns out that this is not far enough away that the object would have eluded detection in all-sky surveys. The recent WISE survey in the near-infrared should have been capable of detecting even a very cool brown dwarf (and indeed it has detected some very cool brown dwarfs, just not <em>that</em> close to the Sun - e.g. a 250K brown dwarf only 6 light years away <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...786L..18L"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Luhman et al. 2014</a>) that was close enough to the Sun to be a Nemesis candidate.</p>

<p>Since the details do not appear to be on the wikipedia page, I'll fill some in. If we take a very low mass brown dwarf - say 20 Jupiter masses - in a 26 million year orbit, then Kepler's 3rd law tells us this will be about 90,000 au (1.4 light years) from the Sun (assuming a circular orbit). According to the evolutionary models of <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...689.1327S"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Saumon &amp; Marley (2008)</a>, such an object has an intrinsic luminosity of $10^{-7}$ times (1 ten millionth) that of the Sun and a temperature of 400 Kelvin and would appear to have a spectral type of late T or early Y. </p>

<p>From the calibration of absolute magnitudes versus spectral type for cool brown dwarfs in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6977"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marsh et al. (2013)</a> we know that at 90,000 au, such a brown dwarf would have magnitudes of $H=14$ and $W2=8$. The former is bright enough to have been seen in the 2MASS all-sky survey and the latter is easily detected by WISE. The combination of data would also easily have revealed the large parallax of such an object. We can conclude that an object would have to have <em>much</em> lower mass than this to remain undetected.</p>

<p>Now the middle part of your question: A star will ""wobble"" in response to its companion with exactly the same period as the orbit. So, if you are prepared to wait for an appreciable fraction of 26 million years, then yes, the presence of the binary companion might be revealed in a net small oscillation of average proper motions over the whole sky, with a period of 26 million years! Otherwise not. Measuring the ""wobble"" by doppler methods is currently capable of detecting Jupiter-mass objects in orbital periods of 10-20 years. Measuring the wobble ""astrometrically""  - that is measuring the position displacement of the star due to an unseen companion is more sensitive to distant companions, but still, one is limited by the fact that the wobble period will be the same as the orbital period of the companion. An assessment of the performance of the Gaia astrometry satellite by <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1173"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Perryman et al. (2014)</a> suggests detection of planets with orbital periods out to 10 years might be possible.</p>

<p>For the final part of the question - yes, the motion/wobble of a star can be decomposed (using Fourier techniques) into components that are due to each planet. There are numerous examples of multiple planetary systems that have been discovered by the radial velocity technique in this manner. Similar techniques can and will be employed to analyse any astrometric wobble. An interesting plot is to show the motion of the Sun in the plane of our solar system, in the rest frame of the solar system centre of mass. The Sun executes a complicated trajectory in this plot due primarily to the influence of Jupiter (on an 11 year orbit), but with superimposed ""epicycles"" due to the influence of the smaller planets on different orbital periods. See below.</p>

","<p>Direct reflection of sunlight is the most likely scenario for a ninth planet discovery, however that does not hold if the object has a very low albedo. I assume you are interested in what wavelengths the planet would radiate.</p>

<p>For the surface temperature, the rotation of the planet is important. If it is locked with one side facing the sun, or rotates very slowly, the centre of the sun facing hemisphere radiates as much energy as it gets from the Sun. At 60 AU, the solar flux is about 0.38 W/m². Using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law"">Stefan-Boltzmann law</a>, we obtain a equilibrium surface temperature of 51 K (that is the highest possible surface temperature, assuming it does not have an atmosphere).
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien&#39;s_displacement_law"">Wien's displacement law</a> tells us that radiation from a 51 k object peaks at a wavelength of 57 µm (infra-red).</p>

<p>For a rotating body, the equator temperature is 38 K, with radiation peaking at 78 µm (still infra-red).</p>

<p>Using an albedo of 0.5, the peaks are 68 µm and 90 µm for a non-rotating and a rotating body respectively.
Note that this is for the equator region only, the actual peak-wavelength is going to be a little bit higher, belonging in the far infra-red spectrum. Also, the high uncertainty of rotation, albedo and mass (mass is important for internal heat), makes it impossible to get a higher accuracy than that</p>

<p>60 au is a very optimistic perihelion distance for the ninth planet, so for a more realistic distance of say 200 au, it is not possible to observe it in the IR spectrum, if it does not have a significant internal heat source.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can (and should) check these numbers against a reliable source, such as Stellarium or HORIZONS (<a href=""http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>These numbers are imperfect for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Like most planetarium programs, I neglect light travel
time (Stellarium neglects light travel time by default, but you
can change this in the settings). This is probably the largest
error in the numbers above.</p></li>
<li><p>NASA solves differential equations from known constants to
publish planetary positions. The constants aren't necessarily
accurate (they are updated occasionally), and NASA publishes only
approximations to the differential equations solutions. The
approximations are usually good within a few meters, but if the
constants were/are drastically different in the past/future
(and/or are erroneous), these results would not apply.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>My methodology:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I used the SPICE kernels
(<a href=""http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/kernel.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/kernel.html</a>)
to find the positions of Jupiter and Venus (in the ICRF J2000
frame) daily from 999 BCE to 2999 CE.</p></li>
<li><p>I assumed the position of Regulus was constant in the ICRF J2000
frame. Since ICRF J2000 is a non-precessing frame, this is
essentially accurate, but neglects Regulus' small proper motion.</p></li>
<li><p>I computed the daily maximal angular separation between Jupiter,
Venus, and Regulus.</p></li>
<li><p>I found local minima among the daily separations, and used the
ternary method to find the instant of the actual local minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>I looked at the separations for 2 BCE and 2015 CE, and filtered
the results to only show conjunctions with separations less than
the maximum of these two separations.</p></li>
<li><p>I computed the position of the Sun on the filtered list, and
included the separation between the Sun and the closest of the
Jupiter, Regulus, and Venus.</p></li>
<li><p>I did most of the work in Mathematica, but used the Unix program
j2d to convert Julian dates to calendar dates, because Mathematica
uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar, which most people do not
use.</p></li>
<li><p>You can see what I did (in extremely cluttered form) at:</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>I wanted to present the results in a sortable HTML table, but
stackexchange doesn't allow tables of any sort.</p></li>
<li><p>Here are Stellarium screenshots of some of these
conjunctions. Regulus is the light blue star, Venus is bright
yellow, and Jupiter is the one with the moons. The object I've
selected (if any) is not necessarily relevant to the conjunction.</p></li>

"How would Jupiter's brightness relative to our sun seem to a remote observer (observing from a remote star)","1415","","<p>Given that Jupiter is 5 AU from our sun and a remote observer viewing our solar system from some other part of our galaxy looks at it. We assume that Jupiter's radius is $11 \times 6700$ km.</p>

<p>What would be the relative brightness (luminosity?) of Jupiter relative to our sun's? </p>
","<p>The absolute visual magnitude of the Sun is about 4.8. (This is the Sun's brightness viewed from 10 parsecs).</p>

<p>The brightest visual magnitude for Jupiter is -2.7, when it is about 4 au from the Earth. Using the usual formula we can therefore calculate the absolute magnitude for Jupiter as 25.9. (Note that this is way brighter than the faintest objects seen for instance with the Hubble Space Telescope; but as Jupiter would be separated from the Sun by only 0.5 arcseconds, a telescope with even better angular resolution than the HST would be needed to pick it out of the glare from the Sun). </p>

<p>Thus to first order Jupiter is 21 visual magnitudes fainter than the Sun (a factor of 250 million) . The situation is slightly worse than this because as seen from outside the solar system, Jupiter could not be <em>fully</em> illuminated, because it must have an angular separation from the Sun to be visible at all. A half-illuminated Jupiter would be at least a magnitude fainter (actually a factor $\pi$ for a Lambertian reflector).</p>

<p>But all is not lost. If we we to switch to the infrared, the situation is far more favourable. The approximate ratio of Jupiter/Sun brightness improves from about $1.4 \times10^{-9}$ in the visible to about $2.8\times10^{-8}$ at a wavelength of 10 microns (<a href=""http://www.amnh.org/content/download/53052/796511/file/DirectImagingChapter.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Traub &amp; Oppenheimer (2010)</a>. But this is still a 19 magnitude difference.</p>

<p>The technology to achieve these sorts of contrasts is not quite there yet, even if we were viewing from nearby stars.  An example of what is currently possible can be seen with the discovery of a few Jupiter mass planet around the star GJ 504 by <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...774...11K"" rel=""nofollow"">Kuzuhara et al. (2013)</a>. The star-planet contrast was about 15-16 magnitudes at near-infrared wavelengths of 1-4 microns and with a star-planet separation of 2.5 arcseconds (equivalent to Jupiter as seen from only 2 parcsecs).</p>

"Which eyepieces I can use it for best viewing experience using my exisiting telescope?","1407","","<p>Telescope: Orion 09843 SpaceProbe 3,3 inch aperture(76mm), 700mm focal length, eyepieces - 25mm and 10mm focal lengths
Hi, I am very happy and excited to   see moon craters, jupiter and saturn. And planets like Mars, Venus, and uranus are just looks 
like a brighter star but not able to see its surface color. Simillary Jupiter looks like white small ball 
instead of an orange surface. I am very much excited and  want to go bit closer. So please guide me list of eyepieces 
that I can use with this scope atleast to see jupiter  surface and big moon craters</p>
","<p>Every scope has a minimum and maximum useful magnification (minimum on your scope is 18X and maximum is 152X - from specs on Telescope.com). Anything outside of those numbers will compromise your ability to see well through the scope. To figure out how best to make use of your scope within the restrictions of useful magnification, you need to start with how to calculate magnification from focal length.</p>

<p>The magnification is equal to the focal length of the telescope divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. For example, your 25mm eyepiece would allow you to get 28X magnification (700mm / 25mm = 28X). Using the same formula, your 10mm eyepiece would allow you to get 70X magnification. For an easy way to get close to 152X, you could purchase a simple 2X Barlow. (700mm / 10mm) * 2X = 140X. For now, start with your 25mm eyepiece and get used to the night sky through it. You can always step it up a bit with other eyepieces later.</p>

<p>So you want to see Jupiter? I think you should just barely be able to make out the dark bands in the atmosphere around 100X (so maybe a 6mm or 7mm eyepiece for your scope). You will definitely be able to see the Galilean Moons though. And speaking of moons, you should get a moon filter to cut down on the brightness when looking at our Moon. I've found it's best to observe the edge of the Moon where light turns to dark. The shadows created along the craters and mountains are magnificent to see. Enjoy!</p>

"What is the temperature 55 km beneath the surface of Mars?","1400","","<p>What is the temperature 55 km (34.18 miles) beneath the surface of Mars?  The reason I ask is that I want to know if it might be habitable for a possible future colony if they could dig that deep (which might be easier in the lower gravity environment).  If the answer to my previous question is correct, this is the depth that the atmospheric pressure would be equivalent to that on Earth. <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/14871/at-what-depth-on-mars-would-the-atmosphere-have-equal-pressure-of-that-on-earth"">At what depth on Mars would the atmosphere have equal pressure of that on Earth?</a></p>

<p>Also, small point, but the 55km estimate assumes uniform temperature.  The simpler pressure calculations don't take into account temperature fluctuation.   With warmer temps and warmer lighter air at the bottom of the dig, which would be inevitable, you'd probably need 60 km, maybe 65 km of depth to achieve 1 atm.  There's also circulation issues when you have cold heavier atmosphere above warm lighter atmosphere and there's drainage/flooding problems for the lowest part of a valley, so to avoid flooding, you might want to keep the surface temperature below freezing, to avoid runoff and silt build-up, or dig even deeper so there's a lake of sorts that catches the melting ground-ice around the dig and the living area is above the lake.  </p>

<p>This doesn't mean that deep valley living on mars will never be possible, but it's likely impossible with it's current atmosphere.  With extensive terraforming, tapping gases from underground and/or from it's ice-caps or by crashing comets into Mars (that would take a lot of comets), over time, enough of an atmosphere could be created where deep valley living might work.    A simulated atmospheric pressure can also be created with a bubble-dome of sorts, or one of my favorites, a stretch-wrap around the entire planet, but for now that's way beyond our means.   </p>

<p>For the near term, living underground on Mars is probably the way to go.   Dig 50 or 100 feet underground and you'd have the means to create a near vacuum seal, which on Mars, you'd want to do, you could create earth like air pressure and you'd be protected from solar and cosmic rays and access to plenty of underground water.   underground on Mars is likely the way to go, at least, in the near future.

For example, illuminance of starlight overcast moonless night sky is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux"">quoted</a> at $0.0001\ lux$ which means that in absence of a brighter light source, human eye simply isn't that sensitive to such low illuminance, even if your hand reflected all of the incoming light (it doesn't). What is the minimum lux rating that a human eye can resolve is not as straightforward to answer though, as it varies greatly by specific wavelengths. This is explained in more detail for example in this <a href=""http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~schubert/Light-Emitting-Diodes-dot-org/Sample-Chapter.pdf"">Human eye sensitivity and photometric quantities (PDF)</a> document, or perhaps <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotopic_vision"">Wikipedia on Scotopic vision</a>.

"What is the Galactic Latitude and Galactic Longitude? How is different from the latitude and longitude we use on Earth?","1387","","<p>It has to something with the positioning of sun and galactic center of the milky way but I wasn't able to understand how for a given star, its co-ordinates are calculated.</p>

<p>Some explanation would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>The Galactic Coordinate system is a longitude-latitude coordinate system that is used to define the positions of objects in space, most commonly objects within our own galaxy. It uses the center of our galaxy as the focal point (i.e., where we consider $(0^{\circ},\:0^{\circ})$), much like we use the position just off Africa as the focal point of the Earth's lon-lat system. You can see a visual representation of this system below.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IG5EE.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IG5EE.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The reference point is of course from our solar system. Longitude is measured in the plane of the galaxy, going positive as you sweep to the left (thus following a right-hand rule). The symbol $\ell$ is generally used for galactic longitude. Latitude is measured above or below the plane, going positive ""above"" the plane and negative ""below"". We define above and below based on the right hand rule as applied to our galaxy's rotation. The symbol $b$ is generally used for galactic latitude.</p>

<p>If someone says an object is at galactic coordinate position $(\ell,b) = (180^{\circ},\:+45^{\circ})$, then the object will be located directly opposite the galactic center and above the plane of the galaxy.</p>

<p>Aside from being a lon-lat system, just as the Earth's is, it does not share any features with Earth's lon-lat system. That is, there's generally no relation between the two and the definition of one is not affected by the other.</p>

","<p>the light from the big bang is in your living room... because that is where the big bang took place... did you know you were so special? Just kidding, but maybe I misunderstood your question. I think what you are asking is, well if you look into deep space you are looking back in time since it takes light X amount of years to travel to the observer. So look far enough back and you would see the big bang right? We already thought of it, and the problem is you can't see the moment of the big bang, because there were no such thing as photon's at that moment. It took about 400,000 years (an afternoon nap on the scale of the universe) for the intensity of the moment of creation to simmer down enough atoms could form removing the opacity of the universe freeing photons to begin their cosmic journeys.. If you were to look out that far you would just see a big opaque blob like trying to look into the center of the sun.  The light from that moment still exists and you do see it... you just don't SEE it. The spectrum of the sun's light that has the highest intensity is in the visible light wavelength.  One would imagine that all species of the universe see in the same wavelength and thus we would all agree on what visible light is. This is not true. We see in the visible wavelengths because of evolution.  Our eyes adapted to the highest intensity light available. Think about natural selection. Ancient primates who could see better would be better hunters. So those who were utilizing the highest intensity light the best would be ideal mating candidates giving birth to more off spring with eyes like there own (a little theory of mine). If you grew up on a planet with a sun that gave off a lot of infrared light you would see in infrared.  Anyway, what I am getting at is if we somehow managed to evolve to this point on a rock with no companion star (an impossibility for all intents and purposes) in some dark corner of the universe where there was no other really intense light around, theoretically eyes would have evolved to see in the cosmic microwave background because it would be the only light available.  CMB radiation (the afterglow of the big bang) is ubiquitous. It is everywhere at once. It gets cooler as time goes on as space time stretches, stretching the wave length of the light making it harder and harder to detect. I hope that answered your question.</p>

The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium#Interstellar_matter"">temperature</a> of interstellar medium seems to range mostly between 10 and 10 000 Kelvin. Is gas/dust an analog for hot/cold, or does the phase diagram of the element in question matter too? Can metals and molecules be gas in astronomical terms?</p>
","<p>Yes, metals and other elements and molecules can exist in gaseous form under the right conditions of temperature and pressure. A ""gas"" is simply one of the fundamental states of matter, as in <em>solid</em>, <em>liquid</em>, or <em>gas</em> (and a few other states outside the scope of this question). But as a gas, these substances exist entirely as either <strong><em>individual</em></strong> atoms, <em>individual</em> elemental molecules, or <em>individual</em> compound molecules of multiple atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide).</p>

<p>Dust, on the other hand, is comprised of tiny particulate matter that has undergone the stronger intermolecular bonds to create substances like ice, silicates, and carbon compounds that float around in varying densities between the stars and between the galaxies. Since these particles are still extremely small (typically a fraction of a micron across), they can <em>appear</em> to be a gas, but these tiny, irregularly-shaped objects still exist individually in a solid or liquid state.</p>

","<p>In order to know when a star will be above horizon, you'll need an equation with times, not ""celestial latitudes"".</p>

  The solar system is thought to have coalesced from a giant rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula about 4.6 billion years ago. For decades, scientists have suspected a star explosion called a supernova helped trigger our solar system's formation. In particular, the shock wave from the explosion is thought to have compressed parts of the nebula, causing these regions to collapse.
  According to this theory, the shock wave would have injected material from the exploding star into the solar nebula.</p>

<p>Then what should I do? Rererence papers with clear definition and expression are welcome.</p>
","<p>Emission measure is (usually) used in X-ray and EUV astronomy, though I suppose also in cases of optically thin radio emission. It is <em>defined as</em> the square of the number density of free electrons integrated over the volume of the plasma.</p>

<p>$${\rm EM} = \int n_e^2 \ dV$$</p>

<p>The flux of optically thin emission from a plasma (e.g. thermal bremsstrahlung) is then directly proportional to the emission measure of the plasma multiplied by a temperature dependent cooling loss law.</p>

<p>In other words, when you measure the flux of X-rays from an unresolved optically thin emitter, there is a degeneracy between the electron number density (squared) and the overall plasma volume.</p>

<p>When you fit an X-ray spectrum with an optically thin model, the emission measure (divided by $4\pi d^2$, where $d$ is the distance to the object), is a multiplicative free parameter.</p>

<p>Your question about calculation is extremely difficult to answer. Suppose I measure a count-rate of $N$ X-ray counts per second using some X-ray telescope (I can only assume that's what you mean by a ""X-ray light curve"".).</p>

<p>The count-rate received at the telescope depends on: the emission measure (as defined above) multiplied by a term that depends on the temperature (or temperatures) of the source, the chemical composition of the source and the adopted emission process (is it free-free thermal bremsstrahlung, a thermal plasma or something else). It is then attenuated by any intrinsic absorption in the source and any absorption between us and the source and by the distance to the source (assuming the radiation is isotropic). Finally what is <em>detected</em> is determined by the response of the X-ray detector to X-ray photons as a function of energy.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>If so by how much does it ""spoil"" the view of stars and galaxies etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several very different issues related to your question. Let's tackle them one by one.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Atmospheric refraction</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the Earth's atmosphere refracts light. One notable effect is that objects near horizon appear higher than they should be.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pCJOn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Therefore, the Sun (or any other object) rises earlier than it should, and sets later.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction</a></p>

<p>It affects astrometry, because it messes up the coordinates of objects near the horizon. Other than that, it does not cause great harm to astronomy.</p>

<hr>

<p>And then there are several effects harmful to astronomy:</p>

<p><strong>1. Seeing</strong></p>

<p>What we call in astronomy ""seeing"" is just air turbulence. Because air moves around due to heat, it distorts the image continuously. This is how the Moon looks like in a telescope - notice the shifting around due to seeing (animated GIF, reload if it's not moving, or open in new tab):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZxTIF.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If we lived in a vacuum, that image would be static, and perfectly clear. But turbulence causes the shifting. Also, it causes a blur - the image is less sharp than it could be. It's also what causes the stars to ""twinkle"".</p>

<p>It's basically the same phenomenon that you see in summer along the hot walls of a house under sunlight - the same shimmering effect of the image seen through the hot rising air along the walls.</p>

<p>For amateur astronomers, seeing affects high-resolution targets such as planets, the Moon, double stars. It does not affect targets that are perceived to be ""low-resolution"" in an amateur telescope: galaxies, nebulae, star clusters.</p>

<p>More reading:</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing</a></p>

<p>Since seeing depends on weather, it can be predicted to some extent:</p>

<p><a href=""http://cleardarksky.com/csk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://cleardarksky.com/csk/</a></p>

<p><strong>2. Light pollution</strong></p>

<p>Atmosphere also scatters and reflects light back to Earth. All the city lights around you are scattered by haze and dust in the air, and some of that light goes back down into your eye, creating sort of a ""light fog"".</p>

<p>As a result, objects that are not too bright are masked by light pollution and become less visible, or invisible altogether.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yngVX.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A bigger telescope will help you pierce through the haze of light pollution, but only to some extent. The best way to see faint objects is to put the scope in the car and drive far away from the city.</p>

<p>Here's a light pollution map:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/</a></p>

"First night on a telescope questions","1338","","<p>So I recently got into astronomy and I am using my fathers old Meade EQ1-B reflector telescope. This is my first night using it and I have come across a few questions. To begin, the telescope was left alone for several years (the scope is a fairly old model) and may have become damaged over time, yet nothing too severe. We were cleaning it and got to the mirror to find that over the years the ""mirror"" cover on top of the glass had chipped away all over, giving the result of a patchy look. </p>

<p>We were testing the scope out during the day and the image was fine - the mirror didn't affect it. Now, I am looking upon stars and have noticed a couple of things. When viewing these stars the image sort of moves, not the scope, the image. As if it were an animation, the star isn't just a white blob, it looks like the sun, where the blob is moving - as if it were a liquid. No I am not stupid enough to point the scope at the sun... during night time. The stars just move like a liquid in the center, is this an effect of the mirror? I can't see why it would be as the image was fine during daylight. Is this how all stars work? I haven't had a chance to point it at the moon or any other planets so I can't test it on an object that isn't a star.</p>

<p>Also, as the scope is a reflector it has the ""three lines"" on the front, however this interferes with the object I am looking at as i can see the lines on the star. Is there any way to stop this, or is it just the result of using a reflector?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Optics can take a huge amount of damage (chipping, scratching) before it really starts to affect performance. You'll be surprised at the amount of abuse a telescope can take like that. As long as it's not properly cracked in two, don't lose any sleep over it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The stars just move like a liquid in the center</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moving around is normal. It is due to atmospheric turbulence, which happens all the time. Unless you're in a vacuum, the images will always shimmer a little. Sometimes they will shimmer a lot. Other times not so much.</p>

<p>In astronomy we have a word for this - it's called seeing:</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, as the scope is a reflector it has the ""three lines"" on the
  front, however this interferes with the object I am looking at as i
  can see the lines on the star.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are way, WAY, <strong>WAY</strong> out of focus. The scope might also be completely miscollimated. The star must not appear like a big blob, with the ""lines"" and the image of the secondary mirror visible in the middle, like in your photo.</p>

<p>The ""lines"" are called spider vanes - they are parts of the assembly called spider, which holds the secondary mirror in place. The vanes, or the secondary mirror itself, must never be visible in the image.</p>

<p>First, do a rough, purely visual collimation. Do this in a place with plenty of light (inside the house). Take out the eyepiece. Look into the focuser. You'll see the secondary mirror. Reflected in it, you'll see the primary mirror from the bottom of the tube. Reflected again in the primary, you'll see the focuser, with your eye in the middle.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qqXkR.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If things are more or less centered, like in the third diagram above, leave it alone. If they are way out of center, like in the first diagram, use the adjustment screws on the mirrors and center everything. Collimation is very important to performance. A miscollimated scope will perform miserably. This is FAR more important than all the scratches on the mirror.</p>

<p>Again, this is purely visual, no-tools collimation. This is all you need for now. You can get a laser collimator later, after all your problems are solved. This is the article where I copied that image from, if you need more info:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-to-collimate-your-newtonian-reflector/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-to-collimate-your-newtonian-reflector/</a></p>

<p>Also see this document:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.etnaastros.com/documents/No_Tools_Collimation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.etnaastros.com/documents/No_Tools_Collimation.pdf</a></p>

<p>Once collimation is done, you need to find true focus. Go outside at night. Point the scope at a medium-bright star. Polaris, <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-North-Star"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">if you can find it</a>, is great because it doesn't move.</p>

<p>Now moving the focuser back and forth, try and determine which way you can make the image of the star appear smaller. Now keep adjusting the focuser until the image of the star is super tiny, then it starts to grow again. Then back off until you make it as tiny as possible. That's when it's in perfect focus.</p>

<p>Now point the scope at a very bright star. If your scope has 3 spider vanes on the secondary mirror, you may see 6 spikes coming out of the star. Like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NktTr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If your scope has 4 vanes, then you should see 4 spikes, like this (it's really 8 spikes, 2 times the number of vanes, but in this case they are superimposed 2 by 2):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1g8vB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The diffraction spikes are easily visible on very bright stars. On medium-size and small stars, they are not easily visible, or not visible at all. This is normal.</p>

<p>Unless the stars are super-tiny dots like in the images above, your scope is not ready for use. Do your best to collimate it and find true focus. Make the stars super-tiny.</p>

<p>Good luck and let me know if you need more advice. It would help a lot if you could find an experienced astronomer nearby to help you fix the scope.</p>

"Existence of gravitons?","1328","","<p>For a lot of my uninformed life, I have doubted the existence of gravitons or even that gravity is an actual ""force"" (like electromagnetism). This is because my vision of general relativity was that mass curves space such that objects are still traveling in a ""straight line"" when being acted upon by ""gravity"", so that no ""force"" is needed. I know now that this is a naive view, but I'm not 100% sure why. I was thinking the other day that just the fact that gravity follows an inverse square law implies that it is a force carried by particles (falling off in flux intensity due to the geometry of 3D space). </p>

<p>My question would be: Does the fact that gravity follows an inverse square law naturally fall out of general relativity equations or is it an assumption used when developing the equations?</p>

<p>And, just now, I had the thought that other forces may curve space also (just in higher dimensions).</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>For a lot of my uninformed life, I have doubted the existence of gravitons or even that gravity is an actual ""force"" (like electromagnetism).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gravity is a force like electromagnetism, but it does have a special property in that all test particles fall the same way in a gravitational field, no matter their composition. This means that inertial masses and gravitational masses are the same (or at least universally proportional, so we can use units in which they are equal), and we are free to interpret gravitational freefall as inertial motion.</p>

<p>In terms of quantum field theory, it is actually a theorem that at low energies, massless spin-2 particles must couple to all energy-momentum equally, regardless of particle species. In other words, the equivalence principle of general relativity is a provable theorem for gravitons.</p>

<p>Conversely, we can also interpret general relativity as a massless spin-2 field on a flat background spacetime, but because of this universality, the background will be unobservable by any experiment. That's why relativists don't tend to do this, as it makes the geometric interpretation is more convenient.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, quantized general relativity is very badly behaved if one tries to take them to arbitrarily energy scales. Physically, this means that some new physics must come in before then to fix it. However, this kind of situation is hardly unique to gravity, quantizing which still makes sense as an effective field theory at lower energies; cf. <a href=""http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2004-5/"">living review by Cliff P. Burgess</a>. The tension between general relativity and quantum mechanics is often overstated in popular descriptions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My question would be: Does the fact that gravity follows an inverse square law naturally fall out of general relativity equations or is it an assumption used when developing the equations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inverse-square part falls out by itself, but the specific constant of proportionality needs an additional assumption.</p>

<p>If one considers a general field equation $G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}$, where $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor that is assumed to be symmetric and covariantly conserved, then the Einstein tensor $G_{\mu\nu} \equiv R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R$ is the unique scale-invariant solution that can built from the metric. This requirement means that only terms that are second-order in derivatives of the metric are allowed, and it is broken by e.g. cosmological constant term $\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}$, as this introduces a length $\Lambda^{-1/2}\sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{ly}$ into the theory.</p>

<p>There are other ways of developing the Einstein field equation, e.g. via the Einstein-Hilbert action, which don't need specific assumptions about the stress-energy tensor. Regardless, the role of the Newtonian limit is in fixing the value of the otherwise undetermined constant $\kappa = 8\pi G/c^4$. If you're only interested in a Newton-like inverse-square relationship, then <em>that alone</em> doesn't need any additional assumptions about trying to match Newtonian gravity.</p>

<p>Given a timelike vector field $u$, which can be interpreted as the four-velocities of some family of observers, we can write the time-time projection of an equivalent form of the Einstein field equation, $R_{\mu\nu} = \kappa(T_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}T)$, as
$$R_{00} \equiv R_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu = \frac{1}{2}\kappa(\rho+3p)\text{,}$$
where $\rho$ is the energy density and $p$ is the average of the principal stresses as measured by an observer with four-velocity $u$. For non-relativistic matter, the stress terms are negligible compared to the energy density.</p>

<p>The way the Newtonian limit is typically discusses is to use the weak-field approximation, $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}$ with $|h_{\mu\nu}|\ll 1$, to show that
$$\frac{1}{2}\kappa\rho\approx R_{00} = R^\alpha{}_{0\alpha 0}\approx\partial_\alpha\Gamma^{\alpha}_{00}\approx-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2h_{00}\text{,}$$
which then has the form of Poisson's equation for Newtonian gravitational potential in terms of matter density $\rho_\text{m}$, i.e. $\nabla^2\Phi = 4\pi G\rho_\text{m}$. For slow-moving test particles, the geodesic equation reduces to the Newtoni an equation of motion:
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{x}}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = \frac{1}{2}\nabla h_{00} = -\nabla\Phi\text{.}$$
Another way to think of this is to write down the proper time of freefalling particle and show that extremizing it is equivalent to extremizing  $\int\left(\frac{1}{2}v^2+\frac{1}{2}h_{00}\right)\mathrm{d}t$, which is the action action (per mass) of a particle subject to Newtonian gravity whenever $h_{00} \approx -2\Phi/c^2$.</p>

<p>You may be interested in <a href=""http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/einstein/node6a.html"">this simpler derivation</a> of Newton's law of gravitational around a spherically symmetric body, based on the geometric interpretation of the Ricci curvature as the acceleration of the volume of a small ball of initially comoving test particles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, just now, I had the thought that other forces may curve space also (just in higher dimensions).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was done for electromagnetism by Kaluza and Klein shortly after GTR, but it turns out that it's not a directly useful way to think about other forces.</p>

<p>Instead, we can think of Riemann curvature in general relativity as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature_form"">curvature form</a> of the Levi-Civita connection on the tangent bundle of a given manifold, with structure group $\mathrm{O}(1,n)$. But in this language, the electromagnetic field strength is the curvature of the connection $ieA_\mu$ over a line bundle with structure group $\mathrm{U}(1)$. The other non-gravitational forces are similarly described by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory"">Yang-Mills theory</a>.</p>

<p>In other words, the other forces already have a description in which they're caused by a curvature, just not of spacetime. So while gravity is different from them, it's not different enough to consider it in some sense 'less real' than the others.</p>

"Would an exoplanet without axial tilt have no seasons?","1319","","<p>Would an Earth analog exoplanet which rotates around a solar analog, but without axial tilt, have no seasons?</p>

<p>Would it be similar to how Los Angeles does not have very noticeable seasons compared to other parts of the Earth?</p>
","<p>There are several factors that cause seasons.  In approximate order from least to most speculative:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Axial Tilt</strong>:  This is by far the significant factor in determining what the season is on Earth.  As you may know, axial tilt affects the seasons because the light is ""spread out"" when it falls on an angled surface.  Note that tilt causes different seasons in different hemispheres.  An untilted planet could still have seasons for any of these other reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Eccentricity</strong>:  The Earth's orbit is very close to circular, so eccentricity has next to no effect on causing its seasons (and in fact, IIRC, currently Earth's eccentricity's tiny effect is actually <em>opposing</em> its seasons).  An exoplanet with a high eccentricity could easily have <em>planet-wide</em> seasons due to varying distance from its sun.</li>
<li><strong>Star Systems</strong>:  As a commenter mentioned, another factor might be how many stars a system has.  If such a solar system is stable (which, surprisingly, it might be, although I can't find the article at the moment), you could get seasons depending on where the stars are in their mutual orbits.  A binary star system, for example, would have periods of winter when the stars align with the planets (so one blocks the other) and periods of summer when the stars are side-by-side.</li>
<li><strong>Star Variation</strong>:  (From a comment): believe it or not, the sun actually has ""seasons"" (<a href=""http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast22jul99_1/"">here</a>) that are on the order of a decade or so.  These don't have much effect on Earth's climate since on the sun they mainly cause magnetic disturbances, but on an exoplanet the star's magnetic disturbances could be relatively larger, which would lead to significant temperature/brightness variations that would translate into seasons.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Energy</strong>:  Planets could have varying/cyclic sources of energy within them, just like solar masses.  In our own solar system, Jupiter's seasons are partly due to this.  On a terrestrial planet, variations might come from, for example, volcanic activity.  Negative feedback loops of this sort will exhibit oscillations.  These sorts of changes might not count as ""seasons"" for you, though, as they occur over larger timescales.</li>
<li><strong>Stored Energy</strong>: Earth's seasons are complicated by the oceans, which greatly affect the intensity of the seasons, especially in the Americas.  In particular, there are various cycles that work like subseasons underlying the main ones.  The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, for example, affects seasons years apart.  I don't see why an exoplanet couldn't have similar cycles that, unlike in the case of Earth, are the main factor in determining seasons.  This could be stored gravitational energy too; for example in a tidally-locked exoplanet/moon system.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mean a true Earth-like analogue (in the sense of being exactly-like-Earth-in-every-way-except-the-axial-tilt), then no--it would not have noticeable seasons, since none of the above factors really apply.</p>

","<p>Basically you need to convert between luminosities (which you can add) and magnitudes using 
$$M-M_\odot=-2.5\log_{10}(L/L_\odot)$$
Let's call the total luminosity $L_0$ and magnitude $M_0$ and the individual luminosities and magnitudes $L_1$, $L_2$ and $L_3$ and $M_1$, $M_2$ and $M_3$.
Then, you have the total luminosity of the system, directly
$$L_0/L_\odot=10^{-0.4(M_0-M_\odot)}$$
and as the sum of the components
$$L_0/L_\odot=(L_1+L_2+L_3)/L_\odot=10^{-0.4(M_1-M_\odot)}+10^{-0.4(M_2-M_\odot)}+10^{-0.4(M_3-M_\odot)}$$
Solving these equations for $M_3$ gives
$$M_3-M_\odot=-2.5\log_{10}\left(10^{-0.4(M_0-M_\odot)}-10^{-0.4(M_1-M_\odot)}-10^{-0.4(M_2-M_\odot)}\right)$$
I'm assuming you have absolute magnitudes, but you can rewrite the formulae in terms of apparent magnitudes using
$$M=m+5(1-\log_{10}d)$$

","<p>Stars don't ""burn"", they undergo <em>nuclear</em> reactions that do not involve atoms and chemistry at all. The temperatures in the interiors of stars, and certainly in the interiors of stellar remnants like C/O white dwarfs, are <em>far</em> too hot (millions of degrees) for electrons to bind to nuclei and far too hot for molecules to survive. The energy required to break up carbon dioxide is 5.5 eV, which is easily provided unless a gas is cooled well below 10,000K. </p>

<p>The only parts of a star where chemistry can occur is in the outer atmospheres where temperatures can drop to thousands of degrees and where atoms and partially ionised atoms can exist. Here, yes, then it is possible for carbon atoms and oxygen atoms to interact, but that would mostly produce carbon <em>mon</em>oxide. This molecule is produced and can survive between temperatures of about 1100K and 3500K in the atmospheres of cool M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs and the atmospheres of red giant stars.</p>

","<p>It appears (and I am no expert) that Saturn's ring evolution is governed mainly by ""viscous spreading"" - collisions between ring particles; and also by interactions with Saturn's moons (resonances); and bombardment with meteoritic material.</p>

<p>There appears to be no consensus on how old the ring system is. Most theories of their formation have this taking place early in the life of the solar system, but there are observations that suggest little contamination by meteoritic material and hence that the rings are young.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Icar..209..771S"">Salmon et al.

On the other hand, comparing viscous spreading models with the current density profile of Saturn's rings suggests they are much less than a billion years old. However, it should be noted that other authors have used similar models to argue that Saturn's rings did indeed form 4.5 billion years ago and were much more massive (by a factor $&gt;100$) then they are today! <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Icar..216..535C"">(Charnoz et al. 2011)</a></p>

"Binaries consisting of a black hole and a non-black hole?","1299","","<p>Are there any known binary systems in which one member is a black hole and the other is not a black hole (main sequence star, giant, neutron star, white dwarf, whatever)?</p>

<p>Googling seems to turn up only discussion of binaries in which both components are black holes. Is there some astrophysical reason why the kind of system I'm talking about cannot form? I think I remember that gravitational wave observatories have talked about black hole-neutron star mergers, but are such systems purely hypothetical so far?</p>

<p>I guess Sagittarius A* is sort of close to being an example, if you count it and the stars orbiting it (or orbiting their common barycenter) as a multiple star system.</p>
","<h2>Black hole and main sequence star/giant star</h2>

<p>We can observe binary systems containing a black hole by looking for emissions from accretion disks which may form when matter is transferred from the companion star. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">X-ray binaries</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microquasar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">microquasars</a> are particularly notable types.</p>

<p>The compact object doesn't have to be a black hole - neutron stars also sometimes show up - but in some cases, measurements indicate that the remnant is a black hole. In other cases, either the mass of the compact object is poorly constrained or could still be a massive neutron star, so for many systems, the nature of this object remains unknown.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cygnus X-1</a>:</strong> The companion star here is HDE 226868, a massive O-type star.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V404_Cygni"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">V404 Cygni</a>:</strong> The companion star is a K-type star (much less massive than HDE 226868); the system forms a <em>microquasar</em>, with occasional high-energy x-ray emission.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Black hole and white dwarf</h2>

<p>It seems a logical assumption that black hole/white dwarf systems should be possible, and indeed they are. Mass loss through accretion by a companion object can change a star's evolutionary future (see the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol_paradox"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Algol paradox</a> for a particularly weird case), but for many systems with a black hole, the ""normal"" star should still progress through the main sequence and post-main-sequence evolution, possibly becoming a white dwarf.</p>

<p>Matter transfer can still happen at this stage, of course, so emission may continue, although the nature of the radiation could be changed. It's true that there aren't many known systems of this type, but there almost certainly more.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/17_releases/press_031317.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">X9</a>:</strong> The companion star is a white dwarf orbiting extremely close to the black hole. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02167"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bahramian et al.</a> are confident that the companion is a white dwarf, and the main object is likely a black hole.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Black hole and neutron star</h2>

<p>These type of systems are possibly the most interesting from a gravitational point of view. They should produce gravitational waves, which could be detectable by LIGO.<sup>1</sup> <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/832/2/L21"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LIGO has yet to observe such a system</a>, which seems a bit puzzling, although something like the blue supergiant in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Cygnus X-3</strong></a> could evolve into a neutron star in the future. This is a case where more data and observations are needed.</p>

<hr>

"How exactly is our universe mapped?","1299","","<p>Watching <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6kxVnPrbjs"" rel=""nofollow"">this youtube video</a> shows that our planet is nothing more than dust in the wind.</p>

<p>At the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6kxVnPrbjs#t=2m40s"" rel=""nofollow"">2:50</a> mark in the video, you will see a view of the whole Milky Way. At the bottom you will see this text </p>

<p><code>Light travel time from earth: 100,000 years</code></p>

<p>Which means if we travel at light speed we need 100,000 years to go far from the Milky Way.</p>

<p>If nothing can travel faster than light, and if it takes 100,000 years to go far from the Milky Way at light speed </p>

<p><strong>How did they map our whole universe, which has a radius of 13.798±0.037 billion light years?</strong>   </p>
","<p>The simple answer is that light from the distant parts of the Milky Way Galaxy have <strong>already been traveling</strong> for that amount of time. Because light does not travel instantaneously through space, we are seeing the galaxy not as it is now, but as it was 100,000 (or so) years ago. </p>

<p>Incidentally, this is also how we are able to see back to earlier moments of the universe's history. In terms of distance, the further we look, the longer light would have had to leave in order to reach us today. </p>

<p>The universe did have a beginning (at least in the sense of having an earliest time). Because the universe is not infinitely old, there is actually a limit to how far we can see back into the universe's history (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cosmological horizon</a>). We are able to make maps of the universe, like this one from <a href=""http://www.sdss.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SDSS</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LHa3B.jpg"" alt=""SDSS Map""></p>

<p>by running what's known as a survey. These are large projects which maps out the positions (and potentially other properties, depending on what their science goals are) of galaxies in the universe. How you should look at this picture is the following: 1) You're at the center of the image, 2) Each point in the picture represents an individual galaxy, 3) Distance from the observer, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">redshift</a> of a galaxy, increases with increasing distance from the center, and 4) as you travel around the circle in angle, you're sweeping through the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">right ascension</a> coordinate of the celestial coordinate system (think longitude). You're seeing a pizza slice instead of a sphere because this is a particular slice in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">declination</a> (lattitude). As you look to higher redshifts, you are looking further back into time, and earlier into the universe's history. This is how astronomers/cosmologists can say something <em>statistically</em> about models of structure formation of the universe (how objects like galaxies, and clusters of galaxies came to be).</p>

<p>The problem with looking at galaxies at very high redshifts is that they become
very faint. At a certain point, you need more powerful telescopes to continue looking further back in time. Though, we can get around this somewhat by looking at the radiation component of the universe at microwave wavelengths (most surveys are in the optical region of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">electro-magnetic spectrum</a>). This radiation is called the cosmic microwave background radiation (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CMB</a>), and can also be mapped out (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">COBE</a>,<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wmap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WMAP</a>, and most recently <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_%28spacecraft%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Planck</a> satellites).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YZEtL.jpg"" alt=""Planck Map""></p>

<p>This is also a map of sorts. This map of low energy photons is a snapshot of the universe approximately ~380,000 (redshift of z=1100; meaning the universe was smaller by about a factor of 1101) years after the big bang, when the universe had very little of what we would recognize as structure. The job of the cosmologist is to connect the picture we see from the CMB to the picture we see from our surveys of galaxies through the use of physics.   </p>

"Why don't Neutron Stars form event horizon?","1297","","<p>Trying to compare density of Black Holes and Neutron Stars I came up with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A typical neutron star has a mass between about 1.4 and 3.2 solar masses<a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=219"">1</a>[3] (see Chandrasekhar Limit), with a corresponding radius of about 12 km. (...) Neutron stars have overall densities of 3.7×10^17 to 5.9×10^17 kg/m^3 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star"">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can use the Schwarzschild radius to calculate the ""density"" of the black hole - i.e., the mass divided by the volume enclosed within the Schwarzschild radius. This is roughly equal to (1.8x10^16 g/cm^3) x (Msun / M)^2 (...)</p>
  
  <p>The value of the Schwarzschild radius works out to be about (3x10^5 cm) x (M / Msun) <a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=219"">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's take a neutron star from the top of the spectrum (3.2 Msun) and same mass black hole.</p>

<p>Converting units: </p>

<ul>
<li>Neutron star: 5.9×10^17 kg/m^3 = 5.9 × 10^14 g/cm^3 </li>
<li>Black hole: 1.8x10^16 g/cm^3 x (1/5.9)^2 = 5.2 x10^14 g/cm^3 </li>
</ul>

<p>The radius of the black hole would be (3x10^5 cm) x ( 5.2 ) = 15.6km</p>

<p>The 3.2Msun Neutron Star of this density would have volume of 1.08 x 10^13 m^3 which gives radius of 13.7 kilometers</p>

<p>According to Shell Theorem, spherical objects' gravity field strength at given distance is the same for spheres as for point masses so at the same distance from center of same mass (point - black hole, sphere - neutron star) the gravity will be the same.</p>

<p>That would put the surface of the neutron star below the surface of event horizon of equivalent black hole. Yet I never heard about even horizon of neutron stars.</p>

<p>Either I made a mistake in my calculations (and if I did, could you point it out?) or... well, why?</p>
","<p>As Francesco Montesano points out, using the wrong mass leads to the wrong answer.  Also, using the density here seems a complicated way to get to the answer; you could compute the Schwarzschild radius for the NS, and see whether it's smaller than its actual radius.</p>

<p>Since the density scales as &rho; ~ M/R^3 and the Schwarzschild radius as R<sub>s</sub>~M, the density of BHs scales as &rho;~1/R^2; more massive BHs are less dense and simply testing whether a NS is denser than a BH alone is not sufficient - they must be of the same mass, which means that you are in fact comparing radii.</p>

"Which came first: Galaxies <=> Stars <=> Planets?","1293","","<p>If a galaxy is <strong>defined</strong> as a collection of planetary systems (and all matter in between), and a planetary system is defined as a collection of planets circling a star (and all matter in between), and a planet (and other smaller bodies, like asteroids, moonlets, moons, etc) is basically just a very very, very large collection of minerals, stardust and gases (which make up the entire universe), <strong>which came first: The planets, planetary systems or galaxies?</strong> <em>I've been given to understand the universe came first...but after that?</em></p>

<p><strong>Is this just me getting the semantics of classification and the actual chronology of each feature forming, mixed up?</strong> </p>

<hr>

<p>VERY Basically,</p>

<ul>
<li>The universe is made up of a complex mix of everything (matter, antimatter, darkmatter, to name just a few), and expanding 'space'.</li>
<li>A very, very, large area of 'space' is covered in very, very, tiny particles: made up of at first gases and later 'stardust'.</li>
<li>A galaxy is formed of gravity-attracted gases, and after the very first stars went supernova and exploded there was also 'stardust', which combines to create 'clumps' of interstellar clouds (cloud nebulae).</li>
<li>The cloud nebulae are the 'nursery' areas for star formation (both initial stars and later generation stars). </li>
<li>The newly created star uses remnants of 'stardust' in the cloud nebulae to form planetary systems and then, a 'short' time later the orbiting planets (and other sized objects). </li>

<h2><hr></h2>

<p>Just writing out this question has helped! I hope you don't mind me posting it anyway, as it might help others and <strong>I still need confirmation that I have</strong>, hopefully, worked myself <em>out of</em> my conundrum (not deeper).</p>
","<p>The structure we see in the Universe has formed from the gravitational collapse of the matter that was once an almost smooth density field of gas (""baryons"") and dark matter$^1$. The word ""almost"" is important here, for if it had been completely — or even non-completely but much more — smooth, then the collapse would not have had the time to happen before the expansion of space has diluted the matter enough to prevent any collapse, and we would never had come into existence.</p>

<p>That is, the density field was slightly clumpy, and these clumps — or <em>overdensities</em> — existed on all scales.
But calculating which clump sizes collapse <em>first</em> — stellar-sized, galaxy-sized, cluster-sized, etc. — is far from trivial. Analytical attempts has to make several approximations, but can still make quite meaningful predictions which have subsequently been backed up and refined by numerical simulations, and by now, although many loose ends still exist, we have a rather good picture of structure formation:</p>

<strong>Gravitational collapse</strong>

<p>An overdensity is denoted by
$\delta\equiv\rho/\langle\rho\rangle - 1$, where $\rho$ is the density of the overdensity and $\langle\rho\rangle$ is the average density.
The evolution of overdensities under the force of gravity can be calculated exactly for $\delta \ll 1$ using linear perturbation theory, but when $\delta$ becomes of order unity, the non-linear regime is entered, and severe approximations must be made, so one turns instead to numerical simulations. It turns out that if $\delta\gtrsim1.68$ (i.e. if a region in space has a density which is 2.68 times the ambient density), it will collapse. The answer to your question is then given by what size of clumps first reach $\delta\gtrsim1.68$.</p>

<strong>First clumps</strong>

<p>Primordial quantum fluctuations$^2$ grew in size during the (admittedly still pretty blurry) inflation, a fraction of a second after Big Bang. In the young Universe dark energy was negligible, and the dynamics of the Universe was dominated by matter. Because dark matter comprises $\sim5/6$ of the total amount, we can initially neglect the presence of gas, but when the density becomes very high, gas pressure builds up and counteracts the collapse.</p>

<p>The overdensities amplified as matter started to collapse. It turns out that the density fluctuations are larger for smaller scales, so the smaller the clump, the sooner it will collapse. This results in the so-called ""bottom-up"" formation of structure, which is in contrast to what was originally thought; namely that galaxies formed ""top-down"" in a monolithic collapse (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962ApJ...136..748E"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eggen, Lynden-Bell, &amp; Sandage 1962</a>).</p>

<p>However, this approach neglects both gas and the motion of dark matter particles (treating it as so-called <em>cold dark matter</em>). Taking into account the effects of this puts a lower threshold for the masses of the structures of $\sim10^5$-$10^6M_\odot$ (e.g. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604050"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Naoz et al. 2006</a>; <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4372v1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yoshida 2009</a>). Hence the first structures that formed are believed to be minihalos roughly the mass of globular clusters.</p>

<strong>Stars, galaxies, and clusters</strong>

<p>Stars consist of collapsed gas and almost no dark matter, and the formation of a star thus needs the theory of hydrodynamics rather than just gravity. In order for matter to collapse to such dense structures as stars, it must get rid of much of its energy. This is not possible for the collisionless dark matter (at least in the normal sense, but <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/14433/5264"">this post</a>), but gas, which can collide and cool by radiating, is able to do so$^3$.</p>

<p>Through radiative cooling, the minihalos thus fragmented further into first gas clouds and then the first stars when the Universe was a few 100 million years old. Subsequently conglomerations of stars merged into galaxies, which eventually formed sheets, filaments and clusters of galaxies.</p>

<strong>Dust</strong>

<p>The first stars were formed out of pure hydrogen and helium (and small amounts of lithium), and the material for making planets did not exist. But when these stars — which were very massive — exploded as supernovae and polluted the interstellar medium with metals$^4$ and stardust$^5$, the formation of less massive stars became possible$^6$.</p>

<strong>Planets</strong>

<p>Dust particles stick together to form pebbles, rocks, and planets. Planet formation is probably not possible for too massive stars$^7$, but with the formation of small stars this became possible.</p>

<p><strong>Thus, we can make the following timeline:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Minihalos → gas clouds → stars → galaxies → stardust → planets.</strong></p>

<p>However, note that the merging of minihalos to larger ""galaxies"" (without a significant amount of stars) also may happen at earlier epochs, and in particular that star formation (and dust and planets) is a continuous process which still takes place today (although the bulk of the star formation took place when the Universe approximately 3–6 billion years old (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9708220"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Madau et al. 1998</a>)).</p>

It was like a triangle with it's nose pointing towards the east. The sides that converged to the nose <em>seemed</em> to extend a bit backwards like antennas.</p>

<p>And to the west (a few inches north to the Orion was this strange glow. 
At first I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me as sometimes whenever you stare into light bulb or some other light source, a faint glow in that area of your vision often persists. And as I looked directly at it, it slowly faded away into darkness and all that was distinguishable was an extremely tiny star or two. But whenever I looked to something near it (like a tree or constellation) , the patch reappeared. Then, I noticed that there was cluster of tiny little stars. I couldn't make out much. <strong>What caused that light patch?</strong> It seemed to glow in and out like it was breathing.

"How can I convolve a template spectrum with a photometric filter response spectrum?","1276","","<p>Suppose I have a template stellar population spectrum (say, from Bruzual &amp; Charlot 2003) which runs from like 1000 Angstroms to 160,000 Angstroms and which has x-axis wavelength units of Angstroms and y-axis flux density units of $L_{\odot}$ per Angstrom. Now, let's say I want to get the integrated luminosity within a bandpass that runs from $\lambda_1$ to $\lambda_2$ Angstroms, and I have another ""spectrum"" which gives me the filter response function for this photometric bandpass. </p>

<p>I know that I'm supposed to ""convolve the stellar template spectrum with the bandpass response function"" in order to get the integrated stellar luminosity within my bandpass, but how do I do this exactly (preferably in python)? The stellar template and filter response spectra don't have the same number of data points and are not defined on the same wavelength grid (the stellar template spectrum obviously extends much further than the filter response function). </p>

<p>I feel like I could interpolate the filter response spectrum onto the wavelength array of the stellar template spectrum, and assign a value of 0 to the interpolated response spectrum for wavelengths outside $\lambda_1$ to \lambda_2$. Then I would be able to do a simple element-wise multiplication, but this does not seem like the correct approach using traditional ""convolution."" </p>
","<p>Your feeling is right: You shouldn't convolve the spectrum and the filter, you should only multiply so that flux outside the bandpass is suppressed. Subsequently you integrate the resulting function over wavelength, so that flux density (in energy/time/area/wavelength) becomes flux (in energy/time/area).</p>

<p>Simply setting the flux to 0 outside $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ (or, equivalently, just integrating from $\lambda_1$ to $\lambda_2$) corresponds to a ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-hat_filter"" rel=""nofollow"">top-hat filter</a>"". Most realistic filters are more smooth.</p>

<p>So, something like (untested):</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import simps

lamS,spec = np.loadtxt('spectrum.dat',unpack=True) #Two columns with wavelength and flux density
lamF,filt = np.loadtxt('filter.dat'  ,unpack=True) #Two columns with wavelength and response in the range [0,1]
filt_int  = np.interp(lamS,lamF,filt)              #Interpolate to common wavelength axis
filtSpec  = filt_int * spec                        #Calculate throughput
flux      = simps(filtSpec,lamS)                   #Integrate over wavelength
print 'Total flux is {0:8.3e}'.format(flux)
</code></pre>

<strong>Magnitude</strong>

<p>I'm wondering, however, if ""the total luminosity within the bandpass"" is really what you're interested in. This quantity doesn't really bear any physical significance for the source, as it depends on the particular filter. Usually, one would normalize to the filter, thus getting the <em>magnitude</em>, which is independent of the filter shape.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_magnitude"" rel=""nofollow"">AB magnitude</a> system, the magnitude $m_\mathrm{AB}$ of a source is (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ApJ...266..713O"" rel=""nofollow"">Oke &amp; Gunn 1983</a>; note that they make a sign error in their own definition):
$$
m_\mathrm{AB} = -2.5 \log f_\nu -48.6,
$$
where the average $f_\nu$ in $\mathrm{erg} \,\mathrm{s}^{-1} \,\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ is given by
$$
f_\nu = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\int ST\lambda\,d\lambda}{\int T / \lambda\,d\lambda},
$$
where $S$ is the spectrum with units $\mathrm{erg} \,\mathrm{s}^{-1} \,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ Å$^{-1}$, $T$ is the filter curve (un-normalized as above), $\lambda$ is the wavelength in Ångström, and $c$ is the speed of light in Å $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

"What scientific evidence is there to support or refute the Iron Sun Hypothesis?","1266","","<p>Professor Oliver Manuel,  a professor of nuclear chemistry at the University of Missouri-Rolla, claims in the article <a href=""http://www.spacedaily.com/news/iron-02b.html"">Sun Is Made Of Iron, Not Hydrogen, Professor Says</a> that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iron, not hydrogen, is the sun's most abundant element.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, he and his colleagues postulate that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""We think that the solar system came from a single star, and the sun formed on a collapsed supernova core,"" Manuel says. ""The inner planets are made mostly of matter produced in the inner part of that star, and the outer planets of material form the outer layers of that star.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there evidence to support or refute Professor Manuel's theories?</p>
","<p>If the sun was principally composed of Iron, then this would be apparent in the spectrum of light from the sun (which is how we know what stars are made of) (but see comment by @Keith Thompson below, the spectra only tells you about the surface, rather than the core).  The fact that all solar physicists bar one seem to think it is made up of hydrogen and helium strongly suggests this is not the case.</p>

<p>If the sun were made of iron, then I suspect that would require a revision of our understanding of nuclear fusion, as iron is the product of the final fusion reaction that stars can <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon-burning_process"">support</a>, unless of course the theory is that the sun is no longer undergoing fusion reactions and all we have been seeing for the last <em>4 billion years+</em> is the residual heat of the core.</p>

<p>Apparently <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157307004565"">heliosiesmology</a> suggests there isn't that much iron in the suns core (although the physics is beyond me, so caveat lector).</p>

<p>As a further point, if the sun is primarily made of iron, it becomes difficult to explain why the planets (especially the gas giants) have so little of it.  It is reasonably straightforward to explain why the inner planets have lost much of their original hydrogen and helium, but rather more difficult to explain how the outer planets could have become hydrogen enriched.</p>

<p>Update.  Dr Manuel's website claims that <a href=""http://www.thesunisiron.com/"">""About 99% of the sun has the same composition as ordinary meteorites.""</a>.  The density of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites is about <a href=""http://meteorites.wustl.edu/id/density.htm"">2100-34700 kg/m3</a> (with porosity being an issue).  The mean density of the sun is <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solar/sun.html"">1410 kg/m3</a>.  Given the temperature and pressure within the suns' core, if it had a similar composition to a meteorite its' porosity would be zero, and hence even more dense than an ordinary meteorite.  There is a problem with accounting here, if 99% of the sun had a composition similar to that of a meteorite, it would have to be full of voids to have the suns observed density.  The figures just don't add up as far as I can see (although how materials may behave at ultra high temperatures and pressures means intuition may be invalid here).</p>

<p>For Manuel to be right, pretty much all we know about stars must be wrong.</p>

"Why do planets move in an elliptical orbit?","1262","","<p>I am a student of class 9 and recently came to know about kepler's law of planetary motion and got confused about the foci and elliptical orbits of planets and some stars.</p>
","<p>Not sure if you're looking for a more mathematical answer or just the ""why"", but to answer the why, I'll start with some history on this.</p>

<p>Everyone who worked out a model for the Solar System, from Aristotle to Copernicus, liked circles.  Even though Copernicus correctly reasoned that the Earth moved around the Sun and not the Sun around the Earth, he continued to use circles in his models of the motion of the planets.  </p>

<p>After Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, funded by the King of Denmark, had the best equipment at the time for observing the motion of the stars and planets and he was able to make star charts that were ten times as accurate as anyone before him. Brahe used equipment like <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Tycho-Brahe-quadrant_01.png"" rel=""nofollow"">this mural quadrant</a>, and a large private observatory to take extremely accurate records.</p>

<p>Kepler, who was a better mathematician than Brahe, desperately wanted to get his hands on Brahe's star charts and the use of his observatory and equipment (so much so that when Brahe died, there were rumors that Kepler had poisoned him, though that probably didn't happen). When Kepler finally had everything at his disposal, he was able to work things out and study the Solar System more accurately. However, he still didn't know why the planets moved in ellipses; he'd only worked out that the ellipses fit the movement so well that it almost certainly had to be true, but he had no idea why.</p>

<p>Kepler, in fact, didn't care for ellipses.  He liked circles better, but he couldn't deny that ellipses worked.  <a href=""http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/EveningStar/Unit2/unit2_sub4.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a>.</p>

<p>Nobody knew why planets moved in ellipses until Isaac Newton was asked that question and had to invent calculus to answer it.  Calculus explains why planets orbit in ellipses, and that's the real answer.  </p>

<p>If ""calculus"" isn't a satisfying answer, a way to kind of explain it would be to throw a penny out of a space shuttle (which isn't a good idea, but let's say you do). As the penny falls towards the Earth, it falls faster and faster (if we ignore air resistance) until it hits the ground.</p>

<p>Now, if you fling the penny from the space shuttle at a much faster speed and at a different angle, so that it only gets <strong>near Earth</strong> and misses the planet, it would actually start to orbit Earth. It would fall faster and faster until it passes the Earth, and then, like shooting a bullet into the air, the penny will slow down as it flies past the Earth. </p>

<p>According to Kepler's second law, the penny's fastest speed is at the point closest to the Earth (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis"" rel=""nofollow"">the perigee</a>). That's essentially how objects in orbits work: as they move closer to the body they orbit, they accelerate faster and faster. Our penny will get so fast that, once it comes around the planet, it will be flung very far away, which will then slow it down. This is what creates an elliptical orbit.</p>

<p>Its motion is like a spring, falling toward the planet then flying away, but at the same time, orbiting in a circular motion with the spring motion, with 1 period per orbit. That motion of moving closer and then further in each orbit forms an ellipse.  </p>

<p>It makes the most sense if you think of the velocity being greatest at the closest point and lowest at the furthest point. The low velocity moves it closer while the high velocity moves it back out further.  The total energy of the object in orbit (kinetic energy plus potential energy) remains constant. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8AEiY.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>A hybrid eclipse is one in which it is a total eclipse in some places and an annular eclipse is seen in other places. </p>

<p>As you may know, a total eclipse is one in which the moon completely covers the disc of the Sun; this allows the solar corona to be seen.  Usually the central disc of the Sun is so bright that the corona cannot be seen.  An annular eclipse is one in which the Moon is not quite ""large"" enough to completely block out the Sun - instead, a ring of the Sun's central disc can be seen around the Moon. This ring is too bright for the corona to be seen.  Photos of both eclipse types appear below.</p>

<p>The type of eclipse is determined by the geometry of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.  Since the Sun and Moon are not constantly at the same distance from the Earth, their apparent sizes will differ. When the Moon is closer to the Earth it appears larger, and when the Sun is farther away it will appear smaller.  For this particular eclipse, the geometry is such that the western part of the eclipse's center line will see an annular eclipse, but the rest will have a total eclipse.</p>

"Why aren't brown dwarfs the dark matter?","1251","","<p>There seems to be not enough matter to account for the fact that the speed of some stars located far from the Galaxy center is almost the same speed as those stars found nearer to the center of the Galaxy, therefore it seems there should be even more matter: so this missing matter is termed dark matter. There is a kind of stellar object that isn't massive enough to produce its own light but is many times more massive than Jupiter, a.k.a brown dwarf. Since it isn't bright enough to be detected by our deep space telescope nor the earth bound counterparts, they should be numerous in galaxies as I believe these objects sits in the middle range between planets and stars. However it seems the scientific community had ruled out this potential dark matter candidate without scanning the unobservable Milky Way galaxy as well as billions other with different light spectrums. Why aren't brown dwarfs considered candidates for the mysterious dark matter?</p>
","<p>Two reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We know from looking at galaxy rotation curves and the motion of galaxies in clusters and from gravitational lensing, that the amount of ""dark matter"" is some 30% of the density of the universe. But on the other hand, estimates of the abundances of deuterium, helium, tritium and lithium produced in the big bang indicate that only 5% of the density of the universe can be in the form of normal matter (e.g atoms, protons, neutrons etc). As brown dwarfs are made of these things, they can only <em>contribute</em> to this small percentage and cannot be responsible for most of the dark matter (the same is true for anything made of normal, ""baryonic matter"").</p></li>
<li><p>Astronomers have <em>counted</em> how many brown dwarfs there are, both in the local neighbourhood and in star clusters (see for example <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...683L.183A"">Andersen et al. 2008</a>;  <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..197...19K"">Kirkpatrick et al. 2011</a>; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..197...19K"">Burningham et al. 2013</a>; . In other words we <em>can</em> see brown dwarfs - they emit most of their light in the infrared part of the spectrum, and surveys like SDSS, 2MASS and WISE have uncovered them in their thousands. It turns out that there is about 1 brown dwarf for every 4 more massive stars. So, although numerous, they contribute a very tiny fraction of the normal matter in our Galaxy. In addition, microlensing experiments towards the Galactic bulge and Magellanic clouds suggest that although there are lots of brown dwarfs elsewhere in our Galaxy (e.g. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...542..281A"">Alcock et al. 2000</a>; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...480..723C"">Novati et al. 2008</a>), there are not enough to make much of a contribution to dark matter, and so the results from our solar neighbourhood appear representative of the Galaxy as a whole.</p></li>

"How does gravity interact with a photon?","1249","","<p>If photon is mass-less and gravity can interact only with matter, then how  does gravity alter the trajectory of light?</p>
","<p>It is simply not true that gravity can only interact with mass. Rather, any long-range spin-2 force interacts with all energy-momentum equally, and it source is the stress-energy-momentum tensor. That is one way to state the equivalence principle.</p>

<p>Note that a massive object in its own rest frame has an associated energy $E = mc^2$, which under ordinary conditions is usually much higher than any stress terms (including pressure) or momentum (outside the rest frame). Thus one can usually pretend that gravity couples to mass, but it isn't so--rather, the gravitational charge is energy, and the entire stress-energy-momentum tensor couples to the gravitational field. This is analogous to how for electromagnetism, there is electric charge, but the electric currents also make a difference.</p>

<p>In the weak-field limit of general relativity, one can consider the fact that light is gravitationally deflected twice as much as a naive Newtonian prediction would be (for an object at the speed of light under Newtonian mechanics, that is) as the fault of light putting a pressure in the direction of its propagation equal to its energy density. But in general, the motion of a test particle is determined by its four-velocity and the geometry of spacetime <em>only</em>, and the light would just be a special case of having a 'lightlike' four-velocity.</p>

"Do all planets have a van Allen radiation belt?","1243","","<p>Earth has the van Allen radiation belts. Which other planets have one? Can it be determined if distant planets in other solar systems have one? </p>
","<p>Mars does not have a magnetic field of any strength and so does not have a van Allen belt (and this is a serious problem for potential human exploration of the planet). Similarly, neither Venus nor Mercury (nor the Moon, which is arguably part of a two-planet system with the Earth) have a van Allen belt.</p>

<p>The gaseous giants do, however, have radiation belts which are analogous to Earth's van Allen belt.</p>

<p>Spotting aurorae on distant exoplanets would be an indication of a strong magnetic field and thus of the likelihood of a radiation belt. I am not aware that such aurorae have been detected but distant aurorae have been seen around a brown dwarf - a substellar object somewhat bigger than a planet (see <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/29/astronomers-find-aurora-a-million-times-brighter-than-the-northern-lights"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/29/astronomers-find-aurora-a-million-times-brighter-than-the-northern-lights</a>).</p>

How many galaxies is the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall believed to contain?</p>
","<p>I'm sorry for the long answer. The result is in the bottom. :)</p>

<p>The number of galaxies in the ""wall"", as in any volume of space, is the number density $n_{\mathrm{gal}}$ times its volume $V_{\mathrm{wall}}$. However, the number density of galaxies depends on their masses/sizes: Small galaxies are much more common than large galaxies. Usually we describe this by the <em>halo mass function</em> (HMF), which gives the (differential) number density dN/dM of dark matter halos hosting galaxies as a function of halo mass M. Depending on your favorite cosmology, it looks something like this (created with <a href=""http://hmf.icrar.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> tool):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R7qSk.png"" alt=""Halo mass function""></p>

<p>The solid line shows the HMF <em>today</em> in the local Universe, i.e. at redshift zero, while the dashed and dotted line shows how it was at redshift 1.6 and 2.1, respectively, roughly 10 billion years ago, which mark the beginning and end of the wall (according to <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...561L..12H"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Horváth et al. 2014, A&amp;A, 561, L12</a>). Notice how the number of large halos grow with time, at the expense of small halos. This is due to the smaller ones accreting onto larger ones.</p>

<p>The HMFs are characterized by a power law at low masses with an exponential cut-off at high masses. To get the <em>total</em> number density we need to integrate over the entire range of masses, and here comes the problem: Whereas the upper limit is set by the maximum size a galaxy can have (roughly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_galaxies"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">$3\times10^{13}M_\odot$</a>, but the exact number isn't very important, as these galaxies are so rare), the lower limit depends on your definition of a galaxy. Large galaxies have smaller galaxies orbiting as satellites, and there isn't a well-defined threshold for when a clump of gas, stars, and dark matter is called a galaxy. <a href=""http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/space/stories/just-how-big-is-the-smallest-galaxy-in-the-universe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">These guys</a> report on the detection of a $\sim10^3M_\odot$ clump which they call a galaxy. That's probably not what you think of as a galaxy, so for the sake of this exercise, let's use Small Magellanic Cloud-sized galaxies as our lower minimum, i.e $\sim 6.5\times10^9 M_\odot$.</p>

<p>The total number density of galaxies is thus found by integrating the HMF. Luckily, the online HMF tool can do that as well. The result, i.e. <em>the number density of halos above a given mass</em>, looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DqQlq.png"" alt=""Cumulative HMF""></p>

<p>Note that the $x$ axis is given in terms of $h^{-1}M_\odot$. Since $h \simeq 0.7$, the mass of the SMC is $M_\mathrm{SMC} \simeq 5\times10^9 h^{-1}M_\odot$. From the graph, the number density of these objects is $\sim0.5\,h^{-3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3} = 0.17\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ (1 Mpc, or megaparsec, equals 3.26 million lightyears). In principle we should subtract the number density of halos above $3\times10^{13}M_\odot$, but since these are four orders of magnitude smaller, they can be neglected.</p>

<p>The wall starts at redshift ~1.6 and ends at redshift ~2.1. This translates into starting at a distance of 4.65 Gpc (billion parsec) and ending at 5.47 Gpc, i.e. a depth of ~800 Mpc. These numbers are in <em>comoving</em> coordinates, i.e. what it has expanded to today, as opposed to <em>physical</em> coordinates, i.e. what it was at the time it emitted the light that we see today. But the HMF is given in terms of comoving volume, so that's cool.</p>

<p>To get the volume, we also need the area. The finders report that it's roughly 2 Gpc times 3 Gpc, but they don't seem to state whether this is in physical or comoving coordinates (which differ by a factor (1+z) ~ 3). I suspect it's comoving, though.</p>

<p>Thus, the total volume is $V_{\mathrm{wall}} = 0.8 \times 2 \times 3\,\mathrm{Gpc}^3 = 4.8\,\mathrm{Gpc}^3 = 4.8\times10^9\,\mathrm{Mpc}^3$, or 166 cubic gigalightyears. Here, I have ignored the fact that the physical area spanned by the angle of observation is a bit different at the front and the back of the wall, but since these numbers are already quite uncertain, it's of lesser importance.</p>

<p>The considerations above are all for the average Universe. But the wall represents an <em>overdensity</em> in space, so the number will be larger. I can't find any estimates of the overdensity of this particular supercluster, but in general galaxies in superclusters are more numerous by a factor of $\delta \sim 5$–$10$. Let's use 5.</p>

<p>That is, <strong>the total number of galaxies the size of the Small Magellanic Cloud or above is</strong>
$$N_\mathrm{gal,tot} = n_\mathrm{gal} \times V_\mathrm{wall} \times \delta$$
$$= 0.17\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3} \times 4.8\times10^9\,\mathrm{Mpc}^3 \times 5$$
$$\sim 4 \mathrm{\,billion\,galaxies}.$$</p>

<p>But if you go through the same exercise for halos of masses above, say, $10^3\,M_\odot$, you'll find a number which is a million times larger.</p>

<p>In reality, the number density of <em>luminous</em> galaxies is smaller. At the high-mass end, the gas has trouble cooling sufficiently to condense and create stars, and active galactic nuclei in massive galaxies heat the gas. At the low-mass end, gas is more easily blown out of the potential well by stellar feedback from supernovae.</p>

<p>Why does this happen? Is this because of our atmosphere? Would they twinkle if you were just in space? How about looking from another planet in our solar system?</p>
","<p>Stars tend to twinkle for two main reasons: first, stars are very far away (the closest star is about 4 light-year from the Sun) and are therefore seen as point sources. Second, Earth has an atmosphere. Earth's atmosphere is turbulent, and therefore all images view through it tends to ""swim"". Therefore, sometimes a single point in ""object space"" is mapped to several points in ""image space"", and sometimes it is not mapped at all. Since stars are seen as single points, they sometimes seems brighter, sometimes even seems to disapear.</p>

<p>If you look at it in another planet of our solar system, it will depends on the planet's own atmosphere. If you look at stars on Mars, the atmosphere being very thin, the stars won't twinkle that much. Same for Mercury.

This mount is rated for 6 KG, almost three times the actual weight of the binoculars. With high-powered binoculars the aim must be adjusted every minute or so, therefore you will want an easy to adjust mount that is far from the limits of its capacity. You really can't beat the ball and socket design for this purpose in my opinion. I need to photograph the setup for <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/7917/what-should-i-look-for-in-an-astronomy-tripod/7919#7919"">another question</a> and when I do I'll check what model the tripod is.</p>

<p>Look also at the tripod of the user who asked the above-linked question. These large binoculars need the absolute heaviest duty tripod that you can reasonably afford. You will need <strong>all-metal construction</strong> and I would suggest a hook as well to hang a weight from, this will make the tripod steadier. You will have a hard time going overboard, so if you find two tripods with a similar price but one is heavier-duty, get that one.</p>

Its baseline is 2 AU; $2.3\times10^{4}$ times larger than the diameter of Earth.

<p>This ignores small complications such as the atmosphere, but if you're willing to put them outside the atmosphere, you could do it. Of course, it would sort of be a waste of time, since we already know the distances to the nearest stars, but hey, go ahead.</p>

Eclipses happen on Earth when the Earth is lined up below the Moon's Umbra.

<p><strong>Rogue Planet</strong></p>

<p>Your scenario mentioned planet-like.  Now, if it's a planet from our solar-system, that would imply disturbing the orbits of Earth/Venus/Moon, which you specified you didn't want.   There's also real danger if you were to have a planet like object in a near Earth orbit that passes from time to time, close enough to cast it's Umbra over Earth.   For safety reasons ""just passing through"" is the way to go.  </p>

<p>A rogue planet on a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hyperbolic trajectory</a> past the sun that, by very rare coincidence, passes between the Earth and the Sun, but close enough to cast it's Umbra over Earth would be very rare to say the least, but a theoretically possible scenario to cast a total eclipse over Earth, but it would need to pass very close and at just the right angle to block the 1/2 of 1 degree of arc that the Sun takes up in the sky.</p>

<p><strong>How close?</strong></p>

<p>Mars is roughly twice the diameter of the Moon, so would need to pass within about 750,000 km to the earth, and line up just right, to cast a tiny umbra that moved across the Earth.   </p>

<p>Venus, about 3.5 times the diameter, about 1.3 million km</p>

<p>Jupiter, about 41 times the diameter of the moon, would need to pass within about 15 million KM to cast an umbra on the Earth of similar size to the typical Moon's eclipse Umbra.</p>

<p>And those are the minimum distances.  You'd need the theoretical planet to be pretty well inside those limits to have an Umbra of significant size and for a 3 hour eclipse, bigger is better. </p>

<p><strong>What would a rogue planet passing that close look like?</strong>   </p>

<p>Consider that it's passing close enough that it looks larger than the Moon, at least for a 3-plus hours.   How close it would need to be depends on the size, as noted above.</p>

<p>The minimum velocity for an object on a hyperbolic trajectory just passing through the solar system but near Earth distance would be Earth's escape velocity, or the orbital velocity of the Earth (108,000 kph) times the square root of 2, and if it approached on the same plane and in the same direction as the Earth, the relative velocity between this Rogue planet and Earth, the minimum relative velocity would be about 45,000 kph, give or take.   That's absolute bare minimum as a theoretical rogue planet passing inside the Earth's orbit would usually be traveling a fair bit faster than that.</p>

<p>So, for a planet like that to remain between the Earth and the Sun for 3 hours, it would need to be about 3 times 45,000 km in diameter, or, nearly the size of Jupiter.</p>

<p>A small rogue planet couldn't cast an Umbra over Earth anywhere close to 3 hours because it would pass over the Earth much too quickly.   A Jupiter-sized Rogue planet could, theoretically, if it was closer than closer than 15 million km, cast it's umbra over Earth for 3 hours or so, but that would be close enough to change the Earth's orbit and, at the very least, give the Earth significant climate change by pushing the Earth a few million km either closer or further from the sun.    Not an ideal scenario.  </p>

<p>So there's no scenario that does what you ask.  You'd need a planet the size of Jupiter, with the mass of Neptune or perhaps less to leave the Earth/Moon undisturbed.    A Neptune mass planet with a large ring system . . . just maybe.   But given how rare your scenario is to begin with, I'm going to say basically no.   You could do it, but it would change the Earth's orbit, or you could do it with a smaller planet but for much less than 3 hours.  In any case, it would be a preposterously rare scenario no matter what.  </p>

<p><strong>What if we move the Moon?</strong></p>

<p>With rogue planets, I just looked at the relative velocity between the planets, which is close enough for a near-sighted umpire.  When you look at the Moon's umbra, the Moon's motion is much slower, so you also have to take into account the Earth's rotation too.</p>

<p>The Moon (Synodic period), takes 59 minutes to cross the sun, that's tip to full cover, and another 59 minutes back to tip.  (based on a 29.5 day synodic orbit, 29.5 days to cover 360 degrees, the sun, roughly 1/2 of 1 degree in the sky).   So, 158 minutes of partial eclipse, and a record, of 7 minutes total eclipse in one spot on Earth (7 minutes, the record for a total eclipse is possible when the Moon is slightly larger than the sun, close to it's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">perigee</a>).</p>

<p>So if our mad scientists pull the moon closer to the Earth, the period of time for a total eclipse increases but the rate that the Moon moves across the sun also increases, so you're effectively increasing the 7 minutes of total but decreasing the 158 minutes of partial.   If you pull the Moon all the way into a geostationary orbit, some 10.5 times closer, the Moon would span an enormous 5.25% of the sky, but it wouldn't move in the sky while the sun would and the sun, which crosses about 1 degree of sky in 4 minutes would pass behind the enormous geo-stationary moon in just 21 minutes.   You can't create a 3 hour eclipse by pulling the Moon closer.</p>

<p>This is where the Earth' rotation speed comes in.  The Moon moves over the Earth in it's orbit at about 3,683 kph, and relative to the sun, but because the Earth is in orbit to, the effective velocity relative to the sun (<a href=""https://community.dur.ac.uk/john.lucey/users/lunar_sid_syn.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Synodic</a> not sidereal) is about 8% less.</p>

<p>The Moon's umbra effectively moves with the Moon's relative velocity - at least, close enough.</p>

<p>The Earth rotates in the same direction that the Moon moves, peak velocity at the equator of a bit over 1,600 kph.   In effect, the rotation of the Earth tries to keep up with the movement of the Umbra during an eclipse, but the Umbra moves West to East about twice as fast as the Earth turns West to East.</p>

<p>So the solution for your 3 hour eclipse?   Make the Moon bigger and push it further away so it orbits the Earth more slowly and it's Umbra moves closer to the Earth's rotation speed, making a 3 hour eclipse, at mid day, close to the equator . . . possible.   </p>

<p>If we replace the Moon with Venus (3.5 times the diameter of the Moon) and we push it some 3 times further away (which would be pushing the limits of the stability of the Earth's hill sphere), then you'd be a lot closer, as our new ""Venus Moon"" would move across the sky and across the sun still to fast, but it would move more slowly and closer to Earth's rotational velocity leading to eclipses that stayed in the sky much longer.  If you did that, you might get your 3 hours of total eclipse.  You wouldn't want to push Venus too far, cause you'd want it a big bigger than the Sun in the sky, but 3 times the Moons distance, it would be about 15% larger and close to the limit of orbital stability.</p>

<p><strong>Other silly ideas.</strong></p>

<p>Now if you were to Move the Planet Uranus into Earth's L1 Trojan point, which . . . well, the Trojan point would be further away due to the larger planet's mass dominating so . . . that won't work and because L1 points aren't stable, it would also be highly dangerous.   Moving on.</p>

<p>If you were to move Uranus to where the Earth is and make the Earth a satellite of Uranus . . . we might get longer than 3 hour eclipses every time we were on the far side of Uranus making an orbit.   Seems a lot of work though just for an eclipse. . . . but that would work too.</p>

<p>OK, I'll stop now.</p>

"How did the reionization epoch make the universe ""transparent""?","1189","","<p>I've been reading about the reionization epoch of the universe, and it isn't entirely clear to me.  </p>

<p>As I understand it, very shortly after the big bang the universe was ionized, with the electrons stripped from the protons of hydrogen. The way that it's described is that the universe was ""opaque"" (since it was filled with ionized gas). Then the universe cooled enough for neutral hydrogen to form again, and the universe became ""transparent"". When the first stars and galaxies began to form they reionized the universe.  </p>

<p>What I don't understand is that in illustrations of this reionization, during the reionization epoch, it seems that the universe isn't transparent, but filled with unionized IGM (neutral hydrogen). Then the ionizing radiation from the newly formed stars ionizes the medium and ... these bubbles of ionized regions grow and merge until the entire universe is ionized again (and is therefore transparent).   </p>

<p>Have I misunderstood when the universe is transparent? Or the definition of transparent? Would it be accurate to say that the present day universe is completely ionized? (Does this just mean that most matter is in the form of stars which can be considered ionized? Since it doesn't really seem immediately evident in everyday life that ""everything is ionized"")</p>
","<p>Nowadays, the universe is mostly ionized, and transparent.</p>

<p>Transparent means that photons are able to travel long distances.</p>

<p>So there comes the confusion: <em>How could it be that recombination made the Universe transparent, and reionization keep it transparent?</em></p>

<p>After the Big Bang we had a very small Universe, filled with ionized matter. That amount of ionized matter caused the photons to be short-lived, and thus the Universe were opaque.</p>

<p>Then it came the recombination, and most baryonic matter became neutral, the photons were able to travel long distances, and the Universe thus became transparent.</p>

<p><strong>And it was expanding. And at the same time clusters of matter were collapsing.</strong></p>

<p>The combination of these two factors made the intergalactic medium density to fall a lot. Not only were there much more space for the same matter, but also the matter was concentrated in small bunchs making almost all the space almost empty.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second phase change occurred once objects started to condense in the early universe that were energetic enough to ionize neutral hydrogen. As these objects formed and radiated energy, the universe reverted from being neutral, to once again being an ionized plasma. This occurred between 150 million and one billion years after the Big Bang (at a redshift 6 &lt; z &lt; 20). At that time, however, matter had been diffused by the expansion of the universe, and the scattering interactions of photons and electrons were much less frequent than before electron-proton recombination. Thus a universe full of low density ionized hydrogen will remain transparent, as is the case today. [1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when the clusters of matter collapsed enough to become galaxies with stars and these stars reionized the intergallactic medium, there were almost no matter there, so photons continued being free to travel without obstacles, and so the Universe remained transparent.</p>

<p>So, it has been transparent for two different reasons: neutrality of matter, after the recombination, and scarcity of matter, after the reionization.</p>

"How much clearer are stars in earths orbit?","1178","","<p>As a child I remember my parents taking camping in California, and upon stepping out of the car I was awestruck at how thick the Milky Way galaxy was and at the number of stars everywhere. I've always wondered how much clearer it could get. What percentage of visible light from stars are absorbed by all of earths atmosphere at the clearest locations on earth? Are we taking about a small percentage or perhaps a significant amount?</p>
","<p>It varies.</p>

<p>The best astronomical sites have a visual band extinction of 0.1 mag, which means that only $\sim 10$ per cent of light is absorbed/scattered in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>In dusty, smoggy or polluted sites, this can easily reach one magnitude of extinction, which means that 60 per cent of the light is scattered.</p>

<p>These numbers are <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_(astronomy)"">per airmass</a></em> - which means looking straight up at zenith. At lower altitudes, the baseline extinction figure would be multiplied by $\sec z$ where $z$ is the angle from the zenith.</p>

<p>This amount of absorption doesn't sound like a huge difference, but what it means is that a large number of extra stars become visible, because roughly-speaking, you get a factor of two increase in the number of stars for every 0.5 magnitudes deeper you can see, and I think that is what is most striking about going to a clear, dark astronomical site.</p>

<p>Thus there wouldn't be <em>much</em> of an improvement going into space over the best astronomical sites (<em>in the visible band</em>), at least not due to the decrease in extinction. You do also escape light pollution, which is a different effect. With light pollution it is the fact that the background sky becomes too bright for your eye to pick up the fainter stars.

"Does the age of the universe take into account General Relativity / Special Relativity?","1171","","<p>It is generally accepted that the age of the universe is approximately 12-15 billion years old based on the speed of the expansion of the universe. Since everything is moving <em>very</em> fast away from us, doesn't relativistic effects from high speeds come into play here? If something is moving quite fast, time slows down, affecting how ""old"" it is. Is all this taken into account when calculating the age of the universe? I don't know if I'm making any sense to anyone else or not. </p>
","<p>Rob Jeffries gives a good response to this question, but I wanted to go through the basic outline of how the age of the universe is calculated, just so you can see how it works more or less. Be warned though, I'm only giving you the highlights and you'll either have to accept what I'm saying or fill in the blanks yourself.</p>

<p><strong>The Friedmann Equation</strong></p>

<p>As with anything in physics, when you want to analyze something, you need an equation to represent it. Think of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations"">Friedmann Equation</a> as the ""equation of the universe"". It's kind of crazy (to me) to believe, but yes there is an equation that represents the entire universe. The Friedmann equation is directly derived from the GR field equations, however it is quite possible to derive them from Newtonian mechanics (and a little hand waving). A good source for the Newtonian derivation can be found in Ryden's <a href=""http://atlas.physics.arizona.edu/~kjohns/downloads/lsst/Ryden_IntroCosmo.pdf"">Indroduction to Cosmology</a>, which is a good undergraduate level cosmology textbook.</p>

<p>There are many forms of the Friedmann equation<sup>1</sup> and it can be represented numerous ways (especially depending on the universe model), but I think a convenient form is the following:</p>

<p>$$\bigg(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\bigg)^2 = H_0^2 \Big(\Omega_{m,0}a^{-3} + \Omega_{r,0}a^{-4} + \Omega_{\Lambda,0} + \Omega_{k,0}a^{-2}\Big) \equiv H_0^2E^2(a)$$</p>

<p>The terms in this equation are defined as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>$a(t)$ The size of the universe at time $t$, compared to its size now.</li>
<li>$H_0$ The value of Hubble's constant for the current time. Nominally taken to be $\sim68\:\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</li>
<li>$\Omega$ The ""density"" of the various types of matter/energy in our universe. The subscript $0$ indicates that it is the density for the universe at the present time. For these, $m$ represents matter (both normal and dark), $r$ represents radiation (i.e., light), $\Lambda$ represents the cosmological constant (i.e., vacuum energy), and $k$ is the curvature of our universe (i.e. energy in the space-time fabric itself).</li>
</ul>

<p>This equation may seem scary, but effectively it is telling you is how the size of the universe, has evolved over time based on the current content of the universe. If you know precisely how much matter, radiation, and dark energy you have in the universe right now (or more precisely the density), you can calculate the history of the universe!</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><sub>Technically there is more than one equation, but we'll look at an important form of one of them.</sub></p>

<p><strong>The Age of the Universe</strong></p>

<p>Remember, $a$ is a function of time in the equation above. This means, with a little bit of rearranging and integrating, we can calculate the age of the universe.</p>

<p>$$t=\frac{1}{H_0} \int_{0}^{1} \Big(\Omega_{m,0}a^{-1} + \Omega_{r,0}a^{-2} + \Omega_{\Lambda,0}a^2 + \Omega_{k,0}\Big)^{-1/2} da$$</p>

<p>To calculate the age of the universe, $t$, you have the non-trivial task of measuring good values for the constants and then doing the integral above.</p>

<p>As a trivial case, you can assume we live in a flat, matter-only universe - no light, no dark energy, no curvature. In that case $\Omega_{m,0}=1$ and $\Omega_{r,0}=\Omega_{\Lambda,0}=\Omega_{k,0}=0$. You'll wind up with $t=2/(3H_0)$ which amounts to ~10 billion years old. This type of universe is known as an Einstein-de Sitter Universe and is obviously <em>not</em> the universe we live in.</p>

<p><strong>A Note on Dark Energy</strong></p>

<p>Technically the equations above are a bit more complicated because I haven't accounted for dark energy. I won't go into the specifics, but one can choose to add components to the equation above which include the dark energy equation of state parameter. Generally this parameter is denoted by $w$. The concepts are more or less the same, the equations just become uglier.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>With all of the above, I think I can really address your question. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does the age of the universe take into account GR/SR?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, yes. The Friedmann equation, as I said above, is derived directly from the GR equations. Therefore, we're using an equation to represent the universe which directly results from assuming GR is an accurate theory of gravity in our universe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since everything is moving very fast away from us, doesn't relativistic effects from high speeds come into play here? If something is moving quite fast, time slows down, affecting how ""old"" it is. Is all this taken into account when calculating the age of the universe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no. As I said, the age of the universe is ultimately derived from GR so anything GR/SR related is accounted for. However, it seems to me that your understanding of how the universe's age is calculated is somewhat simplistic (and there's nothing wrong with that - its a complicated process!). In calculating the age of the universe, we actually don't care about how fast some far-flung galaxy may be moving away from us. We don't even look at those galaxies. What we really look at is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation. By looking at this radiation, we're able to work out the $\Omega$ parameters more or less (and the dark energy parameter $w$) without every having to concern ourselves with recessional galaxy speeds. Hopefully you can see that the concepts of receding galaxies and time dilation are moot points when it comes to determining the age of the universe.</p>

"Why is the moon a fuzzy, white ball?","1171","","<p>I currently own a telescope, I'm an amateur astronomer and currently just trying to view the moon. I own the Celestron PowerSeeker 70AZ. </p>

<p>The problem: I can't view the moon! All I see is a big ball of white, and since I'm new I thought I could get some advice for eyepieces:  mine being a regular 20mm eyepiece. I don't use a barlow lens, mine broke.</p>

<p>Thanks! If you want any more specifications, just ask. I'm just looking for help! Thanks!</p>
","<p>Your telescope is not focused (most likely), or is having some major collimation issues (less likely).</p>

<p>Try and move the eyepiece back and forth a little. Go through the whole range of the focuser. You must catch the primary focal plane in order for the image to become clear.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, pull the eyepiece out a few mm and try to move through the whole range again.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, try a different eyepiece.</p>

<hr>

<p>The ""advice"" regarding the Moon filter is bogus. Be careful regarding what you hear on the Internet. The eye is certainly capable of adapting to various levels of brightness. Even with very large telescopes, the Moon filter is useless. All it does is reduce the brightness and contrast - the former is no big deal, but the latter is a major loss. You can never have enough contrast in a telescope.</p>

<p>When the Moon is visible, there's no point in going through deep dark adaptation anyway, because the ""faint fuzzies"" are obscured by Moon's glare. When I watch the Moon, I do it from a fully illumined backyard, or even on the street under the street lights. In fact, this is the best way to observe this object - no filters, but have some ambient light around you. Your eyes will function at optimal parameters.</p>

<p>Deep dark adaptation is only needed when observing faint nebulae and galaxies. But such objects can be observed in good conditions only when the Moon is below horizon.</p>

<p>Let me make it clear: <strong>a filter, any filter, will not fix the problem you're having</strong>, because it does not address the root cause.</p>

<p>Beware of most cases <strong>when the advice you receive is ""use a filter"". In 99% of cases, it's bogus.</strong> Many people own filters, but only a very small fraction know how to use them. In the vast, vast majority of cases you don't need any filters. Please steer clear of this superstition. It's a fad that vendors are more than happy to feed, because it makes them money.</p>

<p>There are legitimate ways to use filters (in the rare cases when they're justified), but that would be the subject of a different discussion - those rare cases are related to certain techniques of increasing the apparent contrast in the image. A neutral density filter (a.k.a. ""moon filter"") always decreases apparent contrast.</p>

<p>In this hobby, like in most other hobbies, a lot of people fixate on purchasing all sorts of accessories (in this case: filters), hoping to get extra performance, when all they need to do in reality is learn how to use the device / machine / etc (in this case: telescope) correctly. I see this tendency in all my other hobbies. It's unfortunate, and a huge money sink.</p>

<p>Save the money and use it instead towards purchasing a better telescope, or better eyepieces, or a good sky atlas, or an observing chair, etc.</p>

"How do astronomer measures the size of any celestial objects?","1170","","<p>What techniques and tools are available to the astronomers to measure the size of any celestial objects such as, stars or perhaps black holes that doesn't emit light nor reflects starlight?</p>
","<p>If a celestial body is larger than the resolving power of a telescope, its size can be measured directly. This is the case for most galaxies, molecular clouds in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, and even for a few nearby stars. EDIT: See discussion by Rob Jeffries on how these measurements are carried out for stars using interferometry.</p>

<p>For more distant stars, we can rely on our understanding of stellar evolution, which tells us pretty accurately the radius, once we know its spectrum (EDIT: or just a assume blackbody radiation and use the formula given by Rob). If the star is a member of a binary system whose orbit we observe roughy edge-on, we can measure how the luminosity declines as one star occults the other, and calculate the radius. This can also be used to measure the sizes of exoplanet. And for stars, the same technique is even possible using our own Moon as occulter. See a description <a href=""http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys440/lectures/size/size.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Black holes (BH) that don't emit light, cannot be measured (at least not until we are able to detect gravitational waves), but often BHs are surrounded by a disk of accreting gas, which is heated to million of degrees by friction as it spirals down the drain. Measuring the temperature of this gas tells us the mass of the BH, which is directly proportional to its radius ($R_{\mathrm{BH}} \simeq 3 M/M_\odot$ km).</p>

<p>A nice technique for measuring the size of the quite small region of gas clouds around a supermassive BHs, even though they are billions of lightyears away, is called <em>reverberation mapping</em>. Here, some of the light emitted from the BH's accretion disk travels directly in our direction, while some of if travels in other directions, illuminating the clouds around it. When we measure the light from those clouds, the signal looks like the directly observed signal, but with a delay $t$ corresponding to extra length of the path that the light has taken. Since we know the speed of light $c$, we can calculate the extra distance as $d = ct$, i.e. the size of the system.

<p>The answers there clearly sum up the question asked. But Milky Way is not just a spiral galaxy. It is further classified as a <strong>barred</strong> spiral galaxy.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which particular feature in the distribution of stars, or in general a feature in observations led us to believe that it is a barred galaxy?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The edge-on picture is not sufficient to establish it, since a dense distribution at smaller radii could also arise from a non-uniform density on the spiral disk if modeled to fit the observations. We don't have any data from other angles or orientations.</p>
","<p>There are several different lines of evidence which together form a coherent picture: that of a barred galaxy. Moreover, as most disc galaxies are barred, we should expect the same from the Milky Way. The various evidences are:</p>

<p>The observed light distribution (2MASS) shows a left-right assymmetry in brightness and the vertical height. This is explained by the near end of the bar being located on that side.</p>

<p>The observed gas velocities show velocities which are ""forbidden"" in an axisymmetric or near-axisymmetric (spiral arms only) galaxy. These velocities occur naturally from the orbits of gas in a barred potential</p>

<p>The velocity distribution of stars in the Solar neighbourhood shows some asymmetries and clumping which is most naturally explained by orbital resonance with the bar rotation.</p>

<p>The extent, pattern speed, and orientation of the bar is consistent between all three of these.</p>

"In km/h, what actually is the ""speed"" of Andromeda away from us: cosmologically?","1170","","<p>Andromeda is about 2.5 million ly away.</p>

<p>Actually, in this universe, at what ""speed"" (in km/h) are two objects separating cosmologically - <strong>I mean strictly due to the ""expansion of the universe""</strong> - if they are 2.5 million ly apart?</p>

<p>I do understand that local ""ordinary"" or ""peculiar"" motion completely swamps this effect.  If I'm not mistaken, the ""local"" ""ordinary"" motion of Andromeda per our galaxy happens to be about 400,000 km/h towards us.</p>

<p>Is the ""speed"" due to the ""expansion of the universe"" drastically smaller than this?</p>

<hr>

<p>I assumed that the expansion of the universe (or ""of the spacetime metric"") is even everywhere: it's well known that it only affects ""the largest structures"" but I still assumed that the expansion is the same in my room, my galaxy, my cosmological region.  Perhaps this assumption is totally wrong?</p>
","<p>The rate of expansion, measured in the customary units of (km/s)/Megaparsec
is not known with great accuracy. Recent measurements include 67.6 (SDSS-III), 73(HST) 67.8 (Plank) 69.3 (WMAP) [<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law"">wikipedia</a>]</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy"">Andromeda galaxy</a> is 0.78 Mpc from us, so taking the Hubble constant to be about 70, gives a recession of about 55 km/s. This is not a very great speed: compare with the orbital velocity of the sun around the galaxy at over 200 km/s, or the escape velocity of the galaxy (over 500km/s)</p>

<p>As you note, this is pretty much swamped by the proper relative motion of our galaxies. Its blueshift indicates that Andromeda is approaching us at over 100 km/s. For galaxies outside of the the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group"">Local group</a>, the Hubble flow dominates.</p>

<p>Now the value of 55km/s assumes that space is smooth and homogeneous. This is approximately true on a universal scale, but it is not true on the scale of a galaxy cluster, where local gravitational effects dominate the curvature of spacetime. The general expansion of spacetime has very little effect on the motion of galaxies in the local group, as discussed by <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.1523v4.pdf"">Iorio's paper on the motion of a gravitationally bound binary system</a></p>

<p>At first approximation, the Hill sphere gives a radius in which orbits around a moon could be stable. Our Moon's Hill radius is 64000 km.<br>

Could we remove stars until the Magellanic clouds became star clusters, or is there something intrinsically galaxy like about these objects?  </p>
","<p>There are a couple of important distinctions between the two types of objects.

Jupiter is listed as having <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#Chemical_composition"">a very tiny trace amount</a> of Argon that is hard to interpret because it's listing it as relative to helium and then relative to Jupiter/Sun, whatever that means.

I'm also curious about where Argon lies in the ""food chain"" of nuclear fusion for an average star like our Sun. I have a hard time seeing how Argon-40 would be more populous than Neon-20 though.</p>
","<p>Doing a bit of reading up on this, I might have an answer, though credit where credit is due, the answer isn't really mine:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3wsy99/why_is_neon_so_rare_on_earth/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3wsy99/why_is_neon_so_rare_on_earth/</a></p>

<p>When the planets coalesced, it's likely that there was very little ices/gas around the inner planets when they formed and the Earth's atmosphere and water (CH4, NH3, CO2 and H20 being the 4 most common outside the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_%28astrophysics%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">frost line</a> ices).  These likely came from asteroids and meteors that formed outside the frost line and later crashed onto earth.</p>

<p>Neon is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">5th most common element</a> in the milky-way but because all noble gases have very low freezing points, it's likely not be very common even on comets or meteors for the same reason that water or CO2 aren't common inside the frost line, Neon, and other noble gases likely stay free and don't collect on comets or meteors in high amounts.   (I looked, but couldn't find an article to verify that).</p>

<p>But if comets have low noble gas content, then we have to look for an alternate source.  With that in mind, and going back to the first link, Argon is produced by radioactive decay of Potassium 40 and that would explain it's relative abundance compared to the more common noble gas, Neon.   Helium (Alpha particles) is also produced inside the earth and Radon is is too in small amounts but Radon also decays - that's not related to your question though.</p>

<p>If Argon on planets comes primarily from Potassium 40, you should expect the amount of Argon to have a roughly similar ratio to the amount of potassium on a planet and not be relative to the percentage of atmosphere.   A 2nd factor, how much gets blown off the planet over long periods of time is a factor too.   Venus in general should be able to retain much of it's Argon <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">based on atomic weight</a> (40) similar to CO2 (44), but if it loses even a tiny percentage of it's Argon over time, that would be a factor too.</p>

<p>Now, to see if this is possible, I should run some numbers, but I warn you, my math can be a little rusty.</p>

<p>Potassium is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth&#39;s_crust"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">7th most common</a> element in the Earth's lithosphere at about 0.26% and about 0.0117% of that Potassium is Potassium 40.   Using a <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-total-mass-of-the-Earths-crust"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very rough estimate</a> of $2.3 \times 10^{19}$ tonnes for the Earth's crust, $(2.3 \times 10^{19}) \times (2.5 \times 10^{-3}) \times (1.17 \times 10^{-4}) =$ about $6.7 \times 10^{12}$ or 6.7 trillion tons of Potassium 40 currently in the Earth's crust. (There's probably a fair bit more in the mantle, so these numbers are rough)</p>

<p>With a <a href=""https://www.cns-snc.ca/media/uploads/teachers/K40_4pg_10_06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">half life</a> of about 1.248 billion years, that's sufficient time for over 3 half lives if we start after the late heavy bombardment, which suggests a bit over 7/8ths of the original Potassium 40 in the Earth's crust has decayed into Argon 40, so there should be, given the age of the Earth and abundance of Potassium 40, a bit over 7 times 6.7 trillion tons or, lets ballpark and say a bit over 50 trillion tons of Argon that formed on earth by Potassium decay.  (I'm ignoring any that might have been produced prior to the late heavy bombardment, cause I assume that could have blown some of the atmosphere off the earth or heated the atmosphere enough for the sun to blow some of it off).    Also, doing a bit of research, only 11% of the Potassium 40 decays in to Argon 40, 89% undergoes beta decay into Calcium 40, so for this to work, there would need to be a fair bit more Potassium in the earth than I estimated, but that's still likely the case.</p>

<p>The mass of the atmosphere is about 5,140 trillion tons, and 1.288% of that (By mass, not volume) = about 66 trillion tons, so the Argon we should expect from Potassium 40 decay and the amount of Argon in the atmosphere are pretty close.   Some Argon gas might have escaped and some should still be trapped inside the earth but the numbers are close enough to work and I think that's very likely the answer.  It also suggests that the Earth has lost relatively little Argon to space, which also fits with the Atmospheric Escape article.</p>

<p>A 2nd way to look at this is that Argon 40 makes up 99.6% of the Argon in the atmosphere and Stellar Nucleosis likely wouldn't account for a ratio anywhere close to that (not a typical stellar link but <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40#Potassium.E2.80.93argon_dating"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> says Argon 36 is the most common isotope).   The decay of Potassium 40 does explain the 99.6% Argon40 ratio.</p>

<p>If we apply a similar estimate to Venus, with Venus atmosphere about 94 times the mass of Earth's, and we assume a similar amount of Argon-40 being produced in Venus' crust we could roughly expect 1.28%/60 or about 0.02% Argon by mass in Venus's atmosphere or perhaps, if the Earth lost a pretty high share of it's lighter crust elements after the giant impact, we might expect a bit more than that on Venus, perhaps 0.03% or 0.04% as a rough estimate.   Using your number of 0.007%, that's lower than I calculate it should be, but Venus could have lost a higher share of it's Argon than Earth and it also might be slower to release trapped gas inside it's crust than Earth because it doesn't have plate tectonics, so the number for Venus looks ""about right"" too.    It's the Potassium 40 in the crust.   I'm convinced.</p>

<p>So the answer appears to be yes, you can do it, assuming that page isn't a total fabrication. Seems plausible to me: the redshift of that quasar is sizable at 0.15 (though that's small for a quasar), which means that the spectral lines will be shifted by something like 15%. So you  don't need to have a very fine diffraction grating to see the shift. And <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_273"">that quasar</a> is pretty bright for a quasar, at magnitude 13, so you can easily spot it with a good scope. Sounds like a fun project!</p>

"Is there a limit to how hot a star can be?","1149","","<p>I think that <em>size</em> and <em>mass</em> do not correlate to <em>temperature</em>, but then again these factors contribute to the internal pressure. </p>

<p>I would like to know if there is a limit to <strong>how hot a star can get and what mechanism(s) could drive a star to get unusually hot</strong>. </p>

<p>I also know that negative temperature occurs in laser is hotter than a positive temperature, and can a star produce negative temperature?</p>
","<p>Yes, there is a limit. If the radiation pressure gradient exceeds the local density multiplied by the local gravity, then no equilibrium is possible.</p>

<p>Radiation pressure depends on the fourth power of temperature. Radiation pressure gradient therefore depends on the third power of temperature multiplied by the temperature gradient.</p>

<p>Hence for stability
$$ T^3 \frac{dT}{dr} \leq \alpha \rho g,$$
where $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the local gravity and $\alpha$ is some collection of physical constants, including how opaque the material is to radiation. Because there must be a temperature gradient in stars (they are hotter on the inside than the outside) this effectively puts an upper limit to the temperature. It is this that sets an upper limit of around 60,000-70,000 K to the surface temperature of the most massive stars, which are dominated by radiation pressure.</p>

<p>In regions of higher density or higher gravity, radiation pressure is not such an issue and temperatures can be much higher. The surface temperatures of White dwarf stars (high density and gravity) can be 100,000 K, the surfaces of neutron stars may exceed a million K.</p>

<p>Of course stellar interiors are much denser and consequently can be much hotter. The maximum temperatures there are controlled by how quickly heat can be moved outwards by radiation or convection. The very highest temperatures of $\sim 10^{11}$ K are reached at the centres of core-collapse supernovae. Ordinarily, these temperatures are unattainable in a star because cooling by neutrinos can carry energy away highly effectively. In the final seconds of a CCSn, the density gets high enough that neutrinos become trapped and so the gravitational potential energy released by the collapse cannot escape freely - hence the high temperatures.</p>

<p>As to the last part of your question, yes there are <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_maser"" rel=""nofollow"">astrophysical masers</a> found in the envelopes of some evolved stars.

"Is a black hole a perfect sphere?","1144","","<p>I know all about how black holes form and why their gravity is so strong. However, is the gravity equally powerful in all directions? Will the event horizon appear as a <strong>perfect</strong> sphere?</p>
","<p>You cannot see the event horizon. That being said:</p>

<p>A non-rotating black hole, free of external influences, has perfect spherical symmetry. All its properties are exactly the same in any direction, period. This is the Schwarzschild metric.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric</a></p>

"Can dark matter be found in the shape of planets, galaxies etc.?","1143","","<p>If dark matter has gravity just like normal matter, does that mean it can also form planets, solar systems and so on?
 Any answer will be appreciated.</p>
","<p>Planets and stars, no. Globular clusters and galaxies, yes.</p>

<h2>Small scales</h2>

<p>To condense into such relatively compact objects as planets, stars, and even the more diffuse star-forming clouds, particles need to be able to dissipate their energy. If they don't do this, their velocities prohibit them from forming anything.</p>

<p>""Normal"" particles, i.e. atoms, do this by colliding. When atoms collide, they're excited, and when they de-excite, they emit radiation which leaves the system, carrying away energy. In this way, an ensemble of particles can relax into a less energetic system, eventually condensing into e.g. a star. Additionally, the collisions cause more energetic particles to donate energy to the less energetic ones, making the ensemble reach <em>thermodynamic equilibrium</em>, i.e. all particles have the same energy on average.</p>

<p>Dark matter is, by definition, unable to collide and radiate, and hence, on such small scales as stars and planets, particles that enters a potential well with a given energy will maintain that energy. They will thus accelerate toward the center, then decelerate after its closest approach to the center, and finally leave the system with the same energy as before (if it was unbound to begin with). This makes it impossible for collisionless matter to form such small objects.</p>

<h2>Large scales</h2>

<p>On the scale of galaxies, however, various relaxation mechanisms allows dark matter to form structure. This is the reason that in pure N-body simulations of the Universe, such as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Run"">Millennium Simulation</a>, you will see galaxies. The sizes of these structures depend on the resolution, but are measured in millions of Solar masses.</p>

<p>The relaxation mechanisms include:</p>

<strong>Phase mixing</strong>

<p>This is sort of like galaxy arms winding up, but in phase space rather than real space.</p>

<strong>Chaotic mixing</strong>

<p>This happens when particles come so close that their trajectories diverge exponentially.</p>

<strong>Violent relaxation</strong>

<p>The two mechanisms listed above assume a constant gravitational potential $\Phi$, but as the systems relaxes, $\Phi$ changes, giving rise to an additional relaxation process. For instance, more massive particles tend to transfer more energy to their lighter neighbors and so become more tightly bound, sinking towards the center of the gravitational potential. This effect is known as mass segregation and is particularly important in the evolution of globular star clusters.</p>

<strong>Landau damping</strong>

<p>For a perturbation/wave with velocity $v_p$, if a particle comes with $v\gg v_p$, it will overtake the wave, first gaining energy as it falls into the potential, but later losing the same amount of energy as it climb up again. The same holds for particles with $v\ll v_p$ which are overtaken by the wave.
However, particles with $v\sim v_p$ (i.e. that are near resonance with the wave) may experience a net gain or loss in energy.
Consider a particle with $v$ slightly larger than $v_p$. Depending on its phase when interacting with the wave, it will be either accelerated and move away from resonance, or decelerated and move closer to resonance. The latter interact more effectively with the wave (i.e. be decelerated for a longer time), and on average there will thus be a net transfer of energy from particles with $v \gtrsim v_p$ to the wave. The opposite is true for particles with $v$ slightly smaller than $v_p$</p>

<p>The next best is GL710 a K-dwarf that will come within about 0.1-0.44pc in 1.3 million years.</p>

<p>On a statistical basis, some work has been done by <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001A%26A...379..634G"">Garcia Sanchez et al. (2001)</a>. They estimate, using the Hipparcos data, that encounters within 1pc occur every 2.3 million years. However, the Hipparcos data isn't complete for low-mass, faint objects. Making a correction for this, the authors estimate a $&lt;1pc$ encounter every 100,000 years. The probability for closer approaches scales as the inverse of the square of the separation. i.e. the timescales for approaches closer than 0.1pc is 100 times longer. </p>

<p>There are plenty of big error bars in all this work - recall that an error of 1km/s in velocity leads to a 1pc error in position after 1 million years. All this should be nailed down really well by Gaia results in the next 2-3 years.</p>

"How much mass does an object in space need to keep a human on its surface?","1112","","<p>Assume there were a roughly spherical object in space like a meteorite or a comet. </p>

<p>If I weighed 80kg on Earth, how much mass would be required for an object in space so that I could stay on its surface without ""flying away?"" It's not necessary have the same gravity as Earth, but I am wondering what minimal mass the object would require for it to have <em>meaningful</em> gravity for someone to remain on the surface.</p>
","<p>Any object with mass (even you) has gravity. The mutual attractive force between two objects is given by the formula
$$ F = G \frac{M_1 M_2}{R_{12}^2}, $$
where the two mass are $M_1$ and $M_2$ and $R_{12}$ is the separation of their centres of mass.</p>

<p>So to answer your question we need to define some sort of parameter that specifies what you mean by ""meaningful gravity"".</p>

<p>One way of doing this would be to demand that the forces due to tides from the Sun are greater than the gravitational force holding you to the body in question. Even here though we need to make an assumption about how far away the object is from the Sun - let it be $r$. Now let your mass be $m$, the mass of the body be $M$, the radius of the body be $R$, and the mass of the Sun be $M_{\odot}$.</p>

<p>To stay attached to the object when you are at the ""subsolar point"" - i.e. the body rotates so that you are closest to the Sun, then we require
$$G \frac{M m}{R^2} &gt; G \frac{m M_{\odot}}{(r-R)^2} - G\frac{m M_{\odot}}{r^2}$$</p>

<p>We can assume that $r \gg R$, so cancelling out $Gm$ and performing a binomial expansion on the middle term, keeping only the first two terms of the expansion:
$$\frac{M}{R^{2}} &gt; \frac{M_{\odot}}{r^{2}}(1 + \frac{2R}{r}) - \frac{M_{\odot}}{r^{2}}$$ 
$$ \frac{M}{R^{2}} &gt;  2M_{\odot}\frac{R}{r^3}$$
Thus this sets a limit on the <em>density</em> of the object in question
$$ \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} = \rho &gt; \frac{3}{2\pi} \frac{M_{\odot}}{r^3}$$</p>

<p>At $r=1\ au$, this means the density only needs to exceed $3 \times 10^{-4}$ kg/m$^3$, which will be satisfied by any solid body. NB: This limit would be a limit where you would actually be pulled from the surface by the Sun's tides.</p>

<p>A more stringent requirement might be to ensure that you can't <em>jump</em> off the surface. On Earth, an average person might be able to jump vertically about 50cm. Using the equations of uniform acceleration (SUVAT), we know $u^2 = 2g s$, where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, $s$ is the height jumped and $u$ is the initial upward velocity. This tells us that you can jump upwards at about 3m/s. Assuming this is the same on any other body (its hard to say how well you could jump in much lower gravity) you could equate this to the <em>escape velocity</em> of the object, given by $v_{esc} = (2GM/R)^{1/2}$. Thus this gives a constraint of $M/R &gt; u^2/2G$.</p>

<p>If we set a realistic density of $\rho = 5000$ kg/m$^{3}$ for an asteroid, we can replace $M$ with $4\pi R^{3} \rho/3$, to say that you would be able to jump off an asteroid if it were smaller than:
$$ R &lt; u \left(\frac{3}{8\pi G \rho}\right)^{1/2}$$
<strong>For the numbers discussed this means $R&lt; 1.8$ km</strong> and <strong>$M&lt;1.2\times 10^{14}$ kg</strong>.</p>

<p>What are all the intermediate subsystems up to motion around the center of the Milky Way?  </p>
","<p>The Sun is not within the gravitational sphere of influence of any other star. The centre of mass of the solar system (which is very close to the Sun) instead orbits in the general Galactic gravitational potential. Because this has a roughly cylindrical symmetry (the Galaxy is basically a disk with a bulge in the middle), this means that it executes a (roughly) circular orbit around the centre of the Galaxy, taking about 230 million years to do so. At the same time it is wobbling in the vertical plane of the Galactic disc, up and down with a cycle of about 70 million years (see <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/822/how-far-is-the-earth-sun-above-below-the-galactic-plane-and-is-it-heading-towar"">How far is the Earth/Sun above/below the galactic plane, and is it heading toward/away from it?</a> )</p>

<p>There is really nothing intermediate because the stars in the milky way form a ""collisionless system"" they don't really interact gravitationally on an individual basis. Stars can be influenced by perturbations in the smooth Galactic potential caused by massive star clusters, giant molecular clouds and spiral arms. This is thought to be why the velocity dispersions of stars around regular circular orbits increases with age.</p>

"How can neutron stars have gaseous atmospheres?","1092","","<p>Neutron stars can have small atmospheres. However, they also have extremely strong gravitationally pulls. Shouldn't the all the gas molecules be drawn to the star's surface, and become solids under the immense pressure?</p>

<p>Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way, but I don't see how it could be possible.</p>
","<p>Gravity is only important insofar that it is capable of compressing the material to high densities. Whether that material is capable of solidifying depends on the competition between Coulombic potential energy and the thermal energy of the particles. The former increases with density, the latter increases with temperature. A dense plasma can still be a gas if it is hot enough.</p>

<p>A rough formula for the exponential scale height of the atmosphere is
$$ h = \frac{kT}{\mu m_u g},$$
where $T$ is the temperature of the gas, $m_u$ is an atomic mass unit, $\mu$ is the number of atomic mass units per particle and $g$ is the surface gravity, with $g = GM/R^2$.</p>

<p>For a typical neutron star with $R=10$ km, $M= 1.4M_{\odot}$, we have $g=1.86\times 10^{12}$ m/s$^2$. The atmosphere could be a mixture of ionised helium ($\mu=4/3$) or perhaps iron ($\mu = 56/27$), so let's say $\mu=2$ for simplicity. The temperature at the surface of the neutron star will change with time; typically for a young pulsar, the surface temperature might be $10^{6}$ K.</p>

<p>This gives $h = 2$ mm.</p>

<p>Why is this not a ""solid""? Because the thermal energy of the particles is larger than the coulombic binding energy in any solid lattice that the ions could make. That is not the case in the solid surface below the atmosphere because the density grows very rapidly (from $10^{6}$ kg/m$^{3}$ to more than $10^{10}$ kg/m$^{3}$ (where solidification takes place) only a few cm in, because the scale height is so small. Of course the temperature increases too, but not by more than a factor of about 100. After that, the density is high enough for electron degeneracy, and the material becomes approximately isothermal and at a small depth the ""freezing temperature"" falls below the isothermal temperature.</p>

"How does a gravity slingshot actually work?","1091","","<p>From what I know of elliptical orbits, an object speeds up near the periapsis and slows down at the apoapsis, much like we learned in high school physics how a sphere would roll down and back up a valley in a frictionless vacuum: The height is inversely proportional to the speed.</p>

<p>The ""gravity slingshot"" maneuver we've seen in sci-fi and even used by our own spacecraft relies on the physics of hyperbolic orbits, where an object both enters and exits the orbit before making a single lap around the planet/moon/etc. Since gravity pushes the craft toward that body both while they're heading towards and away from it, <strong>shouldn't the craft's velocity be the same at</strong> (for example) <strong>1 megameter before the periapsis as 1 megameter after?</strong> If so, then the gravity slingshot maneuver should only have the end purpose of redirecting the craft's trajectory, not of increasing its speed, as the name implies.</p>

<p>My understanding in a simple diagram:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8fFCA.png"" alt=""Three gray dots signify a single object as it travels along a path that dips below a large blue circle signifying a large body. The first and third gray dots has a label declaring a speed of x, and the second dot has a label declaring a speed much greater than x""></p>
","<p>The diagram is in the rest frame of the planet. Now suppose a spacecraft is slowing down in the frame of the solar system. A planet is nearby, so it now starts accelerating due to its gravity and gains speed. Now, this speed increase is added to some component of the speed of the planet's motion when it comes out on the other side (this added component can be changed by changing the angle from which it approaches the planet, in order to maximize the slingshot effect). Once out of the planet's influence, the spacecraft has the same velocity as before, plus a component of the planet's motion, which allows it to travel farther out. This is the slingshot effect.</p>

<p>Trying to look at this in another way, consider the angular momentum of the spacecraft. As long as it is only under sun's gravitational influence, its angular momentum cannot change. However, once it's under the influence of another planet, the two angular momenta - one w.r.t. the sun and one w.r.t. the planet (due to their relative motion) - add, and once out of the gravitational influence of the planet, their relative components can be adjusted (based on the angle of approach towards the planet and the angle at which it flies away after the slingshot) in order to increase the angular momentum w.r.t. the sun, which in turn puts it in a larger orbit, allowing it to travel farther away than before.</p>

","<p>The coincidence isn't so much that they appear very similar sizes from Earth, but that we are alive to see them at the point in time in which they appear very similar sizes.  The moon is slowly moving away from the Earth, and at some point in the future the moon will be unable to totally eclipse the sun and conversely, if you could step far into prehistory, you would be able to see the moon with a much greater angular diameter than you see it now.</p>

<p>Most research I've found on the topic seem to be unavailable through my institute, however I did find one paper, <a href=""http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1973ApJ...180..307C/0000313.000.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Outcomes of tidal evolution""</a>, which references results from Goldreich's research on the subject.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>For reference, the Moon is currently at a distance of approximately 60.3 Earth radii.  As such, the moon will steadily move away until synchronism would be reached, and from that point begin to recede towards the Earth due to the tidal affects of the Sun on the Earth disturbing the synchronization. It would seem that at some eventual point in the far distant future, it will return to this coincidental position once again.</p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUD</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0407149v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Weisberg &amp; Taylor, 2004</a> present a graph showing the change in ""Cumulative Periastron Time Shift"" over a 30 year period.  Here is a later version of that graph

<p>The graph indicates excellent agreement between the observed data points and the theoretical curve predicted by the General Theory of Relativity (GTR).  </p>

<p>The authors determined the theoretical change in orbit period $P$ over time (due to orbital energy loss from emission of gravitational waves) from a formula (Peters
&amp; Matthews (1963)) of the form:-
$$ dP/dt = K/P^{(5/3)}$$ 
where K is an (effectively constant) function of the masses of the two stars and the orbit eccentricity. For the Hulse-Taylor Binary, the period $P$ is approximately 7.75 hours and the value of K is approximately $(-6 * 10^{-5})$, giving an approximate value of $$ dP/dt = 2.34 × 10^{−12} s/s. $$</p>

<p>If $dP/dt$ is constant then obviously we can determine the period $P$ at a future time by applying the formula
$$P_t = P_0 + t\,(dP/dt).$$
As a rough initial estimate over one year the approximate change in period is: 365.25 x 24 x 3600 x -2.34 x 10^{-12} = 0.074 ms. (Wikipedia article indicates 0.076 ms.)</p>

<p>But $dP/dT$ is not constant because it depends on the value of $P$ which obviously changes.  So we would expect the period to decay over time and the rate of decay to increase with time. However, the change in P is currently so very small that over the period of 30 years the change in dP/dt (which is a function of $P$) is extremely small also. (It is important to appreciate that the graph shown above does <strong>not</strong> plot $dP/dt$ against time).</p>

<p><strong>zibadawa timmy</strong> (thanks) provided the formula $P=(8/3 \int K dt)^{3/8}$ giving:- </p>

<p>$$
P_t = \left( \frac{8}{3} (Kt+C)\right)^{3/8} \qquad \mathrm{with}\qquad C=\frac{3}{8} P_o^{8/3}
$$</p>

<p>hence</p>

<p>$$
P_t = 
 \left( \frac{8}{3} Kt+ P_o^{8/3})\right)^{3/8} 
=
 \left(  \frac{-1.6\,t}{10^4}+ P_o^{8/3}\right)^{3/8} 
=
 \left(  \frac{-1.6\,t}{10^4}+ 27900^{8/3}\right)^{3/8} 
$$
for 1 year , t = 31,557,600 s., so -1.6 t/10^4 = -5,049.12 = c. 5e3</p>

<p>for 10 years t = 310,557,600 s., so -1.6 t/10^4 = -50,491.2 = c. 5e4</p>

<p>while 27900^{8/3} = 716,051,966,959.181 = c. 7e11.</p>

<p>So 
$$
P_{1 year} = (-5049.12 + 716,051,966,959.181)^{3/8} = 27,899.999 926 s,\qquad deltaP_{1 year} = -0.0000738 s.
$$
$$
P_{10 years} = (-50491.2 + 716,051,966,959.181)^{3/8} =  27,899.999 262 s,\qquad deltaP_{10 years} = -0.000738 s.
$$
These $deltaP$ values indicate that the value of $dP/dt$ is effectively constant ($=-0.000 073 8 s/s) over 10years.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION 1 - What is plotted on the graph? ($\equiv$ What is Cumulative Perihelion Time Shift?) (ANSWERED).</strong> </p>

<p>Initially I was confused about what the Weisberg &amp; Taylor graph was actually plotting.  The 2004 paper has ""The observed and theoretical decays are compared graphically in Figure 1"".  The wikipedia article labels the y-axis ""Cumulative Period Shift"" but the caption reads ""observed change in the epoch of periastron with date"".</p>

<p>An earlier <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v245/n4/pdf/scientificamerican1081-74.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1981 Scientific American article</a> indicates that
the vertical axis of the graph indicates the difference (round data points) between (A) the calculated epoch of a periastron event in a hypothetical ""steady"" system whose orbital period remains constant and (B) the observed epoch of the corresponding actual periastron event in the ""decaying""-period system. Also shown is the continuous curve showing the difference between (A) steady system periastron epochs and (C) theoretical predictions of decayed periastron epochs.   The periastron's of the actual and hypothetical orbits are synchronized at $t=0$ (in late 1974).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>QUESTION 2 - How are the theoretical values of CPTS Calculated? (ANSWERED).</strong></p>

<p>Several (similar) methods have now been identified.</p>

<p>Method 1 The method(s) used by Weisberg &amp; Taylor to calculate theoretical values of CPTS have not been identified. These following methods seem reasonable candidates, based on the agreement with their results.</p>

<p>Method 2 (see Stan Liou's answer)
<strong>Stan Liou</strong> has provided a formula $\Delta t = 0.5(\dot P/P_0)t^2$ that produces values which closely match the Weisberg &amp; Taylor graph.  </p>

<p>Method 3 (see my answer Method 3)
I have derived a formula identical to Stan Liou's but derived using phase instead of mean anomaly.  Another formula is derived from the same trunk expressing $\Delta t$ in terms of $\dot P, P and N$ $\Delta t = -0.5 P_o \dot P N^2$.</p>

<p>Method 4 (see my answer Method 4)
I have derived a formula derived using a coarsely approximated  binomial series which gives similar results 
$ \Delta t_{N} = P_0{\dot P} \frac{N^2+N}{2}  $.  </p>

<p>Method 5 (not shown)
A finely approximated series expansion approach has been assessed. For the given binary system it produces a formula that is effectively indistinguishable from that of the other methods for the given time range.</p>
","<p>Write the mean anomaly as a Taylor series ($n\equiv 2\pi/P$):
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
M(t) \equiv \int_0^tn\,\mathrm{d}t &amp;=&amp; M_0 + \dot{M}_0t + \frac{1}{2}\ddot{M}_0t^2 + \mathcal{O}(t^3)\\
&amp;=&amp;n_0t + \frac{1}{2}\dot{n}_0t^2 + \mathcal{O}(t^3)\\
&amp;=&amp;\frac{2\pi}{P_0}t - \pi\frac{\dot{P}_0}{P_0^2}t^2+\mathcal{O}(t^3)\text{.}
\end{eqnarray*}$$</p>

<p>The periastron time (epoch) happens when $M(t) = 2\pi N$, where $N$ counts number of orbits, while $NP_0$ <em>would</em> be the periastron time if the orbital period stayed constant. Therefore, treating $N$ as continuous, the cumulative difference is just
$$t - \frac{M(t)}{2\pi}P_0 \approx \frac{1}{2}\frac{\dot{P}_0}{P_0}t^2\text{.}$$
If we want more accuracy, we can calculate the next term in the Taylor series,
$$\frac{1}{6}\ddot{n}_0t^3 = \frac{\pi}{3P_0^2}\left[\frac{2\dot{P}_0^2}{P_0}-\ddot{P}_0\right]t^3\text{,}$$
and if $\dot{P} = KP^{-5/3}$ for $\dot{K}\approx 0$, we can eliminate the $\ddot{P}_0$ term to give a cumulative shift of
$$t - \frac{M(t)}{2\pi}P_0 \approx \frac{1}{2}\frac{\dot{P}_0}{P_0}t^2 - \frac{11}{18}\left(\frac{\dot{P}_0}{P_0}\right)^2t^3\text{.}$$
According to the Weisberg &amp; Taylor paper, $|\dot{P}_0/P_0| \sim 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, so the cubic term is negligible over the thirty-year time scale, and we can safely ignore anything past the quadratic term.</p>

<p>Just for kicks, we can solve $\dot{P} = KP^{-5/3}$ for constant $K$, which yields a cumulative periastron time shift of
$$\frac{3}{5x}\left[1+\frac{5}{3}xt-\left(1-\frac{8}{3}xt\right)^{5/8}\right]\text{.}$$
$K$ is not actually constant, being a function of the eccentricity $e$, although the rate of change of $e$ is tiny, on the order of $10^{-11}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, and we can ignore it on the scales we're talking about. Additionally, the proportionality formula is based on a orbital average of radiation reaction at 2.5-th post-Newtonian order.</p>

<hr>

<p>The values presented in the paper are for the epoch $T_0 = 52144.90097844$ (MJD):
$$\small{\begin{eqnarray*}
P_0 &amp;=&amp; 0.322997448930\,(4)\,\mathrm{d}\\
%\dot{P}_0 &amp;=&amp; −(2.4184\pm0.0009)\times 10^{-12}\\
%\dot{P}_0^{\scriptsize\text{corr}} &amp;=&amp; -(2.4056\pm 0.0051)\times 10^{-12}\\
\dot{P}_0^{\scriptsize\text{GTR}} &amp;=&amp; −2.40242\,(2)\times 10^{-12}\\
\end{eqnarray*}}$$
Thus, we can calculate the ratio $x_0 = \dot{P}_0/P_0 = -8.60867\,(7)\times 10^{-17}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The difference between $T_0$ and the beginning of 1975 is $\delta t = 9731\,\mathrm{d}$, which is not long enough for this ratio to change appreciably, since relative first-order correction would be around $|\dot{x}_0(\delta t)/x_0| \sim |x_0(\delta t)| \sim 10^{-7}$.</p>

<p>Alternatively, following <strong>zibadawa timmy</strong>, we can also solve $K = \dot{P}P^{5/3}$ explicitly for constant $K$, which is not exactly true but approximates well:
$$\newcommand{\constKeq}{\overset{\scriptsize\dot{K}\approx 0}{=}}\begin{eqnarray*}
P &amp;\constKeq&amp; \left[P_0^{8/3}+\frac{8}{3}\dot{P}_0P_0^{5/3}t\right]^{3/8}\!\!\!\!\!\text{,}\\
x &amp;\constKeq&amp; \frac{\dot{P}}{P} = \frac{x_0}{1+\frac{8}{3}x_0t}\text{,}
\end{eqnarray*}$$
and therefore $\left.x\right|_{1975}$ is indeed indistinguishable from $x_0$ at this level of accuracy.</p>

<p>I've graphed (in light blue) the result from the quadratic shift formula with this $x$  and superimposed the graph from the Weisberg &amp; Taylor paper (cropped on outer borders and then rescaled to be $500\times 500\,\mathrm{px}$):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jteR1.png"" alt=""Hulse–Taylor graph reconstruction""></p>

<p>It's an exact match except for a constant time shift, which is just a matter of when we set the $t = 0$ time. PSR B1913+16 was actually discovered in 1974, and the first data point is at the end of 1974. That is why my graph is shifted slightly by a fraction of a year.</p>

The periastron time is well-defined because it depends on the closest approach, so the magnitude of the positional periastron advance $\langle\dot{\omega}\rangle = 4.226595^\circ/\mathrm{yr}$ is not directly relevant. GTR <em>also</em> predicts $\langle\dot{\omega}\rangle$, but that's not what we're considering here.</p>

<p>The mean anomaly is not actually an angle, despite counting off each periastron as $2\pi$. It isn't an angle even in exact Keplerian elliptic orbits, even though they have the exact same periastron at each period. Thus, $\langle\dot{\omega}\rangle$ is a different issue.</p>

"Two species of dark matter?","1085","","<p>At this point in time, evidence for the existence of dark matter has accumulated in many ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>it affects galactic rotation curves</li>
<li>plays a major role in cosmology, and the evolution of structure in the universe</li>
<li>is predicted in copious amounts by gravitational lensing on a wide range of scales</li>
<li>influences the dynamics of galaxy clusters</li>
</ul>

<p>to name a few.</p>

<p>There are many known candidates for dark matter particles: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles"">WIMPs</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion"">axions</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisp"">WISPs</a>, neutrinos, etc (in fact, even bricks, though some other considerations would exclude them).</p>

<p><strong>The question then is</strong>: 
Why do we expect that only one type of dark matter particles is responsible for phenomenological dark matter? </p>

<p>For example, $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the standard cosmological model, requires dark matter to be cold (slow, non-relativistic), which is used to constrain the possible properties of dark matter particles. However, this doesn't actually imply, that dark matter is cold for all the astrophysical systems. For example, galactic halos could be made of warm dark matter, and halos of dwarf galaxies could be made of cold dark matter.</p>

<p>One might of course say that one-species model is the simplest one. The counter-argument would be that in reality there well may be many species. This in turn might have profound implications for astrophysical models. </p>

<p>To summarize the question: <strong>Is there any good reason, preferably supported by observations, to think that only one species of dark matter is present in all the models currently used?</strong></p>
","<p>Hot dark matter would be made from very light, fast moving particles. Such particles could not possibly be gravitationally bound to any structure, but rather would be dispersed all across the universe.</p>

<p>But dark matter is always ""found"" (or ""inferred"") either gravitationally bound to some visible structure (e.g. weak lensing detection of dark matter associated with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster"">colliding galaxy clusters</a> / flat <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve"">rotation curves of spiral galaxies</a> / abnormal <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virial_theorem#Galaxies_and_cosmology_.28virial_mass_and_radius.29"">velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters</a>) or not associated to anything visible but nevertheless forming clumps (weak lensing detection of <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104094"">galaxy clusters previously unseen</a>). That is why dark matter is thought to be <em>cold</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is a clear distinction between both types: there is not such thing as dark matter that is ""not too cold but not too hot either"" (see footnote as well). Dark matter is <a href=""http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v29/i10/p669_1"">either made of particles with less than ~10 eV</a> (hot dark matter, made of light particles, mostly dispersed everywhere) or <a href=""http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v39/i4/p165_1"">particles with more than ~2 GeV</a> (heavier, slower particles gravitationally bound to some structure). Both limits are found when imposing the maximum amount in which the candidate particles (neutrinos or something more exotic) can possibly contribute to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model"">the actual value of the density parameter</a> due to matter in our expaning Universe.</p>

<p>Thus, either DM appears gravitationally bound (cold DM) or dispersed (hot DM), and both types are clearly distinct (10 ev vs 2 Gev). Observations favour the first case. However, Cold Dark Matter is not the ultimate solution, and still faces some problems.</p>

<p>Regarding the possibility of mixed solutions, many of them have been already ruled out. Microlensing has ruled out the possibility of unseen compact objects (brown dwarfs, stars, stellar black holes) in galactic halos, <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001272"">in our galactic neighbourhood</a> as well as <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3645"">in the extragalactic domain</a>. Ordinary matter (stones, bricks, dust) cannot possibly be, otherwise they would become hot and re-radiate. Any exotic mix of known particles doesn't work.</p>

<p>All we think we know is that DM must be made of some heavy particles yet to be discovered. In order to introduce a more complex model (e.g. different types of particles depending on the structure they appear attached to) one needs a justification (i.e. some predictions that better agree with reality) and nobody has been able to do that yet.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Remark</strong> Note that Dark Matter particles, either from the hot or the cold type, cannot possibly ""slow down"" and clump too much (e.g. forming planets) because they don't interact electromagnetically like ordinary matter, that is why DM is said to be <em><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0002308"">collisionless</a></em>. Wherever infalling ordinary matter forms any structure (e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar"">protostars</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disc"">accretion disks</a>), a very important part of the process is <em>thermalisation</em>, i.e. the redistribution of energy of the infalling particles by means of numerous collisions. This cannot happen with Dark Matter.</p>

<p>These two spots are known as <strong>the east and west bays</strong> of the Crab Nebula. They appear to be the result of a torus partially encircling a section of the nebula.

It has been conjectured that the torus is the result of a $\sim0.1M_{\odot}$ ejection of material from a circumstellar disk prior to the supernova, based on studies of the proper motion of gas on the edges of both bays.</p>

"How much mass will the Sun have when it becomes a white dwarf?","1080","","<p>In 4 billion years, when our Sun sheds all of its outer gas layers and turns into a white dwarf, how much mass will the white dwarf have compared to what the sun has today?</p>

<p>Will the planets still orbit in the same way, or will the reduced mass cause the planets' trajectories to change, so that they eventually leave the solar system?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> </p>

<p>The Sun will lose about half of its mass on the way to becoming a white dwarf. Most of this mass loss will occur in the last few million years of its life, during the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. At the same time the orbital radius of the Earth around the Sun will grow by a factor of two (as will the outer planets). Unfortunately for the Earth, the radius of the Sun will also reach to about 2 au, so it will be toasted.</p>

<p>There is the possibility that the decreased binding energy and increased eccentricity of the Earth and the outer planets will lead to dynamical instabilities that could lead to planetary ejection. This is highly dependent on the exact time dependence of the late, heavy mass loss and the alignment or otherwise of the planets at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p>

<p>Stars with mass less than about 8 solar masses will end their lives as white dwarfs on a timescale which increases as their main sequence initial mass decreases. The white dwarfs that are formed are of lower mass than their progenitor main sequence stars, because much of the initial mass of a star is lost through stellar winds (particularly during the thermally pulsating <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_giant_branch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">asymptotic giant branch</a> phase) and final ejection of a planetary nebula.  Thus, the current distribution of white dwarf masses, that peaks between $0.6$ and $0.7 M_{\odot}$ and with a dispersion of $\sim 0.2 M_{\odot}$, reflects the final states of all main sequence stars with $0.9 &lt;M/M_{\odot}&lt;8 M_{\odot}$, that have had time to evolve and die during our Galaxy's lifetime.</p>

<p>The most reliable information we have about the relationship between the initial main sequence mass and final white dwarf mass (the initial-final mass relation or IFMR) comes from measuring the properties of white dwarfs in star clusters of known age. Spectroscopy leads to a mass estimate for the white dwarf. The initial mass is estimated by calculating a main sequence plus giant branch lifetime from the difference between the age of the star cluster and the cooling age of the white dwarf. Stellar models then tell us the relationship between main sequence plus giant lifetime and the initial main sequence mass, hence leading to an IFMR.</p>

<p>A recent compilation from <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MmSAI..84...58K"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kalirai (2013)</a> is shown below. This shows that a star like the Sun, born with an initial mass of $1M_{\odot}$ (or maybe a per cent or two more), ends its life as a white dwarf with $M = 0.53 \pm 0.03\ 
M_{\odot}$. i.e. The Sun should lose approximately 50% of its initial mass in stellar winds and (possibly) planetary nebula ejection.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IS3SM.png"" alt=""IFMR from Kalirai (2013)""></p>

<p>A comprehensive treatment of what happens to solar systems when the central star loses mass in a time-dependent way is given in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3841"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Adams et al. (2013)</a>. The simplest cases are initially circular orbits where the mass loss takes place on much longer timescales than the orbital period. As mass loss proceeds, the gravitational potential energy increases (becomes less negative) and thus the total orbital energy increases and the orbit gets wider. Roughly speaking, $aM$ is a constant, where $a$ is the orbital radius: so the Sun would end up in a 2 au orbit.</p>

<p>However, in the presence of a non-zero eccentricity in the initial orbit, or in the case of rapid mass loss, such as that which occurs towards the end of the AGB phase, then things become altogether more unpredictable, with the eccentricity also growing as mass loss proceeds. This has a knock-on effect when considering the dynamical stability of the whole (evolved) solar system and may result in planetary ejection. The faster the mass loss, the more unpredictable things get.</p>

<p>The radius of an AGB star can be calculated using $ L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{eff}^{4}$. Stars at the tip of the AGB branch have luminosities of $\sim 10^{4} L_{\odot}$ and $T_{eff} \simeq 2500\ K$, leading to likely radii of $\sim 2$ au. So it is quite likely that unless the Earth is ejected or has its orbit significantly modified by some dynamical instability that, like the inner planets, it will end up engulfed in the outer enevelope of the AGB star and spiral inwards...</p>

"Is it possible to be 'still' in space?","1078","","<p>So I was reading <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/895/1016"">this</a> answer about how galaxies are the fastest moving objects in the universe because space is expanding faster than the speed of light. This got me wondering, would it be possible to be 'still' inside of space so that galaxies are moving away from you and others towards you? If so, wouldn't this allow us to travel from place to place in the universe much quicker? I know that this wouldn't be something that's even close to possible today, but I was just curious if such a thing is possible. Thank you.</p>
","<p>The so called expansion of the universe is not as trivial as most people think. What is happening, in fact, is that the distance between two points in space (note that I'm not talking about objects with velocities, but just coordinates in space) increases with time in a manner proportional to a given factor (in this case, the Hubble constant - which is actually not a constant in time, but let's ignore that for now).</p>

<p>This means that galaxies are not exactly moving away from a specific point with a particular velocity (i.e., a particular rest frame), but that the space between them is expanding. It is somewhat hard to wrap your head around the difference between these two situations, but this has to do with the geometry of space, and not with what's inside it.</p>

<p>It is widely accepted that the expansion of the universe is <a href=""http://physics.ucr.edu/~wudka/Physics7/Notes_www/node124.html"">homogeneous and isotropic</a> (the Cosmological Principle), which means that there is no ""special"" position (rest frame) on the universe, and whatever your velocity and your location, the universe will seem to expand the same way.</p>

<p>The best way to imagine this is to reduce to 2 dimensions expanding in a third dimension. For example, suppose that you live in a galaxy embedded on the surface (a 2D universe) of a balloon (completely unaware of the third dimension), with other galaxies distributed homogeneously. If, for some reason, the balloon is expanding isotropically and, every point of the surface will be moving away from every other point, so will every galaxy from each other. Think about this: is it possible to find a special, ""still"", point (without resorting to the elusive third dimension) where you will see galaxies moving from you in one side and galaxies moving towards you on the other side?</p>

<p>Our universe works similarly, but we're embedded on a three-dimensional space instead of a two-dimensional one.</p>

How does the Sun burn without oxygen?</p>

<p>It might not be burning but a big part of the society speaks of it as burning.</p>

<p>So how does it work?</p>
","<p>As you are suspecting, the sun burns in a different sense, not by chemical reaction with oxygen.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"">Atoms</a> consist of a tiny, heavy <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus"">nucleus</a>, surrounded by an almost empty space, populated by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons"">electrons</a>. Burning by chemical reaction with oxygen doesn't change the nucleus of atoms, but takes place in the hull of atoms: Atoms may assemble to form <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"">molecules</a>; electrons change their <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital"">orbitals</a> (the way they surround the nucleus), and release some energy as heat.</p>

<p>Atomic nuclei are (positively) electrically charged, and repell each other.
But if small nuclei, like those of hydrogen atoms, come close together, they can <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"">fuse</a> and form a larger nucleus. This nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium (in this case) releases much energy, more even than <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission"">fission</a> of uranium in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant"">nuclear power plant</a>. The notion ""burning"" is used sometimes for reactions of atomic nuclei, too, if they release energy as heat.</p>

<p>To overcome the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law"">electrostatic repulsion</a> of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom"">hydrogen</a> nuclei, high pressure and temperature are needed. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-proton_chain"">These conditions</a> occur in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core"">core of the Sun</a>.</p>

 From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hill_sphere_of_the_planets.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hill_sphere_of_the_planets.png</a> </p>

<p>I found it interesting that variation of Hill sphere is intuitive for the first five planets, as the variation is similar to variation of mass/radius of those planets. Mercury has the smallest Hill sphere, Venus/Earth/Mars quite similar, and a giant leap from Mars to Jupiter.</p>

<p>But, Saturn has its Hill sphere bigger than Jupiter, even it is smaller than Jupiter. and this anomaly continues to Uranus and Neptune: They have progressively larger Hill spheres.</p>

<p>And Hill spheres of Pluto and Eris are quite larger than Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.</p>

<p>This was quite surprising for me. Could someone explain why this—for the lack of a better word—<em>anomalies</em> are there?</p>
","<p>Hill sphere is the region of space around a satellite where the satellite wins the gravitational tug-of-war with its primary.</p>

<p>If the mass of the primary object is $M$, mass of the satellite is $m$, semi-major axis of satellite is $a$, and eccentricity of the orbit of the satellite is $e$, then the radius $r$ of the Hill sphere for satellite is given by:</p>

<p>$$
r \approx a (1-e) \sqrt[3]{\frac{m}{3 M}}
$$</p>

<p>Note that this formula does <em>not</em> take into account the other objects in the  vicinity.</p>

<p>The anomaly pointed out in the question is not <em>really</em> an anomaly. The contributing factor for the surprise values is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_axis"" rel=""nofollow"">semi-major axis</a> of the planets ($a$).</p>

<p>Take Jupiter and Saturn for example: Saturn has only around $30\%$ of the mass of Jupiter, and if the two gas giants had the same semi-major axis, this mass reduction will make Saturn's Hill sphere around $68\%$ than that of Jupiter. But Saturn is around $84\%$ farther from Sun than Jupiter. This is just enough to make Saturn's Hill sphere slightly larger than that of Jupiter.</p>

<p>Thinking along the same lines, we can also explain why Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Eris have surprisingly large Hill spheres.</p>

<p>This confuses me. Why not let the x-axis go from lower values to higher values? This will also help visualising the “linear” relation between the luminosity and the temperature of a star in the main sequence.</p>

<p>Okay, back to the topic at hand. Wikipedia, of course, has a short tidbit on the frequency of gamma-ray bursts effecting Earth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Estimating the exact rate at which GRBs occur is difficult, but for a galaxy of approximately the same size as the Milky Way, the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) is about one burst every 100,000 to 1,000,000 years. Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.</p>

<p>'A small percentage' isn't too specific. <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-21082617"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The BBC article</a> that is cited in this passage says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Observations of deep space suggest that gamma ray-bursts are rare. They are thought to happen at the most every 10,000 years per galaxy, and at the least every million years per galaxy.</p>

"Maximum and minimum gas giant & ice giant densities","1030","","<p>I'm working on a star system generator for a game; I'd like its results to be plausible but they needn't be super-realistic. I've got the orbital distances and masses of each body in the system, and now want to render them, so I need to determine the radius of each body.</p>

<p>For gas giant and ice giant planets, what's the relationship between mass and density? What are the minimum and maximum densities expected? </p>
","<p>Here is a plot I generated in 5 minutes at the site <a href=""http://exoplanets.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exoplanets.org</a></p>

<p>To construct this I took planets discovered by the <em>transit</em> method <em>and</em> which had a $M \sin i$ measured using radial velocities. I divided the $M \sin i$ by the sine of the measured inclination angle (this is required to avoid using masses that have been estimated using an assumed mass-radius relation). The y-axis is density, which comes directly (and quite precisely) from transit measurements. Of course transiting planets are the only ones with radii and density measurements.</p>

<p>You have to do this to avoid some very uncertain values that are given for planetary masses that have been simply assumed from a theoretical mass-radius relationship.</p>

<p>As you can see, there is a wide spread (factor of three) in density at a given mass for hot Jupiter's (most of the <em>transiting</em> giant planets are hot Jupiters), but there is a strong correlation. The density is at a minimum for a few tenths of Jupiter mass, but then smaller planets (presumably rocky and icy, rather than gas giants) appear to show higher densities.</p>

<p>Remember, these are all transiting exoplanets, and therefore predominantly orbiting close to their parent stars. There could be biases and selection effects at work! For example although the cores of gas giants are governed by degeneracy pressure and this makes the <em>theoretical</em> mass-radius relationship quite flat, there is the perturbing effect of radiation from the parent star (""insolation"") that can make some objects larger. Even beyond this there appears to be scatter that is difficult to understand.</p>

"What happens when star spins too fast?","1029","","<p>Some stars such as a neutron star can spin very fast around 600 times a second, wouldn't the star be ripped apart? Although the gravitational pull is very strong but gravity is the weakest of all known forces and any good theory why neutron stars spin that fast does it have anything to do with the magnetic field and the surrounding dust clouds?</p>
","<p>The structure (mass versus radius and density profile) <em>is</em> influenced by its rotation rate, but not by as much as you might think.</p>

<p>Even in Newtonian physics you can think of a mass element $m$ at the surface of a star of mass $M$ and radius $R$, rotating with angular velocity $\omega$.</p>

<p>A condition for stability would be that the surface gravity is strong enough to provide the centripetal acceleration of the test mass.
$$ \frac{GMm}{R^2} &gt; m R \omega^2$$
If this is not satisfied then the object might break up (it is more complicated than this because the object will not stay spherical and the radius at the equator will increase etc., but these are small numerical factors).</p>

<p>Thus
$$ \omega &lt; \left(\frac{GM}{R^3}\right)^{1/2}$$
or in terms of rotation period $P = 2\pi/\omega$ and so
$$ P &gt; 2\pi \left(\frac{GM}{R^3}\right)^{-1/2},$$
is the condition for stability.</p>

<p>For a typical $1.4M_{\odot}$ neutron star with radius 10 km, then $P&gt;0.46$ milli-seconds. A proper General Relativistic calculation of this limit would give a similar result, but depends to some extent on the equation of state of the neutron star.</p>

<p>Happily, this is easily satisfied for all observed neutron stars - they can spin extremely fast because of their <em>enormous</em> surface gravities and all are well below the instability limit. I believe the fastest known rotating pulsar has a period of 1.4 milli-seconds.</p>

<p>You also ask how pusars can attain these speeds. There are two classes of explanation for the two classes of pulsars.</p>

<p>Most pulsars are thought (at least initially) to be the product of a core-collapse supernova. The core collapses from something a little smaller than the radius of the Earth, to about 10km radius in a fraction of a second. Conservation of angular momentum demands that the rotation rate increases as the inverse of the radius <em>squared</em>. i.e. The spin rate increases by factors of a million or so.</p>

<p>Pulsars spin down with age because they turn their rotational kinetic energy into magnetic dipole radiation. However, the fastest rotating pulsars - the ""milli-second pulsars"" are ""born again"", by accreting material from a binary companion. The accreted material has angular momentum and the accretion of this angular momentum is able to spin the neutron star up to very high rates because it has a relatively (for a stellar-mass object) small moment of inertia.</p>

"Is there any practical use for astronomy?","1025","","<p>Although astronomy is very cool and the things we are learning are awesome, is there really any practical use to knowing the things we know about the universe?  </p>

<p>Do other fields of science draw from the current tome of astronomical knowledge?</p>
","<p>This question begs the question, does everything need a practical use? The answer is a resounding no. What's the practical use of the Louvre, or of your local neighborhood public park where you enjoy weekend barbecues?</p>

<p>There are some things that are very worthwhile that have little or no economical gain. Your local neighborhood public park in fact has negative economic gain. Admission is free, but maintenance is not. Think of how much money your city would make if they sold it to a condominium developer, and how much money it would save by not having to pay to have the park maintained.</p>

<p>Despite having no obvious economic gain, some things are nonetheless worth quite a bit. Many of the sciences fall in this category. For example, what is the practical use of archeology? (There are some, but that's not the point.)</p>

<p>Astronomy, like archeology, the Louvre, and your local public park, doesn't need a practical economical purpose. The purpose of the science is good enough.</p>

<p>That said, there are practical applications of astronomy. The key application has been and still is navigation. Knowing the location of a ship at sea or the orientation of a vehicle in space requires astronomy.</p>

<p>A less direct but still very important application of astronomy is in how it informs physics. Kepler was an astronomer, not a physicist. (Those two disciplines were very, very distinct in Kepler's day). Yet Kepler's work informed Newton on how to describe gravitation. More recently, astronomy has informed physics that its standard model was not quite correct. The observed neutrino flux from the Sun (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino_problem"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino_problem</a>) was a third of what physics at the time said it should be. This resulted in a change to the standard model. Neutrinos have a small but non-zero mass, and they oscillate from one form to another.</p>

<p>Astronomy continues to inform physics to this day. Physicists (and astronomers) remain clueless with regard to what constitutes dark matter and dark energy. But whatever they are, they certainly do exist.</p>

<p>For example, it's been a whole century since they had accurate enough measurements to tell that Mercury was precessing in a way that didn't jive with Newtonian mechanics.<br>
Now, if there are Earth-sized planets out there, shouldn't their presence have a pretty sizable effect on the orbits of bodies such as Neptune and Pluto? How can there be such large planets with no measurable effects until 2017 technology came along?</p>
","<p>There could be another planet in the solar system that has not been discovered if that planet had a highly elliptical orbit with a single orbit taking many hundreds of earth years to complete. That planet could be in the part of its orbit further from sun and could stay in that area for a few hundred years, longer than we've had large telescopes.</p>

<p>At such a distance it would receive very little sunlight and the chances of visually detecting it would be very small. And we wouldn't know where to look either, which just compounds the problem.</p>

<p>Other more distant plants have been discovered but their discovery was due to the effects on the star or stars it is orbiting. We observe a planet passing in front of a star which briefly lowers the apparent magnitude of its parent star. This is a good clue of a planet in orbit. This is impossible in our solar system because an unknown planet would have to come between us and the sun. We would easily see it if that were the case.</p>

<p>We have observed some discrepancies in the orbits of some of the outer planets. This has led to the speculation of another planet. It is very difficult to determine the cause of these small discrepancies though. All bodies orbiting our sun are not only effected by the suns gravity but by the gravitational attraction of all other bodies (including all objects in the asteroid and Kuiper belts). This is a very intense calculation. This attraction constantly changes due to the motion of all the bodies.</p>

"How many galaxies disappear beyond the Hubble Bubble horizon every year now?","1018","","<p>The accelerating expansion of space means that the space between us and far away galaxies expands faster than light can travel through space. There is a horizon of possible observation beyond which galaxies disappear from us.</p>

<p>At what rate do galaxies, or some other measurement of mass/energy, disappear beyond that horizon at present rate? Will future telescopes actually see galaxies red shift themselves into oblivion? I imagine there being issues about the definitions of ""when"" and ""where"" in this context. Answers should try to address how they deal with that.</p>

<p>Since the radius of the observable universe expands at the speed of light, my intuition tells me that there should've been a point in time when the expansion of space balanced the arrival of light of more distant parts of space. if so, when did that happen?</p>
","<p>This is a tricky question to answer, because it has some false and imprecise assumptions baked into it. The short version is: I don't know at what rate stuff is currently crossing the cosmic Event Horizon. But future telescopes will not see these galaxies redshift themselves into oblivion, because this will happen in the infinitely far future, literally. Cosmological redshift is equivalent to relativistic time dilation; events that are redshifted from our point of view also play out slower, and infinite redshift means they come to a complete halt.</p>

<p>It is also not correct that the radius of the observable Universe is expanding at the speed of light. There are two different radii that could be candidates for the title ""limit of the observable Universe""; they are very different but both expand <em>faster</em> than light.</p>

<p>Your intuition is right, however, that the distance at which galaxies recede from us at exactly light speed - the one we call the <strong>Hubble Sphere</strong> - has been expanding and since approaching us again. It reached its maximum when the cosmic expansion went from decelerating to accelerating, when the Universe was around half its current age. The Hubble Sphere, however, is not the limit of anything. </p>

<p>One of the two horizons, the one that seems to be the one you have in mind in the beeginning of your question, is the <strong>Event Horizon</strong>. This is the current distance, beyond which light emitted at this cosmological time will never have the chance to reach us. This horizon receding from us in proper distance, and since it is located outside the Hubble Sphere, these regions of Space are actually receding from us faster than light.
In <strong>co-moving coordinates</strong>, the event horizon is <em>approaching</em> us. Co-moving coordinates is a coordinate system that stretches along with the expansion of the Universe, such that a galaxy that is not influenced by anything else than cosmic expansion will have constant coordinates in time. Because the cosmological expansion is accelerating, it gets harder and harder for light at a fixed co-moving distance to reach us until it gets impossible and the Galaxy redshifts to infinity. This  is equivalent to saying that the Event Horizon has moved inwards past this galaxy in co-moving coordinates. In proper coordinates, it amounts to saying that the galaxy overtakes the Event Horizon.
Ours, by the way, is currently at a redshift of around 2, around 18 billion light years away. The light we receive from this distance is only slightly redshifted now, but the light that is emitted now will be redshifted to  infinity when it reaches us at infinite time.</p>

<p>There is also another horizon, however, which does expand forever, also in co-moving coordinates. That is the current co-moving distance at which light emitted at the time of Big Bang reaches us just now. In co-moving coordinates, this horizon expands slower and slower, which is why the CMB gets more and more redshifted. Objects currently on the Particle Horizon are a long time out of our Event Horizon - we can only ever see the very beginning of their history, before they redshift into oblivion. And the objects shifting into our particle horizon will show us still less of their history before having left the Event Horizon for good (yes, language gets hairy when talking relativistic time).</p>

<p>So it is hard say what the limit of the observable Universe is, it is simply not well defined. The Event Horizon has always been growing in proper distance but shrinking in co-moving distance. The Particle Horizon has always been growing both in co+moving and proper distance. The Event Horizon has always been expanding faster than light, and always will. The particle horizon started out slower,  but very soon overtook lightspeed in expansion velocity. </p>

<p>Interestingly, all objects with a redshift higher than $z \sim 1.5$ are not just receding faster than light, but they always have been! Yet we observe them with no trouble.</p>

Due to it's gravitational mass it can deflect meteorites and protect Earth from the Oort cloud.  While these are positives, the negative effects are that Jupiter can draw comets in from the Kuiper belt which may have catastrophic consequences.  </p>

<p>Do other planets have a similar effect on the solar system?</p>
","<p>The gravitational pull of all the planets and the sun, and the rest of the galaxy and the universe, all play a part, but gravitational effects fall off with distance.</p>

<p>For Earth's orbit, the Sun is far and away the single biggest influence. Jupiter perturbs our orbit slightly, but with it or without it we have a simple elliptical orbit round the sun. We can measure the perturbation in our orbit from all the planets, but the effects are minor.</p>

<p>When it comes to gravitational effects on small bodies passing one of the planets, however, the effects can be dramatic - an asteroid passing close to Jupiter will be moved far from its original path. The same would be true when passing close to Saturn or in fact any planet - just to a lesser degree.</p>

<p>So while you can't say that Jupiter protects Earth from anything, especially not the Oort Cloud, you also can't say that it draws objects in. Anything out in the Kuiper belt or Oort cloud will be orbiting the barycentre of the solar system (which is within the Sun) and will keep doing that unless knocked out by something  like a collision with another object, or the pull of other Kuiper belt objects like Pluto, which can give a much greater tug.</p>

"What is the Fundamental plane for Elliptical Galaxies?","1014","","<p>An alternate explanation rather than from wikipedia is preferable.</p>
","<p>I am not an expert, but it seems that the fundamental plane is a relation among characteristic quantities of the galaxy, showing a correlation that is the analogous of the Tully-Fisher relation for spiral galaxies.</p>

<p>You can start from the virial theorem: 
$\frac{M}{R}\sim v^2$</p>

<p>($M$ mass contained in the radius $R$, $v$ velocity dispersion of the stars, also indicated with $\sigma$ in these cases)
meaning that the stars behave like an isothermal sphere.</p>

<p>Assuming that all galaxies have the same mass-to-light ratio
$L/M$, and that all galaxies have the same surface brightness</p>

<p>$\Sigma=L/R^2$</p>

<p>(with $L$ luminosity), you obtain the Tully-Fisher relation:</p>

<p>$L\sim v^4$</p>

<p>Of course, all galaxies do not have the same surface brightness.
So if you take $\Sigma=L/R^2$ and substitute that into the virial theorem (keeping the mass-to-light ratio assumption), then a relation between luminosity, surface brightness, and velocity dispersion is obtained:</p>

<p>$L \sim \sigma^4 \Sigma^{-1}$</p>

<p>You can plot the stars distributions in elliptical galaxy according to this relation, and will note that the stars do not distribute randomly, but are more concentrated along the fundamental plane (more or less the same happens for the HR diagram):</p>

","<p>This answer is to some degree opinion-based. I share your scepticism about the existence of strict mathematical singularities as General Relativity would predict.

<p>A massless particle travelling with the speed of light results in an undefined energy according to Special Relativity. Nature opens a physics dedicated to massless particles by allowing them to take any energy to resolve this undefined range. In a similar way nature may open a new kind of physics inside black holes to resolve the paradox between General Relativity and quantum theory.</p>

Theoretically, what size of the primary mirror (single/multiple/segmented) can have a telescope on Earth for observing at optical wavelengths? And why? I mean what are physical limitations exists?</p>

<p>And the same question about space (not on Earth)?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>On the advice of @TildalWave, to make this question answerable let's make a few adjustments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Primary mirror should be segmented (or it variations) like on E-ELT.</li>
<li>Suppose we have a large (several square kilometers), flat surface high above sea level.</li>
<li>We have to build telescope for observing at optical wavelengths.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know that, there is concept of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwhelmingly_Large_Telescope"">OWL</a> with 100 metre-diameter segmented primary mirror.</p>

<p>But what about 500 metre-diameter or 1000? Is it possible in theory?</p>
","<p>It's complicated.</p>

<p>Until late-20th century, we've tried to make bigger and bigger monolithic telescopes. That worked pretty well up to the 5 meter parabolic mirror on Mount Palomar in California in the 1940s. It kind of worked, but just barely, for the 6 meter mirror on Caucasus in Russia in the 1970s. It did work, but that was a major achievement, for the twin 8.4 meter mirrors for the LBT in Arizona in the 2000s.</p>

<p>We've learned eventually that the way to go is not by pouring larger and larger slabs of low-expansion glass. It is generally accepted that somewhere just below 10 meters diameter is about as large as possible for monolithic mirrors.</p>

<p>The way to go is by choosing to make smaller mirror segments (1 meter to a few meters in diameter each) and combining those into a tiled mirror. It's somewhat harder to carve the asymmetrical parabolic (or hyperbolic, or elliptic, or spherical) reflecting curved surface in a segment like that, but it's far easier to manage thermal and cooling issues when you have to deal with smaller solid objects.</p>

<p>Each segment is mounted in an active mirror cell, with piezo actuators that very precisely control its position. All segments must combine into a single smooth surface with a precision better than 100 microns (much better than that in reality). So now you have a large array of massive objects, dynamically controlled via computer, each with its own vibration modes, each with its own source of mechanical noise, each with its own thermal expansion motions, all of them ""dancing"" up and down a few microns on piezo elements.</p>

<p>Is it possible to orchestrate a very large system like that? Yes. The 100 meter OWL was considered feasible technically. From the perspective of keeping the mirrors aligned, an even larger structure should be doable; the computer-controlled actuators should overcome most vibrations and shifts up to quite large distances.</p>

<p>Like you said, the real limits are financial. The complexity of such a system increases with the square of the diameter, and with complexity comes cost.</p>

<hr>

<p>The entire discussion above was about ""filled aperture"" telescopes: given a round shape of a certain diameter, it is filled with mirror segments. For a given aperture, this design captures the largest amount of light.</p>

<p>But the aperture does not have to be filled. It can be mostly empty. You could have a few reflecting segments on the periphery, and the center would be mostly void. You'd have the same resolving power (you would see the same small details), it's just that the brightness of the image would decrease, because you're capturing less light total.</p>

<p>This is the principle of the interferometer. The twin 10 meter segmented Keck mirrors in Hawaii can work as an interferometer with a baseline of 85 meters. This is effectively equivalent to a single 85 meter aperture in terms of resolving power, but obviously not in terms of image brightness (amount of light captured).</p>

<p>The US Navy has an interferometer in Arizona with mirrors placed on 3 arms in a Y shape, each arm 250 meters long. That gives the instrument a baseline (equivalent aperture) of several hundreds of meters.</p>

<p>U of Sydney has a 640 meter baseline interferometer in the Australian desert.</p>

<p>Interferometers cannot be used to study very faint objects, because they can't capture enough light. But they can produce very high resolution data from bright objects - e.g. they are used to measure the diameter of stars, such as Betelgeuse.</p>

<p>The baseline of an interferometer can be made extremely large. For terrestrial instruments, a kilometers-wide baseline is very doable now. Larger will be doable in the future.</p>

<p>There are talks about building interferometers in outer space, in orbit around Earth or even bigger. That would provide a baseline at least in the thousands of kilometers. That's not doable now, but seems feasible in the future.</p>

"Why can we still see 10 billion year old galaxies?","997","","<p>I've never fully understood why we can still see galaxies that are 10 billion light years away. The age of the universe is calculated to be 13.9 billion years old and we live on a planet that it is roughly 4 billion years old.

<p>A simple intuitive way to understand that part of your question:
Bigbang happened everywhere, in all of space. As time passes we see more distant parts of the bigbang, or rather, of the microwave background which is the furthest away phenomena we can see. The bigbang as it happened for example 1 billion years ago has passed by us long ago. Today we see the bigbang as it happened 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

"Black hole without singularity?","991","","<p>My question is about the equivalence about having an event horizon and having a singularity.</p>

<p>In one side the implication looks pretty obvious: </p>

<ul>
<li>A singularity implies having an event horizon and therefore a black hole. Since the mass is compressed in a zero volume space, if you get close enough there will be a point where the escape velocity gets bigger than the speed of light so you will get a black hole by definition.</li>
</ul>

<p>But what about the opposite? Does having an event horizon imply the existence of a singularity?</p>

<p>Could it be that you have a neutron star massive enough to reach a escape velocity equal to the speed of light but not strong enough to make the matter collapse?</p>

<p>Even if such star can not exist because the strong force collapses before reaching an event horizon, this doesn't mean an equivalence. </p>

<p>It just means that for some specific value of the maximum strong force this is not possible, but image now an imaginary exotic matter that has a way bigger strong force.</p>

<p>For such ""science fiction"" matter, it would be possible to reach an event horizon without collapsing to a singularity, right?</p>

<p>Or is it really an equivalence between this two concepts, such that no matter how resistant matter is to collapse it will never reach an event horizon?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Does having an event horizon imply the existence of a singularity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An event horizon is not an inherent component of any given object. It's not like once a star turns into a black hole, it suddenly gets an event horizon. The event horizon is merely a mathematical boundary which defines the distance from a mass $M$ where the escape velocity equals the speed of light. I can calculate such a boundary for a black hole, for the Sun, the Earth, or even you. So I guess the answer here is <strong>no, having an event horizon does not imply the existence of a singularity</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could it be that you have a neutron star massive enough to reach a escape velocity equal to the speed of light but not strong enough to make the matter collapse?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer here, technically, is no. The reason being that once it requires a speed greater than or equal to the speed of light to escape your object, it is necessarily a black hole. That is the definition of a black hole. So that means this neutron star you propose is actually a black hole. Another equivalent definition of a black hole is any object whose mass is concentrated inside that object's event horizon.</p>

<p>But you might still ask, could you have a black hole where the mass inside the event horizon is not a singularity. This would require some sort of support to prevent the matter from collapsing down to the singularity. The answer to this is that it is currently unknown. The problem is that inside event horizons, suddenly you need to work with both GR and quantum field theory but those two theories don't play nice. Instead you should be using a Quantum Gravity theory but this theory hasn't been developed. So ultimately any answer to this would be a guess until this theory gets fully fleshed out.</p>

"If an object with mass were to somehow go the speed of light, would it destroy the whole universe?","985","","<p>Would an object with mass traveling the speed of light destroy the whole universe because it would have infinite energy / mass?

However, for the sake of the question, let's assume it were somehow achieved: (e.g. potentially as described here: <a href=""http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-03/pro-tip-flying-faster-speed-light-could-have-devastating-consequences"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-03/pro-tip-flying-faster-speed-light-could-have-devastating-consequences</a>).

Infinite mass should have infinite gravity, which may well destroy the entire universe (although, would this destruction travel at the speed of light, so it would ""slowly"" destroy the universe vs. instantly?).

<p>If we understand the question as a limiting process, which is the only way it makes any sense, the answer is no. For illustrative simplicity, take a spherically symmetric isolated body, so that its exterior gravitational field is the Schwarzschild spacetime. Now boost this to ultrarelativistic speeds. In the speed of light limit, the result is a linearly polarized axisymmetric gravitational pp-wave, the <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aichelburg%E2%80%93Sexl_ultraboost"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aichelburg-Sexl ultraboost</a></em>.</p>

<p>Its effect on test particles it passes is an <em>impulse</em>: it instantaneously bends the worldlines, but does not destroy anything. You can think of this as infinite force acting for an infinitesimally small time, making the overall effect finite and nondestructive, somewhat analogously a particle encountering a Dirac-delta potential in Newtonian physics.</p>

<p>This is similar to ultrarelativistic limit of a moving electric charge. The electric field lines are Lorentz-contracted along the direction of travel, squeezing them together (image credit: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_electromagnetism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a>):</p>

<p>In the ultrarelativistic limit, the electric field in the transeverse direction becomes infinitely strong, but it is also Lorentz-contracted to be infinitely thin. Without ignoring the magnetic field, the result is an electromagnetic plane wave with a Dirac delta profile. The gravitational case is analogous, though quantitatively different.

<p>No, that's completely wrong. It doesn't become a black hole for the same reason it doesn't destroy the universe: the gravitating body moving relativistically past a stationary observer is physically equivalent to a relativistic observer moving past a stationary gravitating body. But the observer moving relativistically obviously does not nothing to the gravitating body!</p>

"Maximum spin rate of a black hole?","984","","<p>I have just been watching a podcast called ""Deep Astronomy"" and the discussion was about a super fast spinning black hole discovered with the NuSTAR space observatory. This black hole was modeled with high confidence to be spinning at about 99% of the maximum spin rate. They stopped short of saying that the tangential velocity of this spin rate is ""c"" (and how can a singularity have a ""tangential velocity""?) They did say that the event horizon at maximum spin of a stellar black hole is about 1-1/2 km. and that if a black hole were to spin faster then the result would be a ""naked black hole"" that would defy the laws of physics (GR). </p>

<p>Also, shouldn't all black holes spin extremely fast (conservation of angular momentum) or would a retrograde accretion disk slow it down. Could somebody clarify this whole ""black hole spin thing"" without getting too complicated??</p>
","<p>Since I like math, let's throw some math into this. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible though.</p>

<h3>Kerr Black Holes</h3>

<p>A rotating black hole is known as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kerr Black Hole</a> (named after <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Kerr"" rel=""noreferrer"">Roy Kerr</a> who found the numerical solution to GR equations for rotating black holes). In the case of a rotating black hole, there are two important parameters used to describe the black hole. The first is of course the mass of the black hole $M$. The second is the spin $a$. Really $a$ isn't the spin itself $-$ it's defined by $a=J/M$ <sub>(see footnote)</sub> where $J$ is the angular momentum of the black hole $-$ but it's a good proxy for spin so often you'll see scientists get lazy and just call it the spin of the black hole. The mathematics will tell you that Kerr black holes have the limitation that </p>

<p>$$0 \le a/M \le 1$$</p>

<p><strong>Black Hole Event Horizon</strong></p>

<p>The important parameter we want to calculate is the black hole's radius. If you run through the math, you find that this radius is given by</p>

<p>$$r_e = M+(M^2-a^2)^{1/2}$$</p>

<p>In the case when $a/M=0$ (and thus $a=0$), this reduces to just $r_e=2M$, or in regular units (instead of geometrized units) $r_e=2GM/c^2$. Hopefully you can see that this just reduces to the normal <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius"" rel=""noreferrer"">Schwarzchild radius</a> for a non-rotating black hole and thus the equation above is a generalization to account for spin. Let's look at the other limit when $a/M=1$ (and thus $a=M$). In this case, you find that the radius is $r_e=M$. When $a/M=1$, you have a <em>maximally rotating</em> black hole, and your radius is half the normal Schwarzchild radius of a non-rotating black hole. This equation defines the radius of the Event Horizon, the point after which there is no returning from the black hole.</p>

<p><strong>Ergosphere</strong></p>

<p>As it turns out, when you define your equation to calculate the radius of the black hole, there are actually multiple solutions! The section above shows one such solution, but there's another important solution as well. This radius, sometimes called the <em>static limit</em> is given by the equation</p>

<p>$$r_{s} = M+\left(M-a^2\cos^2(\theta)\right)^{1/2}$$</p>

<p>Notice that this is almost exactly the same as above, except for that extra $\cos^2(\theta)$. This defines a different, slightly larger and somewhat ""pumpkin-shaped"" horizon which encompasses the inner Event Horizon defined above. The region between this outer horizon and the inner horizon is known as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergosphere"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ergosphere</a>. Without getting into the nitty gritty details, I'll just say that one important point about the Ergosphere is that anything inside it (that is, $r_e&lt;r&lt;r_s$) must rotate exactly with the black hole - it is physically impossible to stay still here!</p>

<h3>Answers</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>They stopped short of saying that the tangential velocity of this spin rate is ""c"" (and how can a singularity have a ""tangential velocity""?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you talk about the tangential velocity, there are multiple components of this black hole you/they may be talking about. One such tangential velocity is the tangential velocity of the event horizon (defined by $r_e$ above). We can take a look at the case of a maximally rotating black hole and say that the angular momentum, based on the equations above, of such a black hole is given by</p>

<p>$$J_{max} = a_{max}Mc = M^2c$$</p>

<p>Note that I've dropped the geometrized units just to be completely explicit. This has introduced an extra $c$ now. Remember that $a_{max}$ is achieved when $a/M=1$.</p>

<p>We can also define the angular momentum using the standard equation from physics 101, $J=rMv_\perp$, where of course $r$ is the radius of your object, and $v_\perp$ is the perpendicular, or else tangential, velocity of your spinning object. Recall from above that for a maximally rotating black hole, $r_e=M$ so we also have that</p>

<p>$$J_{max} = r_eMv_{\perp} = M^2v_\perp$$</p>

<p>You can see that these two equations for $J_{max}$ only equal each other if the tangential velocity $v_\perp$ is equal to the speed of light $c$. So yes, you are correct to presume that at the fastest possible rotations, the black hole's event horizon is rotating at the speed of light!</p>

<p>I said though that there are multiple components you could talk about when discussing rotating black holes. The other, as you allude to, is the rotating singularity. You correctly point out - ""how can a singularity have a tangential velocity""? As it turns out, Kerr black holes don't have point singularities, they have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_singularity"" rel=""noreferrer"">ring singularities</a>. These are ""rings"" of mass with zero width but some finite radius. Almost like a disk of no height. These rings of course can then have a tangential velocity. You were correct to be suspicious of a point singularity having tangential velocity though. That is not possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They did say that the event horizon at maximum spin of a stellar black hole is about 1-1/2 km. and that if a black hole were to spin faster then the result would be a ""naked black hole"" that would defy the laws of physics (GR).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know the equation exactly, since I defined it above. The radius of a stellar black hole (that is a black hole with mass exactly equal to the mass of the Sun, $M_\odot$) is given by</p>

<p>$$r=\frac{GM_{\odot}}{c}=1.48\:km$$</p>

<p>So yes, they were correct on their radius. They also state that spinning any faster results in a naked singularity. This is entirely true. To see this, go back to the equation for the event horizon. Remember that our upper spin limit is that $a=M$. What happens to our event horizon radius when $a&gt;M$ (and thus $a/M&gt;1$)? For arguments say, lets say $a=2M$. Then our event horizon radius becomes</p>

<p>$$r_e=M-(M^2-a^2)^{1/2}=M-(M^2-4M^2)^{1/2}=M-(-3M^2)^{1/2}=M-i\sqrt{3}M$$</p>

<p>Suddenly our radius is complex and has an imaginary component! That means it is not physical and thus <em>cannot exist</em>. Now that we don't have an event horizon, our singularity can't hide behind it and is ""naked"", exposed to the universe for anyone to see. GR tells us such an event shouldn't be allowed to happen because it results in all sorts of violations of physics. So somehow, something has to prevent black holes from spinning faster than a maximal black hole.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shouldn't all black holes spin extremely fast (conservation of angular momentum) or would a retrograde accretion disk slow it down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that is true in general. All black holes should spin extremely fast, simply because of conservation of angular momentum. In fact, I don't think I can come up with a case where a black hole was found to be not spinning. Shown below is a plot from <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/spin-rate-of-black-holes-pinned-down-1.13512"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Nature paper</a> which shows the measured spin of 19 supermassive black holes. They're all spinning pretty fast with some of them almost at the speed of light. None of them are even close to not spinning.</p>

<p>Also, can an amateur astronomer visualize this radiation in some way so as to be able to observe it?</p>
","<p>Cosmic rays consist of both electromagnetic radiation (i.e. photons) of different frequencies (radio waves, IR, light, UV light, x-rays, gamma rays), as well as charged particles (protons, electrons, maybe even ions of light elements), and other stuff like neutrinos. </p>

<p>The vast majority of the radiation we encounter around earth will be from the sun, because it is so very close and basically a large radiating blob. Usually with isotropic (equally in all directions) radiating sources, the radiation intensity falls of with the square of the distance. That means radiation diminishes very, very fast. Go twice as far from the sun, and you only get a fourth of the radiation.</p>

<p>The EM radiation from UV and up (X-rays and gamma rays) is probably the most harmful. The earth's magnetic field shields us from these rays, but interplanetary travel will not have this benefit. X-rays and gamma rays may also come from supernovae and other stellar objects, which are far away, but will probably be much too faint to have an effect on astronauts. However, it can be picked up by sensitive specialized telescopes and satellites.</p>

<p>The charged particles may be a problem to spacecrafts and electronics onboard them, but can probably be dampened by shielding in the spacecraft, as to protect the astronauts. </p>

<p>Neutrinos are I think of no concern, since they hardly interact with other matter.</p>

<p>As an amateur, you will have problems detecting UV and above. Mainly because we are mostly shielded from this kind of radiation by the magnetosphere and the atmosphere. </p>

","<p>The apparent magnitude classification was done arbitrarily by Ptolemy. His thought was to set the 20 brightest stars to the first position, the less bright stars to the second position and so on up to the faintest stars which were given the sixth position. After the use of Pogson's law we were able to give to stars not only natural numbers, but also numbers with decimal digits. When we started to use the first telescopes, we realised that the numbers which are greater than 6 have meaning. So the natural limit of naked eye is the apparent magnitude of +6. <a href=""http://www.inquinamentoluminoso.it/dmsp/starvis.html"">Here</a> you can find a nice work from the italian Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute which shows as the typical limit of naked eye compared to the light pollution of each area.</p>

"Why are orbits elliptical instead of circular?","978","","<p>Why do planets rotate around a star in a specific elliptical orbit with the star at one of it's foci? Why isn't the orbit a circle?</p>
","<p>Assume the planet has a negligible mass compared to the star, that both are spherically symmetric (so Newton's law of gravitation holds, but this normally happens to a very good approximation anyway), and that there aren't any forces besides the gravity between them. If the first condition does not hold, then the acceleration of each is going to be towards the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinates_%28astronomy%29"">barycenter</a> of the system, as if barycenter was attracting them a gravitational force with a certain reduced mass, so the problem is mathematically equivalent.</p>

<p>Take the star to be at the origin. By Newton's law of gravitation, the force is $\mathbf{F} = -\frac{m\mu}{r^3}\mathbf{r}$, where $\mathbf{r}$ is the vector to the planet, $m$ is its mass, and $\mu = GM$ is the standard gravitational parameter of the star.</p>

<h2>Conservation Laws</h2>

<p>Because the force is purely radial $(\mathbf{F}\parallel\mathbf{r})$, angular momentum $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}$ is conserved:
$$\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}\right) = m(\dot{\mathbf{r}}\times \dot{\mathbf{r}}) + \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}\text{.}$$
If the initial velocity is nonzero and the star is at the origin, then in terms of the initial position and velocity, the orbit must be confined to the plane of all points with vectors $\mathbf{x}$ from the origin that satisify $\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{x} = 0$. If the initial velocity is zero, then the motion is purely radial, and we can take any one of infinitely many planes that contain the barycenter and initial position.</p>

<p>The total orbital energy is given by
$$\mathcal{E} = \frac{p^2}{2m} - \frac{m\mu}{r}\text{,}$$
where the first term part is the kinetic energy and the second term is the gravitational potential energy of the planet. Its conservation, as well as the fact that it invokes the correct potential energy, can be proven by the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals.</p>

<p>Define the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector to be
$$\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{L} - \frac{m^2\mu}{r}\mathbf{r}\text{.}$$
It is also conserved:
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot{\mathbf{A}} &amp;=&amp; \mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{L} + \mathbf{p}\times\dot{\mathbf{L}} - \frac{m\mu}{r}\mathbf{p} + \frac{m\mu}{r^3}(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r})\mathbf{r}\\
&amp;=&amp; -\frac{m\mu}{r^3}\underbrace{\left(\mathbf{r}\times(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p})\right)}_{(\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{p})\mathbf{r} - r^2\mathbf{p}} - \frac{m\mu}{r}\mathbf{p} + \frac{m\mu}{r^3}(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r})\mathbf{r}\\
&amp;=&amp; \mathbf{0}\text{.}
\end{eqnarray*}$$</p>

<p>Finally, let's also take $\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{A}/(m\mathcal{E})$, which has the same units as $\mathbf{r}$, and since $\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{f} = 0$, it lies along the orbital plane. As it's a conserved vector scaled by a conserved scalar, it's easy to show that $\mathbf{f}$ is conserved as well, as long as $\mathcal{E}\neq 0$.</p>

<h2>Simplifying</h2>

<p>By employing the vector triple product, we can write
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{m}\mathbf{A} &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{m}\left[p^2\mathbf{r}-(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r})\mathbf{p}\right] -\frac{m\mu}{r}\mathbf{r}\\
&amp;=&amp; \left(\mathcal{E}+\frac{p^2}{2m}\right)\mathbf{r} - \frac{1}{m}\left(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}\right)\mathbf{p}\\
\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{f}-\mathbf{r}) &amp;=&amp; \left(\frac{p^2}{2m}\right)\mathbf{r} - \frac{1}{m}\left(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}\right)\mathbf{p}\text{,}
\end{eqnarray*}$$
the norm-squared of which is easy to crank out:
$$\mathcal{E}^2|\mathbf{f}-\mathbf{r}|^2 = \left(\mathcal{E} + \frac{m\mu}{r}\right)^2r^2\text{,}$$
where $\mathcal{E}$ was used throughout to switch between kinetic and potential terms.</p>

<h3>Why Ellipses?</h3>

<p>Since $\mathcal{E}$ is energy relative to infinity, to have a bound orbit we need $\mathcal{E}&lt;0$. Thus, from the previous section, $|\mathbf{f}-\mathbf{r}| = -\mathcal{E}^{-1}\left(\mathcal{E}r + m\mu\right)$ and therefore
$$|\mathbf{f}-\mathbf{r}| + |\mathbf{r}| = -\frac{m\mu}{\mathcal{E}}\text{,}$$
which defines an ellipse with foci $\mathbf{0},\,\mathbf{f}$ and major axis $2a=-m\mu/\mathcal{E}$.</p>

<h3>Why Not Circles?</h3>

<p>The circle is a special case where the foci are the same point, $\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{0}$, which can be restated as
$$\mathcal{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{m\mu}{r} = -\frac{p^2}{2m}\text{.}$$
In other words, circular orbits require the orbital energy to be the negative of the kinetic energy. This is possible, but almost certain not to hold exactly. Since any values of $\mathcal{E}&lt;0$ are allowed for bound orbits, there are many more ways to have elliptic orbits. (Although some of them would actually crash because the star and planet have positive size.)</p>

<p>Note that hyperbolic orbits have $\mathcal{E}&gt;0$, and we can still find the foci using the above method, though being careful with the signs. For $\mathcal{E}=0$, the second focus $\mathbf{f}$ is undefined because this is a parabolic orbit, and parabolas only have one focus within a finite distance from the center.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <em>eccentricity vector</em> $\mathbf{e} = \mathbf{A}/(m^2\mu)$ is an alternative choice for the LRL vector; as the name suggests, its magnitude is the orbital eccentricity.</p>

"What is at the edge of the galaxy?","977","","<p>The solar system is thought to have a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere#Heliopause"" rel=""nofollow"">heliopause</a> which can be considered its edge for many purposes:</p>

<blockquote>The heliopause is the theoretical boundary where the Sun's solar wind is stopped by the interstellar medium; where the solar wind's strength is no longer great enough to push back the stellar winds of the surrounding stars. This is the boundary where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heliopause: the boundary between solar wind and interstellar wind where they are in equilibrium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a similar phenomenon at the interface between space dominated by the Milky Way and intergalactic space?</p>

<p><strong>What is at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy?</strong></p>
","<p>The short answer is: probably nothing much, because galaxies are very fuzzy objects without ""edges"".</p>

<p>If you look at the stellar disk, it just fades out in density, with no evidence for a sharp cutoff (this is true of disk galaxies in general). There may or may not be a ""break"" at some radius, but this just marks the beginning of a steeper falloff in density, not an ""edge"" in any real sense. The <em>gas</em> disk extends even further out (that is, further out than we can easily trace the stars in the disk), and doesn't show much evidence for a sharp cutoff either.</p>

<p>There's also a round halo of stars, which is low density but extends to at least 400,000 light years; <a href=""http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/the-most-distant-milky-way-stars-070920142/"" rel=""nofollow"">two stars were recently discovered</a>  which are plausibly part of the halo and located at distances of about 800,000 light years. (Note that there are <em>other galaxies</em> -- such as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds -- which are closer to us and to the center of the Milky Way, so you have to accept that individual galaxies can be found ""inside"" other galaxies.)</p>

<p>And then there's the halo of dark matter...</p>

<p>I can think of two ways in which you <em>might</em> talk about the outer boundary of an isolated galaxy (which the Milky Way sort of is) from a theoretical perspective. The first is the idea of a halo ""accretion shock"", in which relatively cold gas falling onto the galaxy from intergalactic space runs into the galaxy's halo of hot gas (""hot"" = millions of degrees), creating a shock where the infalling gas slows down and the local density of gas goes up. (This is a little bit analogous to the heliopause, though the direction of gas flow is the other way around: the heliopause is where the outflowing solar wind shocks into the more or less stationary interstellar gas.) The problem is that extensive, hot halos of gas are thought to form only around <em>massive</em> galaxies, and it's not clear the Milky Way is massive enough to qualify. It also won't work for galaxies in massive groups and clusters, where the individual galaxies aren't accreting gas any more (the <em>cluster</em> is what has the hot halo and the accretion shock).</p>

<p>The other possibility is a region where the infalling <em>dark matter</em> particles merge into the dark-matter halo (whose particles are orbiting within their common gravitational potential, and so are not <em>as a whole</em> falling towards the center any more). Simulations suggest that as one moves inward the local density of dark matter starts to increase rather rapidly at this point (and the average velocity of the dark matter particles changes), but it's still a fairly smooth process (unlike gas, the dark matter particles aren't ""shocking"" into each other). There's no way of determining where this is for the Milky Way, other than something really vague like ""maybe 1 million light years""?</p>

"Explaining Dark Matter and Dark Energy to layman","964","","<p>With my little knowledge, I know this:</p>

<p><strong>Dark Matter</strong></p>

<p>The center of a galaxy controls/attracts its objects (stars, planets, comets etc.) towards itself because of gravity. But the mass of the center of this galaxy appears to be less than what it should take to attract all objects of the galaxy. Hence Dark Matter is there, which makes this attraction or controlling possible.</p>

<p><strong>Dark Energy</strong></p>

<p>This is the force which is pulling galaxies away from each other, and hence making the universe expand. If we don't have this hypothetical force, we cannot explain why distances between galaxies are increasing.</p>

<p><strong><em>Question</em></strong></p>

<p>Please let me know how far I am from the actual meaning/definition of these terms? And how can I explain these to a layman, who has no or very little knowledge about astronomy?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>P.S.: I have read <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/675/how-do-we-know-dark-matter-dark-energy-exists"">this question here</a>, which is excellent but I could not get an idea of how to explain to a layman.</p>
","<p><strong>Dark Matter</strong>
Your understanding of dark matter isn't bad, but here's a few clarifying details.
Orbits: The speed of an object's orbit is related to 2 things: the radius of its orbit and the mass inside of it. In the solar system, over 99% of the mass is concentrated at the centre, so radius is the dominant effect on orbital speed. As we look at planets further away from the sun, their orbital speed decreases. In the galaxy, it's a similar story, but with increasing orbital radius, you're also getting more and more mass inside of your orbit since the galaxy is full of other stars. Even so, we would expect orbital speeds to drop as you look at objects toward the edge of the galaxy, since the stars get more diffuse as you move out and not enough mass is inside the orbit to compensate for the increasing radius. Instead, we see that after a certain point, the orbital speeds stay the same, suggesting that there is more mass there than we can account for with stars and other visible objects.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a so-called rotation curve of the <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985ApJ...295..305V"" rel=""noreferrer"">spiral galaxy NGC 3198</a>:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2jsX9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Without dark matter, we would expect the speed of objects as a function of radius (from the center of mass) to follow the curve labeled 'disk'. However, what we see appears to be the sum of the two contributions (the disk and the 'dark matter halo' which surrounds this disk), which is overplotted with actual data.</p>

<p>We also have evidence of this extra mass from gravitational lenses. As light passes by a large object like a galaxy cluster, its path can get bent by that object's gravity. We can see this effect when a galaxy cluster is in front of an even more distant galaxy, the light from the background object gets magnified and distorted. We can calculate the path the light must have taken to appear as we see it, and the mass needed to bend it that way can't be accounted for with just the stars and gas we see in the lensing cluster. This again suggests that there is extra mass that we can't see. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gaAuX.jpg"" alt=""Here&#39;s a great picture from CFHT showing how gravity lensing works.""></p>

<p><strong>Dark Energy</strong>
You're not too far off with this one, with one major distinction: Dark energy is the 'force' that's causing the universe to <em>accelerate</em> its expansion. We expect the universe to be expanding from the Big Bang cosmology model, but we'd expect it to be slowing down as the mutual gravity of everything in the universe acted upon each other. Dark energy appears to be a ""pressure"" on every part of space to expand, but it's very weak and has been dominated by gravity and other factors throughout most of the universe's history. It's only in the past few billion years it's started to take over.</p>

<p>It works something like this. Imagine you have a 1-D region of spacetime 1 unit long (just for convenience's sake). Here it is: |--------|
Now this region has this dark energy 'expansion pressure' acting on it. Let's say it's 0.07 units per year per unit. This means that every year, this region of spacetime gets bigger by 7%. In 10 years, the length will be double:
|--------|--------|
Now the thing is, each of these regions has the same expansion pressure as the original one! So both will double in 10 years, and then those will double, and so on. So what happens is you get a small expansion locally, but the further away something gets the faster it's accelerating away from you. The real effect of dark energy is orders of magnitude smaller, something like 67.15 ± 1.2 (km/s)/Mpc (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space#How_is_the_expansion_of_the_universe_measured_and_how_does_the_rate_of_expansion_change.3F"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>), but it still means that any galaxies more than 4.5 Gigaparsecs away from us are currently being carried away from us faster than the speed of light. (We can still see them right now because the light we see was emitted long before the expansion rate got that high.) The expansion adds up over the huge distances we see in the universe.</p>

<p>Dark energy doesn't affect things like planets, solar systems, and galaxies because the effect is so weak on small scales that gravity more than counteracts it. It's effect can mostly be seen over the vast empty stretches of space between galaxy clusters.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_gravity"">Neutron star's compactness gives it a surface gravity of up to 7×10^12 m/s²</a>, and expanding from 20km to ~70 billion km (or 300000km when c limit is considered) over the course of 1 second constitutes an explosion.

"Definition of stellar core?","957","","<p>This is a basic question, but I may as well ask it. I had always thought that the core of a main-sequence star is defined as the part hot enough for nuclear fusion. Some dictionaries seem to agree with this.</p>

<p>However, many books say that protostars and pre-main-sequence stars also have cores, though they are not undergoing hydrogen fusion.</p>

<p>So what exactly is the definition of a stellar core? If it doesn't necessarily have to be hot enough for fusion, what separates it from the rest of the star?</p>
","<p>I think that there isn't a strict answer to this question. However, I believe the answer is that there's a difference between the core of a hydrogen-burning star and the core of a protostar or star-forming, gas cloud.</p>

<p>For a hydrogen-burning star, the core, as you say, is the region of the star where fusion is taking place. This is surrounded by the radiative and convective zones (which one comes first depends on the mass of the star). For true stars, the concept of the core is well defined.</p>

<p>For things like protostars and star-forming gas clouds, the concept of the core is less well defined and more a nomenclature for a region of the object rather than a strict definition. I don't think it is correct to assume that because one is talking about the core of a protostar, that they are referring to the core as it is defined for a hydrogen-burning star.</p>

<p>So what does it mean to be a core in a protostar or star-forming gas cloud? I will first point out that protostars can still be fusing. In the pre-main sequence stage, most stars will be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium_fusion"">fusing deuterium</a> and we can consider the core to be the region where this is occurring. A protostar does not become a fully fledged star until it begins hydrogen burning, but deuterium fusion requires lower temperatures and pressures than the full proton-proton chain of hydrogen fusion (of which deuterium fusion is a part) and so can occur in protostars.</p>

<p>We might also distinguish a core from outer regions based on a density or compositional change. If we plot up something like the density (or really any property that changes with radius), we are likely to see a drastic jump signifying some sort of boundary. Cores for star-forming regions may be defined by highly dense regions, high temperature regions, or regions ""where the physics changes"" because we've passed some critical threshold at some radius. These cores are less well defined and can't be likened to stellar cores very well.</p>

The usual classification is called MKK (from the astronomers that had developed it - Morgan, Keenan and Kellman in 1943), and divides the stars in 7 stellar types O, B, A, F, G, K, M. Please note that from the 1943 other stellar types have added, but these are the most used. This sequence goes from the hottest (O) to coolest (M) stars. Each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with 0 being hottest and 9 being coolest. Our Sun is a G2 type star. This classification also uses an additional notation to avoid the ""degeneracy"" you mentioned: a roman numeral between ""I"" (one) and ""V"" (five). The higher the number, the wider the lines in the observed spectrum. However, despite of the quantity these roman numbers indicate, they are an index of <strong>luminosity class</strong>. This is based on the width of certain absorption lines in the star's spectrum which vary with the density of the atmosphere and so distinguish giant stars from dwarfs. Luminosity class I stars are supergiants, class III regular giants, and class V dwarfs or main-sequence stars, with II for bright giants, IV for sub-giants, and VI for sub-dwarfs (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from here</a>).

","<p>To get into scientific fields as a professional pretty much requires a doctorate these days.  This can be in astronomy or your chosen specialty (see below), but many are also in physics; what the subject is called may depend on the institution you attend to get the Ph.D.</p>

<p>Realize that what you and the general public thinks of as ""Astronomy"" is likely not the same as what the professional scientific world calls ""Astronomy"".  An ""Astronomer"" studies stars and groupings of stars.  Someone who studies our Sun is usually called a ""Solar Physicist"" or something similar.  Someone who studies other planets is a ""Planetary Scientist""; this can be further subdivided into ""Atmospheric Scientist"" (which can be even further divided into ""Atmospheric Chemist"", ""Atmospheric Dynamicist"", etc.) and ""Planetary Geologist"", and so on.  A scientist studying the origins of the universe is a ""Cosmologist"".

I'd recommend a semester or two of introductory astronomy, although some schools don't consider that as absolutely necessary, surprisingly. Other useful undergraduate courses will depend on what you think you will want to specialize in, but would include more physics, more astronomy, chemistry, geology, meteorology, etc.</p>

"Is the Drake Equation an accurate way of finding the probability of life on planets?","936","","<p>I was interested in finding out if there was life on any planets or moons. I saw ReNiSh A R's question, and I saw the answer about there being life on Europa, but it didn't accurately answer what I wanted to find out.</p>

<p>The Drake Equation is on: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation</a>.</p>

<p>I have also heard that there could possibly be life in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, which could have floating beasts, and also on Titan, which does have surface liquids, but I am pretty sure most of it is in solid form.</p>

<p>If the Drake Equation is equal to a low number, then why is it pretty common if there is a possibility of life on 2 moons and 1 planet? Does that make the Drake Equation a non-reliable source?</p>

<p>I'm also looking for an accurate answer, so can you please give it to me in detail!</p>
","<p>The Drake equation is little more than a randomly assembled guess of relevant factors for intelligent life, and any use of it requires a number of hard to justify guesses for the various probabilities.</p>

<p>It is otherwise an attempt to give a foundation for making Fermi estimations on the number of civilizations, and the associated Fermi paradox. A Fermi estimation is an order of magnitude estimate. It doesn't try to get a particularly accurate estimate, it only tries to tell you how many digits you can expect the answer to have. And the Fermi paradox is simply stated as ""There is an absurd number of stars. So absurd that finding extraterrestrial life should be easy. But in fact it is hard. Why?""</p>

<p>The resolution to the paradox is the second sentence: it assumes we have reasonable basis to suppose life is easy enough for the sheer number of stars to give us lots of observable life. We do not. The Drake equation is in one sense a way of singling out as many factors as possible so we have a concrete goal to figure those factors out, and so the entire problem.</p>

<p>But mostly it is used by pop science and sensationalists to rile us up with lines like ""there should be thousands of civilizations more advanced than ours in our own galaxy!"" and ""there could be life in Jupiter's atmosphere."" These things have no solid science behind them, and are just attention grabbers dressed in pseudoscience.</p>

"Point Spread Function size: Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) vs Sigma","930","","<p>I having been studying some astronomy papers related to galaxy observations and I realized that every time they want to express the size of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of a system which can be approximated by Gaussian they use the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) and not the sigma. Is there a reason behind that? </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>FWHM is the indicator of the width of a Gaussian that is easiest to measure, and is least error prone in terms of actual physical measurement (due to the slope of a Gaussian being the highest near half maximum - not exactly sure about this, but it does seem like that's the case - so error in y contributes least in the measurement of width, relatively. If this is not clear, look at a noisy Gaussian - something like this: <a href=""http://www.astronomie-amateur.fr/Documents_Supernovae/Mesure_Vexp_gauss.PNG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.astronomie-amateur.fr/Documents_Supernovae/Mesure_Vexp_gauss.PNG</a> - and you'll know what I mean. It seems most sensible to estimate width using FWHM). And it has a simple correlation to the sigma with a factor of 2.35 if the distribution is actually Gaussian (which is often the assumption for PSFs - correct me if I'm wrong). Measuring actual standard deviation of data with errors is much more complicated than just simply measuring FWHM, and often it is enough to know the FWHM estimate.

"What gases are needed to make a star?","930","","<p>What gases do you need to start the creation of a star, and why do you need these gases? What are their functions?</p>
","<p>It depends on the kind of star you want to make.</p>

<p>Basically, what you really need is hydrodgen; as soon as enough hydrodgen is gathered somewhere and collapse, you end up with a star.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong>, if you just have hydrodgen, you will get a very massive star, and with a history different than the stars observed in the local Universe. Why so?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/swas/science1.html"">hydrodgen is a poor coolant</a>, therefore the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans_instability#Jeans_mass"">Jeans' mass</a> (the minimum mass for a density structure to gravitationally collapse), which strongly depends on temperature, will be much higher if the temperature is higher. In practice, it means that the formed stars will be much more massive.</li>
<li>you need at least a small fraction of carbon to launch the CNO cycle in stellar cores (CNO cycle is one of the two ways to burn hydrodgen and to turn it into helium); stellar cores are then hotter and denser, and stars become hotter and more luminous.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you want to make a star as we typically observe in our galaxy, you will need also some molecules (hopefully <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_interstellar_and_circumstellar_molecules"">there are plenty of them</a>) and also some carbon.

"Why does gravity increase in star formation?","930","","<p>When a star ignites ( ie. fusion starts ), the star maintains its form by balancing gravity's inward pressure, and radiation's outward pressure.</p>

<p>I get that the fusion of hydrogen atoms releases energy... fine...</p>

<p>How does gravity keep it together if the mass is lessening as a result of fusion( mass being converted into energy from fusion) while gravity is weakening( as mass lessens )?</p>

<p>Wouldn't the radiation overpower the force of gravity and tear the star apart?</p>
","<h2>I am going to start with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion#Nuclear_fusion_in_stars"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this paragraph from Wikipedia</a> <em>(emphasis mine)</em>:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important fusion process in nature is the one that powers
  stars. In the 20th century, it was realized that the energy released
  from nuclear fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of the Sun
  and other stars as a source of heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in
  a star, starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance,
  provides that energy and synthesizes new nuclei as a byproduct of that
  fusion process. <strong><em>The prime energy producer in the Sun is the fusion of
  hydrogen to form helium</em></strong>, which occurs at a solar-core temperature of
  14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four protons into
  one alpha particle, with the release of two positrons, two neutrinos
  (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy.
  Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the
  star. For stars the size of the sun or smaller, the <strong><em>proton-proton
  chain</em></strong> dominates. In heavier stars, the <strong><em>CNO cycle</em></strong> is more important.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>The <strong><em>proton-proton chain</em></strong> set of reactions look like this:</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PLExf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PLExf.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Net Result</h2>

<p>Either way, the net result is 4 protons ($^1\!$H nuclei) are turned into 1 alpha particle ($^4\!$He nucleus) plus 2 positrons (e$^+$). The 2 positrons go on to annihilate 2 electrons, so altogether we have a mass change of $$ \Delta M = M_{\mathsf \alpha} - 2M_{\mathsf e} - 4M_{\mathsf P}\,. $$ </p>

<p>Let's find out the fractional change in mass: $$ f_\Delta = \frac{\Delta M}{4M_{\mathsf P}} = \frac{M_{\mathsf \alpha} - 2M_{\mathsf e} - 4M_{\mathsf P}}{4M_{\mathsf P}}\,. $$</p>

<p>Now <a href=""http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?malsmp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the ratio of the mass of an alpha particle to a proton is $3.9726$</a>, or $$ M_{\mathsf \alpha} = 3.9726\times M_{\mathsf P}\,. $$</p>

<p><a href=""http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?mpsme"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The ratio of the mass of a proton to an electron is $1836.1$</a>, or $$ M_{\mathsf e} = \frac{M_{\mathsf P}}{1836.1} = 0.0005446\times M_{\mathsf P}\,. $$</p>

<p>Substituting into the $f_\Delta$ equation, $$ f_\Delta = \frac{3.9726\times M_{\mathsf P} - 0.0011\times M_{\mathsf P} - 4\times M_{\mathsf P}}{4\times M_{\mathsf P}} = \frac{-0.0285}4 = -0.007125 = -0.7125\%\,\,.$$</p>

<p>So obviously, Even if <em>all</em> of the hydrogen were converted (only a fraction actually is) the loss of mass to the star would be too negligible to matter.</p>

<hr>

<p>A more important mass loss for large stars is that from their <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stellar wind</a>, which for very large main sequence stars (types O or B) removes a sizable <strong><em>fraction</em></strong> of the very large star's mass over it's lifetime.</p>

","<p>The objects you are refering to are actually two different objects: asteroids and comets. Meteor and meteorite are other names for an asteroid, at a given time of its interaction with our planet. We'll get to that.</p>

<p>So first, what is the difference between an asteroid and a comet?</p>

<p>A <strong>comet</strong> is a small solar system body that display a ""coma"" (an atmosphere of a sort) and sometimes a tail passing close to the Sun. They are mostly made of ice and dust, as well as some small rocky particles. We distinguish two kind of comets, with short or long orbital period.

The long orbital period ones originated from the Oort cloud, a scattered disk of icy planetesimals and small bodies laying around our solar system.</p>

<p>An <strong>asteroid</strong> is a small body, composed mostly of rocks and metals. In our solar system, they can be originated from the asteroid belt, laying between Mars and Jupiter, or from the orbit of Jupiter (the Jupiter Trojans), or from actually almost everywhere in the Solar System. </p>

  <p>The total supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be about 4.6 per century, or one every 22 years, although <strong>we haven't actually observed one</strong> for several centuries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds like a freak occurrence to me.</p>

<p>It made me curious about the numbers so I refreshed my knowledge on the Poisson distribution. It is not specified how many centuries we have not seen a supernova, but let's assume it's only two.</p>

<p>If on average 9.2 supernovae happen per 2 centuries then the chance of having exactly 9 in any two century period can be calculated with:</p>

<p>$$p(k) = {\lambda^k \times e^{-\lambda} \over k!}$$</p>

<p>Filling in $k=9$,</p>

<p>$$p(9) = {9.2^9 \times e^{-9.2} \over 9!}=0.1315$$</p>

<p>The chance that there is not a single supernova in a two century period is:</p>

<p>$$p(0) = {9.2^0 \times e^{-9.2} \over 0!}=0.00010104$$</p>

<p>That's about a 1 in 10,000 chance. If ""several"" means 3 centuries, then the chance of not having any supernova is as little as 1 in 100,000.</p>

<p>So from this I can only come to the conclusion that supernovae did in fact happen in the Milky Way in the last two centuries, but that we didn't <em>see</em> any of them.</p>

<p>But now I'm confused. I read about supernovae that have happened in galaxies billions of light-years from here that lit up as the brightest source of light in the sky for days. Surely we would be able to see <em>all</em> of the supernovae that happen in our Milky Way (no more the 100,000 light years away) with the naked eye, let alone with telescopes?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>One problem with estimating how many supernovae have happened in the Milky Way in the last two centuries, is that the remnant from a supernova is far dimmer than the nova itself and far harder to find. Several supernovae could have happened in the Milky Way in the last 2 centuries and remain undiscovered — and just for clarity, we define the date of a supernova by the date the light from the explosion reaches the Earth, so saying saying a nova ""happened"" in the last 200 years refers to the date the light from the event reached Earth, not the actual date of the event, which you probably already know, but just to clarify. </p>

<p>So for argument's sake, let's say that a supernova's light reached the Earth about 50 years ago, but it took place on the far side of the galaxy. To find that, we'd have to look for a nebula on the far side of the galaxy and that's a hard thing to see. Similar to looking for the theoretical Planet Nine, finding old supernova remnants on the other side of the Milky Way takes a lot of looking. Even with modern telescopes, it's still a needle in a haystack, and especially if the view is blocked by dust like much of the Milky Way is.</p>

<p>A Milky Way supernova remnant was discovered in 1985, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1.9%2B0.3"" rel=""nofollow"">supernova remnant G1.9+0.3</a>. It was thought to have ""happened"" around 1868, though it went unobserved and probably wasn't visible to the naked eye at the time.   There's probably been several others more recent than that one.  G1.9+0.3 would have been visible if not for interstellar dust. From article above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a type Ia supernova believed to have exploded about 25,000
  years ago, and the signal began reaching Earth around 1868. The light
  from the supernova would have been visible to 19th century
  astronomers, had it not been obscured by the dense gas and dust of the
  Galactic Center.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure the 4.6 supernovae per century from your article is accurate. It might be, but the number I'm used to hearing is about one per century. But regardless of which number is actually correct, it still doesn't imply high mathematical improbability because many Milky Way novae would have gone unnoticed if they were far enough away. In short, I agree with what you said here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can only come to the conclusion that supernovae did in fact happen in the Milky Way in the last two centuries, but that we didn't see any of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's a related <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/120006/why-cant-we-see-the-center-of-the-milky-way/"" rel=""nofollow"">article on Milky Way visibility</a>.</p>

<p>Observation of a distant galaxy nova is possible if we have telescopes looking in that direction. A nova is much more detectable at the time it goes nova.  Much less so, years later.</p>

<p>Today, however, with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_Early_Warning_System"" rel=""nofollow"">neutrino detection in 7 locations around the globe</a>, I think it's virtually impossible that we'd miss a supernova in the Milky Way, so we have a good chance of seeing one in our lifetime and it's likely that none have occurred since somewhere around 1980. A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A#Neutrino_emissions"" rel=""nofollow"">supernova was detected in the Andromeda galaxy in 1987</a> by that method, and our neutrino detection has improved since then to give us early warning and pinpoint location.</p>

<p>As far as visibility, size matters, but what matters more is how close and how much dust is in the way. Most of the recorded supernovae were quite bright and fairly noticeable to someone who was familiar with the stars in the sky (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supernovae#List"" rel=""nofollow"">list of known supernovae</a>).</p>

<p>Eight Milky Way novae have been recorded by history and observed by the naked eye in the last 2,000 years, well below the number that should have happened in that time. Five of those eight had brightness greater than $-3$, which is brighter than Jupiter and would have been immediately noticed by anyone familiar with star charting. Two others had magnitudes around zero, which is still brighter than most stars. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_386"" rel=""nofollow"">SN386</a> was less bright, but is still easily visible and recorded by Chinese astronomers. And finally, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_A"" rel=""nofollow"">Cassiopeia A</a> was quite dim, but it was still observable. Only about 10% (ballpark estimate) of the Milky Way is close enough and unobstructed enough to provide supernovae that would visibly get noticed.  Most would have gone unnoticed until recently.</p>

"Can Liquid Water exist on Mars?","919","","<p>Outside of a specially crafts environment, could liquid water exist on Mars? Not some time in the distant past, but within the last few years. Mars' atmosphere is too thin for water to exist, right?</p>

<p>Perhaps if the water was mixed with salts or other minerals, its sublimation point might be altered enough to exist? Mars can get warm during its summer days, up to about 20 degrees Celsius at the equator. Perhaps, in certain areas and time periods, we may get a kind of liquid water?</p>

<p>Sorry for the speculative nature of this question, but after NASA talked about the possibility of liquid water, it got me wondering if it was possible.</p>
","<p>Liquid water can in principle exist at many locations on present-day Mars, but there are a few interesting twists to the story.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>At low elevation, the atmospheric pressure is high enough. The triple point pressure of H2O is 611 Pascal, which corresponds to about mid-elevation. At low elevations, such as the northern lowlands, the atmospheric pressure will exceed the triple point pressure, so the liquid phase of H2O becomes possible.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be substantial ""sublimation cooling"" or evaporative cooling. When the partial pressure of H2O is almost as high as the total pressure, vapor rapidly escapes into the atmosphere, which takes a lot of energy. If you put an ice cube at the equator of Mars, it will not melt, because the sublimation cooling is larger than the incoming solar energy, even at noon.</p></li>
<li><p>However, if that ice cube is covered with a thin layer of dust, or contains dust that will accumulate on top as the ice sublimates, vapor loss will be reduced. In this circumstance, ice can melt to form liquid water. </p></li>
<li><p>That leaves the question of how the ice cube would have gotten there initially. I call it the ""source problem"". Places on Mars that get hot have already lost all their ice, and places on Mars that have ice do not get warm enough. So, it is difficult to get liquid water on Mars, but it is possible in principle.</p></li>
<li><p>With salts, which lower the melting point, everything becomes much easier, although supplies of ice/frost and salt are needed. When water with salt evaporates, the salt concentration increases, so the solution is driven toward the eutectic point, where the melting point suppression is the strongest.</p></li>

"What would be the practical consequences (on earth) if the Moon was not tidally locked?","914","","<p>I was thinking about the fact that all the largest Solar System moons are tidally locked to its primary and this question arose.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What would be the practical consequences (on earth) if the Moon was
  not tidally locked?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I think the consequences would be pretty small, except we'd see the dark side of the moon from time to time.   On the moon, the consequences would be bigger.</p>

<p>All tidally locked means is that the moon's rotation matches the moon's orbit, so that the same side of the moon always faces the earth.  If the moon wasn't tidally locked, it would spin from our point of view.  The moon spinning wouldn't affect the earth hardly at all - at least, in no way I can see.</p>

<p>The reason most moons are tidally locked to their planets is because the planets gravitation on their moons is quite large.  Strong gravitation, or, strong tidal effects is perhaps more correct, slows down an orbiting objects rotation, so tidal locking of moons is common.  Tidal locking of planets - less so.   Both Pluto and it's moon Charon are tidally locked to each other cause they're pretty close to each other.    Mercury is also, nearly tidally locked to our sun.   </p>

<p>Now, Phuc's answer (uh, language please)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By being tidally locked, the Moon has been extending the Earth day by
  slowing down the Earth's spin, to about ~6 hours from an 18 hour day
  to a 24 hour day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As HDE pointed out, this isn't so.   It's the earth's rotation being ahead of the moon's orbit that's caused the earth to slow down.   The moon's tidal effect on the earth plays a role in that, but the Moon being tidally locked to the earth is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Also, the earth's spin was much much faster than an 18 hour day when the moon was young.   By this article, a day on earth was only a few hours long.   <a href=""http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/nasa-scientist-jen-heldmann-describes-how-the-earths-moon-was-formed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/nasa-scientist-jen-heldmann-describes-how-the-earths-moon-was-formed/</a></p>

<p>The earth, 4 billion years ago was spinning unusually fast for an object in our solar system.  It might help to consider what makes planets spin.  When they form, it's conservation of angular momentum, but according to the giant impact hypothesis, the earth was hit, not dead center but at an angle.   The giant impact that formed the moon also set the earth spinning very fast.   The moon was also very close when it formed - maybe just twice the Roche limit, so, that close, that the moon slowed the earth's spin and the (at the time) much larger tidal effects pulled on the moon, causing it to move farther away.   </p>

"How does angular resolution of a telescope translate to its parallax precision?","910","","<p>We can often read in the scientific and also more casual reader literature and articles about the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"" rel=""noreferrer"">angular resolution</a> of various telescopes and other optical equipment, be it ground based or onboard space probes. They would often list their angular resolution, or in other words, their ability to resolve or distinguish small, distant objects with today's digital era mostly on a per sensor pixel basis.</p>

","<p>Parallax measurement in practice is not as is explained above using the popular diagram you have used. The parallax causes the star to prescribe an ellipse in the sky, the semi-major axis of whose is equal to the parallactic angle. </p>

"Solar Noon: meridian crossing time versus time of maximum elevation","906","","<p>According to the first paragraph of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon"">Noon</a> Wikipedia page, <strong>solar noon</strong> is the moment when the Sun crosses the meridian and is at its highest elevation in the sky. The wording there suggests that there is an exact identity between the solar meridian crossing time and the solar maximum elevation time on a given day. However, later in same article in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon#Solar_noon"">Solar Noon</a> section it states that, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Solar noon is the moment when the Sun transits the celestial meridian – <strong><em>roughly</em></strong> the time when it is highest above the horizon on that day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>The use of the word ""roughly"" really surprised me. I was strongly under the impression that these times were necessarily equal for sub-polar regions. Am I wrong and missing something, or is the wiki article just poorly worded? </p>
","<p>There are a couple of things you have to think about in order to understand the problem at hand. The first is that there are three coordinate systems at play. The first is the celestial coordinate system, which is a coordinate system based upon the latitude and longitude of the Earth (the celestial equator is the Earth's equator projected out into space). See this <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/9/could-someone-explain-ra-dec-in-simple-terms/41#41"">post</a>. </p>

<p>The second coordinate system is that of the solar system: The plane of the solar system (which contains the sun and planets, and traces out a line in the sky called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ecliptic</a>). Now because of the tilt of the Earth's axis with respect to the normal vector of the plane of the solar system, the celestial equator is not the same as the ecliptic. What's more, is that the relative position of the ecliptic and the celestial equator change throughout the course of the year.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the altitude/azimuth coordinate system which locked to the observer. The zenith (the point at which all horizons are equidistant from the point you are looking at) is $+90^{\circ}$ in altitude and is a degenerate point in azimuth, and all horizons are $0^{\circ}$ altitude but lay on a unique azimuthal arc stemming from the zenith and intersecting the horizon.</p>

<p>Below is a diagram showing the relationship between the first two coordinate systems, the celestial coordinate system and the coordinate system of the solar system.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H1gLU.png"" alt=""eclipticdiagram""></p>

<p>Why does all of this matter for the question you've asked? It's because as you look due East and due West, you're looking at $0^{\circ}$ declination (the celestial equator intersects the horizon at exactly due East and due West) whereas the ecliptic intersects the horizon at different points. These points change throughout the year as the relative position of the ecliptic changes with respect to the celestial equator. Now, the amount the sun travels on the ecliptic over a 24 hour period is $0.9856^{\circ}$ ($360^{\circ}/365.25 \text{ days}$; actually I may want to use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time#Sidereal_time_and_solar_time"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sidereal day</a> here but nonetheless it's about a degree). </p>

<p>Due to this, there is potentially a little bit extra in altitude that the sun may travel throughout the course of a day (since the path of the ecliptic is neither aligned with the celestial coordinate system, nor aligned with the local alt/az coordinate system of the observer; unless you're at the north or south poles in which case your local alt/az coordinate system is the same as the celestial coordinate system, however both are still mis-aligned with the coordinate system of the solar system). I think the word ""approximate"" needs to be there. </p>

<p>All told, I don't personally know how to quantify the extra bit of altitude the sun may gain from the misalignment of the ecliptic with lines of constant altitude and from the sun's motion along the ecliptic, but I would welcome references and calculations from other people. This little bit extra may not be a really small number. In other words, you might want to see how the rate of change of altitude of the sun at that point changes simply due to the Earth's rotation and how it may compare to the rate of change of altitude due to the motion of the sun along the ecliptic. </p>

<p>EDIT: 
I also just looked to see what the ecliptic looks like on the sky (as seen from Philadelphia), and how it compares to the local alt/az coordinate system. Below is a picture with all coordinate systems present to try to illustrate the point I was trying to make.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1EtMA.png"" alt=""coordinatesystems""></p>

<p>The green line is the meridian, the orange(ish) lines are alt/az coordiantes, the blue line is the celestial equator, and the red line is the path of the ecliptic. Hopefully you can make this out sufficiently well.</p>

"Which are the most energetic events in the Universe?","906","","<p>That's the question. I know about gamma ray bursts, is there anything more energetic?</p>
","<p>Wikipedia has a page on this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy)</a>    </p>

<p>I would have guessed the recently observed merging of 2 black holes, which, while just hard to detect gravity waves, in terms of energy it was about the equivalent of the entire rest mass of our sun.  Two large (but not super-massive) black holes each about 30 solar masses, merged and released about 3 solar masses in energy in gravity waves.   That's a huge amount of energy.  </p>

<p>I'd have guessed wrong though, as an observed gamma ray burst was bigger.  (see link above for precise estimates).</p>

<p>In theory, since I assume you're talking about localized events, when 2 galaxies merge and their super-massive black holes collide, that's probably, hands down, the most energetic local event, far surpassing the largest gamma-ray bursts.  Gravity waves might not be what people think of as energetic, but they can be enormously so.    If you're talking more typical ""bright flash"", photons and accelerated particles, then the winner would be the largest gamma ray bursts.    Hypernova's are up there, but not as large as the largest Gamma-ray Bursts.</p>

<p>Now if you want to get flexible on what ""local"" means.  The gravitational energy of two large galaxies falling towards each other might get you a larger number, but I'm a little fuzzy on whether that qualifies as a local event"", which I've built this answer on.   </p>

"How strong is the force between the Sun and the centre of the Milky Way?","905","","<p>I know the Sun is orbiting around the Milky Way, but how strong is the attractive force between them (e.g. what is the order of magnitude in terms of newtons)?</p>
","<p>Galactic orbits are not Keplerian: There is not a single massive centre, whose gravity attracts the sun, rather the whole disc, and dark matter halo which surrounds the galaxy. We can't use the inverse square law to calculate the force of gravity without knowing the distribution of mass in the galaxy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Sun's orbit is roughly circular, so we can use kinematics to get some idea of the forces involved:  For circular motion $a=\frac{v^2}{r}$. The velocity of the sun is about <a href=""http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/AngelaChan.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">225000 m/s</a>, and we are at a radius of about 2.5e20 m from the centre. The formula above gives a very small centripetal acceleration of 2e-10 m/s²</p>

<p>However the sun is quite massive, 2e30 kg, so using $F=ma$, the force on the sun is of the order 4e20 N.  This is about 0.01 of the force acting on the Earth by the Sun. (3.6e22 N)</p>

"How do you calculate the effects of precession on elliptical orbits?","903","","<p>Kepler's first law states that planets (and all celestial bodies orbiting another body) travel in elliptical orbits, which have well-known formulas that make it relatively easy to calculate the orbital elements and associated behavior. However, ongoing precession means that the orbit is constantly changing - and so the planet isn't actually traveling in the ellipse it originally set out on! You can calculate precession and its related effects (<a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/7938/where-did-this-famous-planetary-precession-formula-come-from"">this question and answer</a> are helpful), but is there any way to calculate how the elliptical orbit will be ""deformed"" by precession?</p>
","<p>A good starting point would be &lt;insert name of some scientist from long ago&gt; planetary equations of motion. For example, there are Lagrange's planetary equations (sometimes called the Lagrange-Laplace planetary equations), Gauss' planetary equations, Delaunay's planetary equations, Hill's planetary equations, and several more. The common theme amongst these various planetary equations is that they yield the time derivatives of various orbital elements as a function of the partial derivatives of the perturbing force / perturbing potential with respect to some generalized position.</p>

<p>In general, the only words that can describe the result of this process at first is ""hot mess."" A hot mess did not deter those brilliant minds of old. Via various simplifying assumptions and long term time averaging, they came up with fairly simple descriptions of, for example, $\left \langle \frac{d\omega}{dt} \right\rangle$ (apsidal precession) and $\left \langle \frac{d\Omega}{dt} \right\rangle$ (planar precession). You can see some of this in the cited 1900 work by Hill below.</p>

<p>While these techniques are old, these planetary equations are still used today. That sometimes you do get a ""hot mess"" is okay now that we have computers. People are using planetary equations coupled with geometric integration techniques to yield integrators that are fast, accurate, stable, and conserve angular momentum and energy over long spans of time. (Normally, you can't have all of these. You're lucky if you get just two or three.) Another nice feature of these planetary equations is that they let you see features such as resonances that are otherwise obscured by the truly ""hot mess"" of the cartesian equations of motion.</p>

"How could a neutron star collapse into a black hole?","902","","<p>White dwarfs usually do not collapse, as they have electron degeneracy pressure due to the Pauli exclusion principle. However, if one accretes mass beyond the Chandrasekhar limit, it is energetically favorable for the electrons to combine with protons and form neutrons. This gives us a neutron star.</p>

<p>However, neutron stars usually do not collapse into black holes due to neutron degeneracy pressure. How is it possible that beyond the LOV limit, the Pauli exclusion principle no longer prevents the collapse? Shouldn't it still prevent neutrons, which are fermions, from being compressed together any further?</p>

<p>I've seen answers involving quark stars, but those are purely hypothetical. What is the most accepted explanation for this?</p>
","<p>The scenario you describe <em>may</em> occur. On the other hand it may actually be that neutronisation in a white dwarf is the trigger for a thermonuclear type Ia supernova.</p>

<p>You may be misunderstanding the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP).The PEP states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state, <strong>not</strong> that they cannot occupy the same space or be compressed to whatever density you like. The quantum states here consist of two spin states for every possible momentum state. In a degenerate gas, all these states are filled up to the Fermi energy. All that happens when the neutron star gets smaller (or collapses), is that the Fermi energy just keeps increasing as the neutron density climbs, and the neutron degeneracy pressure just keeps increasing as a consequence.</p>

<p>However, in General Relativity, pressure (like mass/energy) is a source of gravitational curvature and actually <em>increases</em> the required pressure gradient needed to support the star. At a certain threshold radius - a small factor larger than the Schwarzschild radius, a point of instability is reached where increasing the pressure is actually counter-productive.  Beyond this, you can make the pressure as large as you like and it will not prevent the formation of a black hole.</p>

<p>Even inside the BH there is not necessarily a problem with the PEP. You can compress fermions to infinite density so long as they can have infinite momentum.</p>

"How cold is interstellar space?","901","","<p>The vastness of space brings me a sense of chilliness even though I have never experienced it, although I wish to. <strong>Just how cold is interstellar space (on average)?</strong> How is this even measured? I mean you can't just stick a thermometer in space, right? </p>
","<p>You <em>can</em> stick a thermometer in space, and if it is a super-high-tech one, it might show you the temperature of the gas. But since the interstellar medium (ISM) is so dilute, a normal thermometer will radiate energy away faster than it can absorb it, and thus it won't reach thermal equilibrium with the gas.
It won't cool all the way to 0 K, though, since the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background"" rel=""noreferrer"">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> won't allow it to cool further than 2.7 K, as described by David Hammen.</p>

<p>The term ""temperature"" is a measure of the average energy of the particles of a gas (other definitions exist e.g. for a radiation field). If the gas is very thin, but particles move at the same average speed as, say, at the surface of Earth, the gas is still said to have a temperature of, say, 27º C, or $ 300\,\mathrm{K}$.</p>

<p>The ISM consists of several different phases, each with their own physical characteristics and origins. Arguably, the three most important phases are (see e.g. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0106359"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ferrière 2001</a>):</p>

<strong>Molecular clouds</strong>

<p>Stars are born in dense molecular clouds with temperatures of just 10-20 K. In order for a star to form, the gas must be able to collapse gravitationally, which is impossible if the atoms move too fast.</p>

<strong>The warm neutral medium</strong>

<p>The molecular clouds themselves form from gas that is neutral, i.e. not ionized. Since most of the gas is hydrogen, this means that it has a temperature of roughly $10^4\,\mathrm{K}$, above which hydrogen tends to get ionized.</p>

<strong>The hot ionized medium</strong>

<p>Gas that accretes onto the galaxy in its early phases tend to have much larger temperature, of roughly $10^6\,\mathrm{K}$. Additionally, the radiative feedback from the hot stars (O and B), and the kinetic and radiative energy injected by supernova explosions ionize and heat gas bubbles that expand. This gas comprises the hot ionized medium.</p>

<strong>Cooling</strong>

<p>The reason that the ISM is so sharply divided into phases, as opposed to just being a smooth mixture of particles of all sorts of energies, is that gas cools by various physical processes that have a rather temperature-specific efficiency.
""Cooling"" means converting the kinetic energy of particles into radiation that is able to leave the system.</p>

<em>Hot gas</em>

<p>Very hot gas is fully collisionally ionized and thus cools mainly through free electron emitting Bremsstrahlung. This mechanism becomes inefficent below $\sim10^6\,\mathrm{K}$.</p>

<em>Warm gas</em>

<p>Between $10^4\,\mathrm{K}$ and $10^6\,\mathrm{K}$, recombinations (i.e. electrons being caught by ions) and collisonal excitation and subsequent de-excitation lead to emission, removing energy from the system. 
Here the metallicity$^\dagger$ of the gas is important, since various elements have different energy levels.</p>

<em>Cool gas</em>

<p>At lower temperatures, the gas is almost fully neutral, so recombinations cease to have any influence. Collisions between hydrogen atom become too weak to excite the atoms, but if molecules or metals are present, it is possible through fine/hyperfine lines, and rotational/vibrational lines, respectively.</p>

<p>The total cooling is the sum of all these processes, but will be dominated by one or a few processes at a given temperature. The figures below from <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJS...88..253S"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sutherland &amp; Dopita (1993)</a> shows the main cooling processes (left) and the main cooling elements (<em>right</em>), as a function of temperature:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zlt2p.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zlt2p.png"" alt=""processes/elements""></a></p>

<p>The thick line show the total cooling rate. The figure below, from the same paper, shows the total cooling rate for different metallicities. The metallicity is a logarithmic scale, so [Fe/H] = 0 means Solar metallicity, and [Fe/H] = –1 means 0.1 times Solar metallicity, while ""nil"" is zero metallicity.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2Zc1.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2Zc1.png"" alt=""total""></a></p>

<p>Since these processes don't cover equally the full temperature range, the gas will tend to reach certain ""plateaus"" in temperatures, i.e. it will tend to occupy certain specific temperatures. When gas cools, it contracts. From the ideal gas law, we know that the pressure $P$ is proportional to the product of the density $n$ and the temperature $T$. If there's pressure equilibrium in the ISM (which there isn't always, but in many cases is a good assumption), then $nT$ is constant, and thus if a parcel of hot ionized gas cools from $10^7\,\mathrm{K}$ to $10^4\,\mathrm{K}$, it must contract to increases its density by a factor $10^3$. Thus, cooler clouds are smaller and denser, and in this way the ISM is divided up in its various phases.</p>

<p>So, to conclude, interstellar space is not as cold as you may think. However, being extremely dilute, it is difficult to <em>transfer</em> heat, so if you leave your spaceship, you will radiate away energy faster than you can absorb it from the gas.</p>

<p>Stellar bodies get tidally locked with time. You even get <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/12541/tidal-lock-radius-in-habitable-zones"">graphs like there</a>.</p>

<p>$$t_{\text{lock}} \approx \frac{\omega a^6 I Q}{3 G m_p^2 k_2 R^5} $$</p>

<p>Where $Q$ and $k_2$ depend on the constituents and age of the satellite, which themselves evolve with time. Difficult to estimate. Moreover, you rarely know the age of your system.</p>

<p>But it explains that for long-time established system of relatively close bodies, tidal lock is generally the case. The more tide there is, the quicker it gets.</p>

"How do we know dark matter/dark energy exists?","899","","<p>I've never quite understood the theory behind why dark matter and dark energy exist. I know it has something to do with gravitational pull being stronger than what we calculate it SHOULD be, could someone explain this in more detail?</p>
","<p>Some additions to the answer of MBR:</p>

<p>In fact, we do not know that dark matter and dark energy do exist, but we have indirect clues. You will often see claims that dark matter and dark energy are two of the major problems of cosmology today, including by professional astronomers, but this is an epistemological misconception: you cannot call a hypothesis <em>a problem</em>. </p>

<p>Currently we have several observational anomalies (as defined per T. Kuhn): namely the rotation curve of galaxies, the luminosity of supernovae, the power spectrum of the CMB... (and some additional things like the difficulty to measure G or to detect directly gravitational waves).</p>

<p>According to the history of science, we have 3 ways to solve these anomalies:</p>

<ul>
<li>ontological approaches (dark matter and dark energy)</li>
<li>legislatives approaches (extensions of General Relativity)</li>
<li>paradigmatic approaches (inhomogeneous Universes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Dark matter and dark energy are two ontological approaches that seems to work pretty well: by adding two simple components we can fit a wide range of observations. This is why astronomers like them: their modelization are relatively easy and allow to fit everything well. But for the moment we do not know their nature. </p>

<p>Some say that with <a href=""http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/"">WMAP</a> (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) and <a href=""http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Planck"">Planck space observatory</a> we have entered in the era of precision cosmology: but this is only true if our paradigm of dark matter/dark energy approaches is correct. If this is not the case, we currently do not interpret correctly what we measure, but ultimately more accurate measures can lead to a better view of current cosmological anomalies.</p>

<p>So dark matter and dark energy are two elegant and minimalist approaches to several fundamental problems. This is a very hot topic in cosmology, but we may realize, one day, that we only had problems because our current paradigm was erroneous.</p>

With temperatures of 10 million degrees or more"". </p>

<p>How are these diffused (ionized) gas able to become so hot when they are in large distances from one another and have very little density? </p>
","<p>What that ESA (European Space Agency) page titled <a href=""http://spaceinimages.esa.int/Images/2013/11/Hot_gas_sloshing_in_a_galactic_cauldron"">Hot gas sloshing in a galactic cauldron</a> that you link to describes are called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm%E2%80%93hot_intergalactic_medium"">WHIM</a> (Warm–Hot Intergalactic Medium). They are not interstellar medium, but intergalactic medium gas. The difference in density is huge, with interstellar medium density at an average of $\rho ∼ 1\ ppcm$ (one proton per cubic centimeter), but the density of these WHIM being even a few orders of magnitude lower at $\rho ∼ 10^{−6}−10^{−5}\ ppcm$, or roughly 1 to 10 protons per cubic meter (<a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/10-048.html"">NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> quotes average density of 6 protons per cubic meter).</p>

<p>What is interesting about WHIM is that they are absolutely huge. We're talking of distances that extend across clusters of galaxies (so stretching multiple millions of light years), which means that even as tenuous as they are, account for a large portion of the baryonic matter of the Universe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Such matter is predicted to account for a sizable fraction ($∼ 50\%$)
  of all the baryons in the local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ($z &lt; 1$ <code>[redshift in the infrared
  spectrum]</code>) Universe, and it is thus considered the best candidate to
  host the baryons seen at high redshift and missing from the low
  redshift census.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now about their heat emissions, and why are they detected in the X-ray range in the first place (the ESA's article mentions the photograph featured there was taken by the ESA’s XMM-Newton X-ray observatory):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Electrons and baryons in the WHIM are shock-heated during their infall
  in the dark matter LSS <code>[Large–Scale Structures]</code> potential well, and settle in
  filamentary/sheet-like structures surrounding LSSs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've added a few clarifications in quotes encapsulated in square brackets, but what this means is that parts of these WHIM interact with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus"">AGN</a> (Active Galactic Nucleus) as the galaxies pass by, and the X-ray emissions of AGN excite <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon"">Baryonic matter</a> to a temperature $T ∼ 10^5−10^7 K$.</p>

<p>In addition, ideally I would also like to have a formula that determines the percentage of sunlight at each minute past sunset. For example, after 15 minutes, there is only 50% sunlight left. </p>
","<p>One may define three forms of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight"" rel=""noreferrer"">twilight</a> on Earth.  Although the actual amount of light depends on weather, topography, and land cover, they are defined as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Civil twilight: Solar angle > -6°</li>
<li>Nautical twilight: Solar angle > -12°</li>
<li>Astronomical twilight: Solar angle > -18°</li>
</ul>

<p>Human eyes see logarithmically so % of sunlight left is not a very useful measure, unless you are interested in incoming shortwave radiation for solar panel or other energy calculations.</p>

<p>To answer your question, you need to calculate at what time the Sun will be at those elevations below the horizon; this is calculated in a similar fashion to sunrise and sunset times.  However, on top of that you also need to consider atmospheric refraction.  See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_of_the_Sun"" rel=""noreferrer"">position of the Sun</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_equation"" rel=""noreferrer"">sunrise equation</a>.

"How much would you weigh if Earth stopped orbiting the Sun?","897","","<p>I have a curious question.</p>

<p>The reason why astronauts are weightless in space is because they are orbiting Earth. If they suddenly stopped orbiting they would fall directly into Earth. Earth is doing the same around the Sun, so it would fall directly into the Sun if the Earth stopped orbiting the Sun.</p>

<p>If the Earth stopped rotating and orbiting, obviously ignoring the adverse effects of doing this and having Earth hold it's current position in it's orbit, how much would a 150 pound person weigh if they stood on suitable position on Earth.</p>

<p>This question is kinda out there, but it's a thought-provoking question for me and hopefully others.</p>
","<p>In a sense, this is one of those ""If I break the laws of physics, what do the laws of physics say will happen"" kinds of questions.</p>

<p>Ignoring that, a 150 pound person would still weigh about 150 pounds if the Earth miraculously stopped orbiting the Sun. Almost all of a person's weight results from resistance to the Earth's gravity field. The tidal gravitational forces from the Moon and Sun are on the order of 10<sup>-4</sup> ounces of force.</p>

<p>Note: I'm answering the question from the perspective of ""what would a bathroom scale say"". A doctor's scale would say a 150 pound person weighs 150 pounds regardless of whether the person is standing on the Moon, the Earth, or a very massive planet. A doctor's scale measures mass. A bathroom scale measures apparent weight. </p>

<p>So what <em>would</em> a bathroom scale say? If the Earth is at one astronomical unit from the Sun, whether the Earth is orbiting at 30 km/s or falling straight toward the Sun doesn't matter one iota. All that matters is that the Earth is one AU from the Sun. In both cases, that the Sun is 1 AU distant makes a 150 pound person weigh about $1.8 \times 10^-4$ ounces less at noon or at midnight than at sunrise or sunset.</p>

<p>The difference between the orbiting Earth and the in-falling Earth is that these tidal forces are more or less constant in the case of the orbiting Earth. They grow ever larger in the case of the in-falling Earth as it gets closer and closer to the Sun.</p>

<p>These tidal forces become quite large by the time the surface of the Earth just touches the surface of the Sun. Now our 150 pound person would weigh only 73.5 pounds per a bathroom scale if he was standing at that point where the surface of the Earth just touches the Sun. He would also weigh about the same at the point on the Earth furthest from the Sun. He would however weigh considerably more, about 188 pounds, if he happens to be at a point where the Sun is on the horizon.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, some mysterious, magical force makes the Earth stop orbiting the Sun and makes this change permanent (i.e., the Earth stops moving with respect to the Sun), a 150 pound person closest to the Sun would weigh about 1.4 ounces less, while a 150 pound person furthest from the Sun would weigh about 1.4 ounces more. A 150 pound person who sees the Sun at the horizon would still weigh about 150 pounds in this scenario.</p>

"What physical features determine if a planet is a major, minor or dwarf planet?","897","","<p>Like many, when I was growing up, we always were taught, hence always learned that there were 9 planets.  However, recently, decisions were made and all of a sudden there were 8 major planets and a series of dwarf and minor planets.  </p>

<p>What physical features delineate a body being referred to as a <strong>major planet</strong> as opposed to <strong>dwarf planet</strong> or <strong>minor planet</strong>?</p>
","<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet#Physical_characteristics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Planets</a></strong></p>

<p>For a body to be classified as a planet it must have a few physical characteristics:</p>

<p><strong>Mass</strong></p>

<p>It must have enough mass to have a strong enough gravity to overcome electrostatic forces to bring it to a state of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hydrostatic equilibrium</a>. </p>

<p><em>Hydrostatic equilibrium is important because early in a planets life it is nearly entirely fluid, crust and all</em></p>

<p><strong>Internal Differentiation</strong></p>

<p>The life cycle of a planet essentially leads to denser heavier metals being at the centre of a planet, surrounded by a mantle which must at some point have been fluid (it can still be solid and called a planet as long as it <em>used</em> to be fluid.)</p>

<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong> </p>

<p>This is usually driven by its mass but a planet should have an atmosphere. This means it should be massive enough to have a strong enough gravity to hold some gasses to its surface. </p>

<p>More massive planets are capable of keeping lighter gasses, such as hydrogen, bound to them too. I.e Jupiter. </p>

<p><strong>Magnetosphere</strong></p>

<p>A magnetosphere suggests that the body is still geologically active. This means they have flows of elements that conduct electricity in their interiors. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">As specified by the IAU</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_planet#Physical_properties_of_comets_and_minor_planets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Minor Planets</a></strong></p>

<p>Minor planets  are things such as asteroids, they are usually small mass, rocky bodies. This is different from small mass bodies that might be predominantly ice or water. </p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Planet#Characteristics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dwarf Planets</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Size and Mass</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IAU</a> have not specified an upper or lower limit for mass to be considered a Dwarf Planet, therefore it is predominantly determined by one other feature called:</p>

<p><strong>Orbital Dominance</strong></p>

<p>Orbital dominance is achieved when a body has cleared it's orbit of all other bodies.</p>

<p>For example planets are able to remove small bodies out of their area through impact, capture, or gravitational disturbance. </p>

<p>Any body that is incapable of doing so is therefore classified as a dwarf planet. So if Jupiter was incapable of clearing its neighbourhood of bodies then it too would be a Dwarf planet.</p>

An object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period (one sidereal day), and thus appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers.</p>

<p>My question is then couldn't any orbit be a GEO? I mean, what about a satellite in an orbit that's say 70,000km, if the angular speed of the satellite was the same as the earth's rotation such that it always stayed in a fixed position when observed from the Earth, then isn't that a GEO orbit as well?</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force"" rel=""noreferrer"">centrifugal force</a> increases with the radius of the orbit for a fixed angular speed.

<p>It would seem that supermassive black holes only exert gravity towards themselves. </p>
","<p>When it comes to accretion disks, nothing is coming <em>out</em> of the black hole. That's just orbiting matter, though it is swirled around a bit by frame dragging.

As time passes, we will receive CMB from a shell with an increasingly larger radius. As that light has traveled farther through space, it will, as you say, be more redshifted, or ""cooler"".

<p>Assuming an isotropic Universe, if the smallest observable parcels of gas were 19 kpc across <em>perpendicular</em> to our line of sight, they are also on average 19 kpc across <em>along</em> our line of sight.</p>

<p>So the question of how fast the CMB changes comes down to how much time did it take light to travel 19 kpc when the Universe was 379,000 years old. This is not simply 19 kpc divided by the speed of light, since the Universe expands as the light travels, but it's pretty close. If my calculations are not wrong, we will have to wait until the CMB has been redshifted roughly to 1200, which will take around <strong>60,000 years</strong> (assuming that Planck will not get replaced by better instruments within that time which, um, is dubious).</p>

<p><strong>So you're right, you could make a 3D image of the CMB, but since the patterns are much larger than a lightyear, you don't have to take a new picture every year.</strong></p>

<p>Actually, I'm a bit surprised by these small numbers of 19 kpc and 60 kyr. If somebody can spot a mistake here (e.g. a missing (1+z) factor), please correct. My calculations are here (in Python):</p>

"What is the shape of the Sun's orbit around the Earth taking into account elliptical orbits?","868","","<p>Consider the non-inertial frame that is at rest with respect to the Earth's revolution around the Sun.  (Ignore the Earth's rotation around its own axis.)  My question is, what is the shape of the Sun's orbit around the Earth in this reference frame?</p>

<p>Now if we assume the Earth moves in a circular orbit around the Sun, then the Sun's orbit around the Earth will also be circular.

Specifically it's the great circle formed by the intersection of the ecliptic plane with the celestial sphere.</p>

<p>But the Earth does not move in a circular orbit - Kepler's first law states that the Earth moves in an ellipse around the Sun, with the Sun at one of the foci of the ellipse.  So if we consider the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun, what is the shape of the Sun's orbit around the Earth.  I doubt it's an ellipse, so would be it a more complicated-looking curve.</p>

"What does the velocity dispersion of a galaxy mean?","862","","<p>Also, what is the advantage of getting information about the velocity dispersion of a galaxy?</p>
","<strong>Definition of the velocity dispersion</strong>

<p>From the title of your question, I'm unsure whether you actually know what ""dispersion"" means: The dispersion of some numbers is the spread around their mean, usually taken to mean their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">standard deviation</a>. If you measure the velocity of several light sources (from the Doppler shift of their spectral lines) that are gravitationally bound, they will have some average velocity$^\dagger$. But since the light sources — which could be stars or gas clouds — move around each other, some move a little faster, and some move a little slower. This will cause their combined emission line to be broadened, instead of being a very narrow line. The central area of this line that emcompasses roughly 68% of the area of the line has a certain width. If the distribution is Gaussian (which is typically the case), then this width, divided by two, is the standard deviation. This is the usual definition, I think, but note that other definitions could be used, e.g. the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_width_at_half_maximum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">full width at half maximum</a> which differs from the standard deviation by a constant factor of $2\sqrt{2\ln2}$ for a Gaussian.</p>

<strong>A relation between the mass, size, and velocity dispersion</strong>

<p>The velocity dispersion $\sigma_V$ of gravitationally interacting ""particles"" such as stars in a galaxy, or galaxies in a cluster, provides a measure of the total mass and its distribution. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virial_theorem#In_astrophysics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">virial theorem</a>, which describes the total energy of a bound system, can be expressed to show that the components of a galaxy of mass $M$ and radius $R$ will have characteristic velocities of the order of the velocity dispersion
$$
\sigma_V = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{CR}},
$$
where $G$ is the gravitational constant, and the observationally determined factor $C$ depends on the geometry and the actual mass distribution, as well as on whether the system is rotation-dominated (such as disk galaxies) or dispersion-dominated (such as elliptical galaxies) (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008gady.book.....B"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Binney &amp; Tremaine 2008</a>). For dispersion-dominated galaxies, $M$ refers to the total, dynamical mass of the system, and $C \simeq 6.7$ for various galactic mass distributions (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...706.1364F"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Förster Schreiber et al. 2009</a>). For rotation-dominated galaxies, the appropriate mass is the mass enclosed within $R$, and $C \simeq 2.25$, again averaged over various galactic mass distribution models (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A&amp;A...504..789E"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Epinat et al. 2009</a>).</p>

<p>The velocity dispersion is rather easy to determine with spectroscopy, since it broadens the spectral lines (other processes also broaden the lines, so one must be careful to disentangle different effects). With photometry, the size of the galaxy can be determined (note though that the size can differ when observed in different bands). Thus, even if you don't know whether a galaxy is rotation- or dispersion-dominated, a moderately precise measure of its mass — one of the main characteristics of a galaxy — can be obtained (e.g. setting $C=5$ won't be too far off, and in astronomy we're usually happy with such small errors).</p>

<strong>Other relations</strong>

<p>Because of various scaling relations, $\sigma_V$ can also be used to probe other quantities, or other quantities can be used to probe $\sigma_V$. For instance, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%E2%80%93sigma_relation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">M-sigma relation</a> relates the mass $M_\mathrm{BH}$ of a galaxy's central, supermassive black hole to $\sigma_V$ (through $M_\mathrm{BH} \propto \sigma_V^4$, roughly), and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faber%E2%80%93Jackson_relation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Faber–Jackson relation</a> relates the luminosity $L$ of a galaxy to $\sigma_V$ (through $L\propto\sigma_V^4$, more roughly).</p>

<p>And hence ..</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Indeed, is the arm-pattern catching us and moving through us ... or is the arm pattern slower than us and we're moving through it?</strong></li>
</ol>
","<p>The answer to the question depends on precisely where you are in the Milky Way. According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_wave_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">density wave theory</a>, which appears to describe the formation and evolution of spiral arms quite well, the arms move relative to some static inertial frame at a global pattern speed $\Omega_{gp}$. At some defining radius $R_c$, known as the corotation radius, stars move at $\Omega_{gp}$. Inside $R_c$, stars move quicker and thus move ahead of the arms; outside $R_c$, stars move slower and thus ""fall behind"" the arms.</p>

<p>There is uncertainty surrounding the values of $R_c$ and $\Omega_{gp}$ in the Milky Way in all its spiral arms - especially since local stellar kinematics differ in each of the arms, and so too may $R_c$ and $\Omega_{gp}$ - but measurements place the Solar System slightly inside the corotation radius, meaning that we are moving ahead of the arms.</p>

<p>I have data from a review by <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MSAIS..18..185G"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gerhard (2011)</a>. Here are some basic average parameters, for the Milky Way as a whole:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Bar</em> corotation radius ($R_{CR}$): $3.5$-$4.5\text{ kpc}$</li>
<li>Spiral arm corotation radius: $8.1$-$8.4\text{ kpc}$</li>
<li>Bar pattern speed ($\Omega_b$): $50$-$60\text{ km}\text{ s}^{-1}\text{ kpc}^{-1}$</li>
<li>Spiral arm pattern speed ($\Omega_{sp}$): $17$-$28\text{ km}\text{ s}^{-1}\text{ kpc}^{-1}$</li>
</ul>

<p>This also goes along with a local mean speed of stars in the solar neighborhood - the Sun included - of $\sim220\text{ km}\text{ s}^{-1}$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Hence for the three questions: (1) The pattern is rotating clockwise as seen in that diagram; (2) It rotates about once every 300 million years; (3) and at our radius, we're moving a little faster than the pattern so we are overtaking it.</p>

<p>The excerpt above was an argument made by Stephen Hawking, explaining that a white hole and a black hole are essentially the same object.

"What causes objects to become tidally locked?","844","","<p>I'm trying to write a gravity simulation (suns planets etc), and was hoping tidal locking could be one feature demonstrated.</p>

<p>Using a simple equation for gravity has produced some interesting results, but (unless its emergent behaviour) I see nothing that would encourage tidal locking. But, after some reading it appears tidal locking is quite common, planets and their satellites, planets and suns, suns and other suns (binary stars).</p>

<p>Is it a result of the formation stage of these objects, or is it somehow a function of the equation of gravity?</p>
","<p>Tidal locking occurs because the planet deforms the satellite into an oval, with long axis pointing towards the planet. If the satellite is rotating the long axis will move away from being pointing towards the planet, and the gravity of the planet will tend to pull it back, slowing the rotation until one face is permanently facing the planet. Tidal locking isn't a result of the formation processes, but a consequence of satellites not being perfectly rigid.</p>

<p>In order to model the effects of tides on the orbits and rotation periods of satellites you need to know several important pieces of information.</p>

<p>First you obviously need to know the size of the planet and the satellite (both in terms of mass and radius) the shape of the orbit and the rotation rate of both planet and satellite. For many objects, these values are well known.</p>

<p>Next, and this is the tricky bit, you need to know how the satellite and planet will be deformed by the other's gravity, and how much tidal heating will occur. These are the so-called ""love number"" (after Augustus Love) and the dissipation function, Q. </p>

<p>It is hard to estimate these. For the Earth Moon system the ratio k/Q is known to be 0.0011. (but the Earth is a poor model for other planets, which don't have a substantial ocean, or a liquid core) </p>

<p>For other planets <a href=""http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/EART_206/09-0127/Goldreich%20&amp;%20Soter%2066%20Icarus%205-375.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">the value of Q varies between 10 and 10000</a>, with larger values for the gas giants, and k can be estimated from the rigidity of the bodies. </p>

<p>A simple gravitation model is not able to capture the subtleties of the gravitational interaction between two mutually deforming bodies, indeed for most simulations, the planets are modelled as points, or at most as spheres, and this is good enough for all but the highest precision calculations.</p>

<p>Tidal locking takes a long time (by human standards) but a relatively short time compared with the age of the solar system. The time taken is very strongly dependent (order 6) on the radius of the orbit.</p>

<p>Direct simulation would be more or less impossible: the deformations are too small, and the time scale of locking is too large. It would be possible (though difficult) to model tidal locking in a simulation with unrealistic values for the rigidity of the satellite, and the size of the planet (think jelly world, orbiting a (Newtonian) black hole) so the deformation is greater and the locking time shorter. However modelling the  elastic deformation of a body under gravity is far from trivial. </p>

","<p>The apparent magnitude (in V ~ visual) is in column 42-46. Other magnitudes are BT magnitude (columns 218-223) and VT magnitude (columns 231-236). These are magnitudes recorded with different (colour) filters. 
The colour ($B-V$) can be found in columns 246-251, expressed in magnitudes. This is the difference between V (visual) magnitude and B (blue) magnitude also known as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_index"">colour index</a>. Blue stars have a low colour index ($B-V&lt;0$) as the star will be brighter in the blue (B) passband (filter), and will therefore have a low B magnitude, while red stars will have a higher $B-V$ colour index.</p>

<p>Mass, Radius, and Temperature are not in the catalogue. Mass can only be directly determined for multiple star systems and requires a lot of observations per multiple star. Radius is determined from stellar models. And Temperature can be determined from the spectrum of the star. A crude indication can be gotten from the colour index of the star. (see for instance this <a href=""https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdeedu/kstars/ai-colorandtemp.html"">webpage</a>).</p>

<p>Finally the type can be found in the star's spectral type. The spectral type is in columns 436-447. These spectral types are not always easy to read but they consist of a spectral class (e.g. O, or F type stars) and the luminosity class (and some other information). The luminosity class gives the type of class in roman numerals.

<p>The apparent visual is(V) magnitude $-0.05$. The colour index is $B-V = 1.239$, which means that it is probably a red K type star with temperature $T\approx 4000 \textrm{K}$ (<a href=""https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdeedu/kstars/ai-colorandtemp.html"">from figure 2 on this webpage</a>). The spectral type is K2IIIp, i.e. the spectral class is K2 and the luminosity class is III, a normal giant star.</p>

<p>An indication for the Radius can be found from the Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram in which radii are added (see <a href=""http://astro.wsu.edu/worthey/astro/html/im-Galaxy/hr-radii.gif"">Figure here</a>). The luminosity of Arcturus can be calculated as follows:
$$ d = \frac{1}{\varpi}$$
where $d$ is in parsec and $\varpi$ is the parallax in arsceconds. The parallax is in columns 80-86 and is $\varpi = 88.85mas = 0.08885^{\prime\prime}$ for Arcturus. The distance is, therefore, $d=11.25\textrm{pc}$. You can then calculate the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude"">absolute magnitude ($M_V$):</a>
$$ M_V = m_V -5(\log{d}-1)$$
where $m_V$ is the apparent visual (V) magnitude. The absolute magnitude of Arcturus is: $M_V=-0.05 - 5(\log{11.25}-1)=-0.31$.
The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)"">luminosity</a> is then given by:
$$M-M_{\textrm{sun}} = -2.5\log{\left( \frac{L}{L_{\textrm{sun}}}\right)}$$
where the absolute magnitude of the Sun is $M_{\textrm{sun}} = 4.83$ and $L$ is the luminosity of Arcturus. This gives:

"Tidal influences of planets on the sun","840","","<p>How big are the tidal influences of planets (say, Jupiter) on the sun? Do they lead to any measurable effects, for example, do they influence the sunspots, or are they observable in any other way?</p>
","<p>The basic tidal acceleration felt by a test mass near the surface of the Sun, due to a body of mass $m$ at a distance $r$ is given by
$$a_{\rm tidal} = 2\frac{Gm R}{r^3},$$
where $R$ is the radius of the Sun.</p>

<p>You can work out that Jupiter has the largest tidal effect on the Sun, <em>very closely followed</em> by Venus, and both produce tidal forces that are only a factor of $\sim 2.2$ times greater than that produced by the Earth on the Sun.</p>

<p>The distortion of the Sun could be modelled as following the consequent equipotentials (well inside the Roche lobe) in a binary system, but this is not analytically solvable and I could not locate any straightforward approximations. One way to judge the size of the effect would be to compare the tidal acceleration with the centrifugal acceleration at the Sun's surface $R\omega_{\rm Sun}^2$.</p>

<p>So $a_{\rm tidal}$ for Jupiter is $3.7\times10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$, whereas the centrifugal acceleration (at the solar equator) is 7 orders of magnitude larger at 0.006 m/s$^2$. Given that the Sun is <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/208344/why-is-the-sun-almost-perfectly-spherical/208348#208348"">almost spherical</a> to 1 part in 100,000, because the centrifugal acceleration is only 20 millionths of the Sun's surface gravity, we can safely assume that tides due to planets that are 7 orders of magnitude weaker do not distort the shape of the Sun to any degree worth worrying about.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find that the potential influence of planetary tides on solar activity is still an area of recent research. Suggestions that planetary tides might be responsible for sunspots or the sunspot cycle on the Sun go back a long way. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996Ap%26SS.243..393G"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grandpierre (1996)</a> suggested that planetary tides influence flows in the Sun and could be responsible for the 11-year solar cycle. A NASA report by <a href=""http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20070025111"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hung (2007)</a>, although not peer-reviewed, does suggest a link between solar activity and planetary positions. The claim is made that major solar flares happen ""underneath"" the locations of the major tide-inducing planets (Jupiter, Venus, Earth, Mercury [in that order]). </p>

<p>I very quickly found a peer-reviewed paper in ""Solar Physics"" by <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-013-0288-6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Seker (2013)</a>, which discusses all this and reviews the evidence on sunspots. They conclude that the appearance of new sunspots is <em>not</em> correlated at all with the positions of the planets. However, they do raise the caveat that because the magnetic fields producing the spots are produced at the tachocline between the radiative core and convective envelope of the Sun and take several days to buoyantly rise. Thus the longitude at which the spots appear and where they are generated, with respect to the positions of the planets, can change significantly.</p>

<p>I guess the jury is still out, but this is quite ""fringe"" material. The solar cycle is certainly thought to be a product of the dynamo mechanism that produces the magnetic field. However, the location of sunspots definitely cannot be predicted with such models at the moment. Interest in this topic has been revived recently by claims of correlations between magnetic activity and the orbital positions of hot Jupiter-type exoplanets and even the suggestion that tidal effects or interactions between stellar and planetary magnetic fields might be responsible for increased magnetic activity (see <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6049"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lanza 2014 for a recent review</a>). For these close-in exoplanets of course the tides are many orders of magnitude larger than in the solar system (see equation above).</p>

"Stellar mass of galaxies","836","","<p>Given the magnitudes (in the i-band) of certain galaxies, I would like to calculate their <strong>stellar mass (in terms of solar masses)</strong>. So far, I have calculated their absolute magnitudes and gotten to working out the mass-light ratio $M/L$ for each galaxy.</p>

<p>e.g. $M/L=0.563$</p>

<p>Values I have are the calculated $M/L$ for each galaxy, and the $i$-band apparent ($13.25$) and absolute ($-18.06$) magnitudes for the galaxy, as well as the distance ($18.44Mpc$).</p>

<p>From this I need to get the mass of the galaxy $M$ in terms of solar masses. Therefore I assume I first need to calculate the i-band luminosity for the galaxy in solar masses $L_i$. This is where I am stuck. </p>

<p>However, once I have $L_i$  next step would be ...
$$M_g = 0.563 * L_i$$</p>

<p>Ultimately, given these values, how would I go about estimating the stellar mass of a galaxy in terms of solar masses?</p>
","<p>The relation between <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude"" rel=""nofollow"">absolute magnitude</a> $M$ and luminosity $L$ for stars
$$\frac{L_{Star}}{L_{Sun}}=10^{(M_{Sun}-M_{Star})/2.5}$$
should also be appliable to i-band luminosities of galaxies.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ucolick.org/~cnaw/sun.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Taking the absolute magnitude 4.08 of the sun on the I-band</a> the luminosity of a galaxy with absolute magnitude −18.06 would be
$$\frac{L_{Galaxy}}{L_{Sun}}=10^{(4.08−(-18.06))/2.5}=0.7178\cdot 10^9.$$
An order of magnitude estimate for the mass of the galaxy would be
$0.563\cdot 0.7178\cdot 10^9=0.404\cdot 10^9$ solar masses.</p>

<p>But $M/L$ isn't necessarily biased the same way for the sun to $M_i/L_i$ as for the galaxy.
Therefore you'll probably need to compare the spectrum of the sun with the spectrum of the galaxy to find out the ratios of the i-band fraction of the total emission. Absorption and extinction at different wavelength may be different, therefore determining kind of mean temperature of stars in the galaxy could help finding a more realistic estimate for the stellar mass.</p>

"How far apart can two people watch the moon simultaneously?","835","","<p>Obviously there's a limited part of earths surface where the moon is visible at any given time. I imagine the area of this surface would be a lot smaller than the area where the sun is visible at any given time, due to the fact that the moon is a lot closer to earth. But how big is that area exactly?</p>

<p>Or, to put it differently: Imagine you are standing outside your house and looking at the moon. At the exact same moment someone else does the same in another location. But how far apart can you (theoretically) be?</p>
","<p>If we take 6371.0 km as the mean radius of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"" rel=""nofollow"">Earth</a>, an apogee of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"" rel=""nofollow"">Moon</a> of 405503 km, and a perigee of 363295 km, we get ratios of 6371.0 km / 405503 km = 0.01571 = sin 0.9002° resp. 6371.0 km / 363295 km = 0.01754 = sin 1.005°. So on both sides of Earth between $$40030\mbox{ km}\cdot 0.9002°/360°=100\mbox{ km}$$ and $$40030\mbox{ km}\cdot 1.005°/360° =112\mbox{ km},$$ with an average circumference of $2\pi\cdot 6371\mbox{ km}=40030\mbox{ km},~$ get lost of the 20015 km of the half circumference of Earth as zone of visibility.</p>

<p>The calculation is simplified to the simultaneous visibility of a point at the distance of the center of moon. More precisely one part of the moon can be visible from one observer, while an other part of the moon is visible from a second observer. This adds between 29.3 and 34.1 arc minutes or between 54.3 (apogee) and 63.2 km (perigee) to the diameter of the zone of visibility.</p>

<p>The visibility of the Moon is influenced by additional factors like air temperature, height of the observer above sea level or the geographic position by Earth's flattening. But this applies also for the visibility of the sun.</p>

<p>The corresponding calculations for the sun: With aphelion of Earth of 152098232 km and perihelion of 147098290 km, we get ratios of 6371.0 km / 152098232 km = 0.000041887 = sin 0.0024000° resp. 6371.0 km / 147098290 km = 0.000043311 = sin 0.0024815°.
So on both sides of Earth between $$40030\mbox{ km}\cdot 0.0024000°/360°=0.26686\mbox{ km}=266.86\mbox{ m}$$
and
$$40030\mbox{ km}\cdot 0.0024815/360°=0.27780\mbox{ km}=277.80\mbox{ m}$$
get lost of the 20015 km of the half circumference of Earth as zone of visibility.</p>

<p>(For a rough estimate you may take the 100 km loss of the moon visibility, and multiply it by the quotient of the distances Earth-Moon and Earth-Sun roughly equal to 400,000 km / 150,000,000 km = 0.002667, to get 266.7 m visibility loss of the sun.)</p>

<p>This is again simplified, and applies to the center of the sun. The appearent diameter of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"" rel=""nofollow"">sun</a> varies between 31.6 and 32.7 arc minutes, adding between 58.6 (aphelion) and 60.6 km (perihelion) to the diameter of the zone of visibility for observers looking at different parts of the sun.</p>

<p>Depending on which scenarios to be compared, the lost area varies. As an example, a loss of a radius of the visible zone of the moon in comparison to the sun of 100 km corresponds to a roughly cylindrical area of $$100\mbox{ km}\cdot \pi\cdot 40030\mbox{ km}=12.6 \mbox{ million square kilometers}.$$</p>

<p>How far can two observers be apart at maximum, to see two differnt parts of the moon at the same time? $$20015 \mbox{ km} - 2\cdot 100 \mbox{ km} + 54.3 \mbox{ km} = 19869.3 \mbox{ km}$$ (apogee) for the average Earth radius. For the same part of the moon it's $$20015 \mbox{ km} - 2\cdot 100 \mbox{ km} = 19815\mbox{ km}.$$</p>

(for example the neighborhood of radius 50 light-years). </p>

<p><em>Remark:</em> The mass of the observable matter should be completed by the mass of the ""dark matter"".</p>
","<p>You don't have to guesstimate to come up with the answer.</p>

<p>What you do is look at the dynamics of stars with respect to the Galactic plane - in particular, the velocity dispersions of stars with known distances from the plane, combined with a reasonable assessment of where the Sun is with respect to the plane (close), yields an almost model-independent assessment of the mass density in the disk of our Galaxy in the vicinity of the Sun.</p>

<p>This work was done using the Hipparcos cataogue by <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998A%26A...329..920C"" rel=""nofollow"">Creze et al. (1998)</a>. They found that the local mass-density (all forms of matter) in the Galactic disk was $0.076 \pm 0.015 M_{\odot}/pc^3$.</p>

<p>Thus within 50 light years (15.3 pc), because the Galactic disk has an exponential scale height much bigger than this (about 100-200 pc), we can assume a constant density and derive a total mass in the solar neighborhood of $1100\pm 200\ M_{\odot}$.</p>

<p>This mass is almost compatible with the total mass estimated to be in stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, brown dwarfs and the interstellar medium gas. For instance, according to <a href=""http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2001ASPC..228..249C/0000252.000.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Chabrier (2001)</a>, the total mass density is almost accounted for in the form of 60% main sequence stars plus white dwarfs and neutrons stars, about 5% brown dwarfs and 30% gas, and so <strong>the contribution of dark matter to the local disk density is probably very small</strong>. Dark matter is not distributed in the same way as normal matter; it did not collapse to a disk, because it is dissipationless and probably exists in a spherical halo. <strong>So this consistency between the local baryonic matter density and the total mass density is not an argument against the dark matter hypothesis</strong>. </p>

<p>EDIT: I found a few estimates of the local dark matter density that use the kinematics of local stars as a constraint.

<p>Similar question: <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/1812/if-venus-and-mars-changed-places-would-we-then-have-3-habitable-planets"">If Venus and Mars changed places, would we then have 3 habitable planets?</a></p>
","<p>KarenRei's answer is very good as there is a significant degree of uncertainty, that said, I think the answer to this question is a clear no, the Earth would not be habitable at Venus' distance to the Sun.  Not unless you're a waterbear living in a very deep cave.</p>

<p>Venus' average distance to the sun is .722 AU.   <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/15462/how-far-are-the-planets-from-the-sun/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>.  That means the surface of the sun is about 38.5% closer (A bit more than that since distance is measured to the center of the sun, not the surface) and because illumination drops by the square of the distance, Venus gets hit by 92% more solar energy per square meter than the Earth does.</p>

<p>It's thought that life on the Earth's surface could get difficult with just a small percent luminosity increase from the sun in as little as 150 million years or so and with a 10%-15% luminosity increase range (1 to 1.5 billion years), Earth could begin to have surface water vaporization, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect.    <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/01/earth-wont-die-soon-thought"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>.   Some estimates say even sooner, 600-700 million years, or a 6-7% increase in luminosity.   </p>

<p>These estimates are difficult to model and should be taken with a grain of salt, but if a 15% increase begins vaporizing lakes on land, and with water being a greenhouse gas, a 92% increase would be catastrophic, almost certainly leading to a very hot, Venus like surface temperature on Earth with a significant increase in atmospheric water vapor and perhaps Methane trapped below frozen tundra and CO2 from dying planets as well.   I agree with KarenRei that there's considerable uncertainty in the outcome and cloud formation and albedo are difficult to predict, but Earth would still likely be hot enough to cook a pot-roast on the surface in that orbit.   I don't see any way it wouldn't be, and possibly not enough to melt lead like the surface of Venus.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in the deep oceans (if the oceans survive, and I'm not sure they would), or in caves or permanently shaded caverns with access to underground water, some rugged life might survive.  </p>

<p>As to Earth's magnetic field, it's not all that relevant to your question.  Without a magnetic field, a planet is more likely to lose it's atmosphere, but that takes millions, if not tens or hundreds of millions of years.   Venus has already been stripped of much of it's lighter gases.   If you put Earth in Venus' orbit, that process would probably still happen, but it would take a long time and Earth's magnetic field would likely make the process slower.   </p>

<p>The reason Earth has a magnetic field is somewhat complicated and there's many good threads on Earth's magnetic field in <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/"">Earth Science Stack Exchange</a>, but in a nutshell, Earth's solid inner core, liquid outer core and Earth's relatively fast rotation period are key factors.  Earth's moon <em>might</em> play a role in maintaining it too.   Earth's magnetic field wouldn't go away if it was in Venus's orbit.   Venus lack of a magnetic field may be due to it's inner core not being solid and it could also be due to it's very slow rotation or a combination of both.   But Venus' atmosphere creates an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus#Induced_magnetosphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">induced magnetic field</a>, which helps it retain it's atmosphere.  But that's only relevant to a planet's climate over the very long term as atmosphere gets stripped by the solar wind. </p>

<p>A 3rd consequence of Earth in Venus' orbit is the Moon would be much closer to an unstable orbital region.   It would still probably remain in the Earth's orbit but it could be touch and go over thousands maybe millions of orbits, and the Moon would be significantly more perturbed and probably more eccentric at times and there's a chance Earth could lose the moon in this scenario, turning it into a dangerous near earth object that we would basically share an orbit with, and possibly crash into the Earth, or get tossed away by gravity assist.  </p>

"Accretion disks - why are they disk-shaped, rather than spherical?","826","","<p>So, the theory (briefly) about accretion disks is that stuff falling into the black hole will most likely not fall straight into it but will miss it and go into orbit, perhaps for a long time, perhaps for a short time, before finally falling in.  That makes sense.</p>

<p>But, why disks?  Wouldn't the matter falling into the BH be coming from all directions, and thus fall into orbits in all planes around the BH, not just one?  Or, is it that once there's a hint of ""plane preference"" in the debris, this will tend to be self-reinforcing, and anything subsequently falling into orbit around the BH will hit something in the disk, and so end up (perhaps after many collisions) being swept around in the disk as well?</p>
","<p>There's two different effects here, and they're both related to viscuous forces in the accreting matter.</p>

<p>First, if the infalling matter has some nonzero angular momentum vector $\mathbf{L}$, then consider a plane perpendicular to this vector. Due to its conservation, we can't get rid of rotation along this plane, but the component of angular momentum orthogonal to the plane is zero. As the accreting matter heats up and radiates away energy, that energy is taken from the gravitational potential, which is lessened by bringing the matter particles closer together. Thus, such interactions tend to flatten the matter into the plane orthogonal to its angular momentum.</p>

<p>But there's something more that happens for rotating black holes, as a combination of its gravitomagnetic field and viscous forces in the matter, that drives the matter to the plane of the black hole's rotation, regardless of its initial angular momentum. This is called the <em>Bardeen–Petterson effect</em> <sup>[1]</sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an accretion disk, viscosity causes each ring of gas to spiral inward toward the hole with a radial speed $|u^r|\ll\text{(orbital velocity)} = (M/r)^{1/2}$. If this were the only effect of viscosity, the warping of the disk would consist of a differential precession. Successive rings, each of smaller radius than the preceding, would have interacting longer with the [gravitomagnetic] field and thus would have precessed through successively larger angles... . As a result the disk would be radially twisted, but it would not be driven into the equatorial plane. However, the precession changes the disk's shear $\sigma_{jk}$ and thus changes the viscous forces; and these altered forces drive the disk toward the equatorial plane of the black hole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is only significant closer to the black hole, at $r\lesssim 100M$. At larger radii, the disk shape is due to the direction of the angular momentum of the matter instead.</p>

","<p>What's outside the observable Universe, we can't say anything about, but averaged over large enough scales ($\gtrsim$ a billion lightyears), it does indeed seem to be expanding uniformly.</p>

<p>However, the presence of mass, or more generally energy, retards the expansion.

<p>Conversely, in mass underdensities, i.e. the huge voids between clusters and filaments of gas and galaxies, expansion is increased (relative to denser regions).

<p>I understand that the Pillars of Creation are giant gas bubbles with different molecules that make it so visible and Proxima B is a relatively tiny planet that doesn't emit light but I cannot fathom how much greater the distance is from Proxima B and yet it is clearly much more visible. Shouldn't our current technology be able to view 'close up' images of Proxima B?</p>

<p>What am I missing here?</p>
","<p>Simply put, the Eagle Nebula (from which the Pillars of Creation originate) shines quite brightly, much more than Proxima Centauri (which is a red dwarf). First, we'll take a look at their absolute magnitudes (how bright an object actually is) and their apparent magnitudes (the brightness an object appears to have, based on its distance from us). Both are logarithmic, with lower numbers being brighter and higher numbers being dimmer.</p>

<p>The Eagle Nebula's absolute magnitude is a whopping -8.21. Meanwhile, Proxima has an absolute magnitude of 15.60. The formula relating absolute magnitudes and apparent magnitudes is:
$$M = m - 5 (\log_{10}{d}-1)$$</p>

<p>Where $M$ is the absolute magnitude, $m$ is the apparent magnitude, and $d$ is the distance, in parsecs. Plug in those numbers, and we find that the Eagle Nebula has an apparent magnitude of 6. Meanwhile, Proxima Centauri has an apparent magnitude of 11.13.</p>

<p>If we wanted to compare Proxima Centauri with the Eagle Nebula, we could use the formula:</p>

<p>$$v_b = 10^{0.4 x} = 10^{0.4×(11.13-6)} \approx 113$$</p>

"What is the degree of ionization is the solar photosphere?","822","","<p>I am wondering how many free electrons per baryon and how many free electrons per atom there are in the solar photosphere.  This number depends on the abundances of the various atoms found in the photosphere as well as each atom's ionization potential.</p>

<p>The book ""Introduction to Stellar Astrophysics"" by Boehm-Vitense, vol. 2, 1997 reprint, on page 76 claims that one out of every $10^4$ hydrogen atoms are ionized, so hydrogen is mostly neutral in the photosphere; however, there are other heavier elements with lower ionization potentials.  Boehm-Vitense goes through and calculates the fraction of ionization of iron but calculations for only two species present in the photosphere can hardly be considered comprehensive.</p>

<p>Whether you calculate these numbers yourself or provide a summary of a reference (with a link to that reference if possible) that has more details about ionization in the photosphere it will be appreciated.</p>

<p>My guess is that, since hydrogen has such a low degree of ionization, the number of electrons per baryon and per atom will be small, since hydrogen is the majority constituent of the photosphere.</p>

<p>So do stars qualify as being made of ""gas"" as the proverb would suggest, or is that considered a misconception?</p>
","<p>While I agree that it boils down to semantics, I actually disagree on the scientific use of the term in the comments. In astronomy, we know there's a difference between gas and plasma, but we almost always use the term ""gas"" when talking about what's in stars. E.g. ""the fraction of gas locked up in stars"" (as opposed to in the interstellar medium). We also talk about the metallicity of gas, meaning both gas and plasma. I think we only use the term plasma when specifically discussing properties that are unique to plasma, like being ""frozen"" in magnetic fields. And googling <a href=""https://www.google.dk/#q=%22ionized+gas%22+-plasma"" rel=""nofollow"">[""ionized gas"" -plasma]</a> (the '-plasma' is to get rid of articles explaining what plasma is) returns 243,000 hits, of which by far the most seem to be scientific papers and websites. </p>

"Does the Sun move?","813","","<p>I'm curious; does the Sun actually move? The concept behind the question is that if you wear a shirt and you move, does the shirt actually move? The Solar System orbits around the Milky Way, but does the Sun move?</p>
","<p>The Sun orbits in the Galactic potential. The motion is quite complex; it takes about 230 million years to make a circuit (meaning an orbital speed of around 220 km/s), but at the same time it oscillates up and down with respect to the Galactic plane every $\sim 70$ million years and also wobbles in and out every $\sim 150$ million years (this called epicyclic motion).</p>

<p>One can also measure how the Sun moves with respect to the average motion of the stars in the solar vicinity - the so-called local standard of rest. Estimates of the Sun's motion with respect to the LSR vary a little. According to <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9710077"" rel=""nofollow"">Dehnen (Walter!) &amp; Binney 1998</a> the Sun moves at 10 km/s inwards, at about 5 km/s faster than the average star tangentially to the Galactic centre and at about 7 km/s upwards out of the Galactic plane. Though as I mentioned previously, these motions are of an oscillatory nature around the mean value.</p>

<p>We could cast our net wider and ask how fast Sun moves with respect to the standard of rest defined by the cosmic microwave background - the local cosmological rest frame. The Sun moves at about 370 km/s relative to the CMB in the direction of the constellation Leo (as revealed by the dipole-like anisotropy in the CMB temperatures).</p>

"Martian Constellations","810","","<p>I was wondering if the constellations visible from Earth would also be visible from Mars.  Would they look the same but just shifted slightly in the sky due to the larger circumference of the orbit?</p>
","<p>The stars are so immensely far away that to the human eye there would be no noticeable difference. The nearest stars are moving roughly 1.5 arcsecond wrt. the background when viewed from Earth's position with half a year's interval (i.e. half a revolution around the Sun). Mars' orbit is only 50% larger, but the human eye cannot resolve better than roughly one arcminute.</p>

<p>However, the sky would look different for another reason: Although stars are point sources, on Earth stars are smeared out due to the atmosphere. On Mars, there's almost no atmosphere, but on the other hand there's lots of dust whirling around. Dust tends to absorb blue light more than red and thus <em>redden</em> objects. However, Martian dust happens to scatter red more than blue (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997JGR...102.9039O"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ockert-Bell et al. 1997</a>), so the stars should appear more blue. Also, the dust will scatter the Sun's light so much that no stars are visible during the day (as opposed to e.g. the Moon).
Note also that the north pole of Mars points not toward Polaris, but toward Deneb in Cygnus.</p>

<p>Since a shift in position of 1 AU (the distance from Earth to the Sun) corresponds to a shift in position of 1 arcsec for a star which is 1 pc (3.26 lightyears) away, if you want to go to a place where the nearest star (Proxima Centari; 1.3 pc away) has moved a full moon diameter, i.e. ½ a degree — you would need to travel roughly 2340 AU away, i.e. much farther away than Pluto, but still inside the Solar system.</p>

<p>Most stars are much farther away, however. The brightest stars that give the constellations their appearance are tens to hundreds of pc away, so to really change the constellation, you should go 10 or 100 times farther away, i.e. roughly 1 pc. In other words, the constellation <em>will</em> look (slightly, but conspicuously) different from out nearest neighbor stars.</p>

"Inclination of planets","800","","<p>Why do the planets have roughly the same inclination with respect to Earth?  Looking at the inclinations, which I got from <a href=""http://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tablesb.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tablesb.htm</a> , we see that Mercury has the highest inclination at about 7 degrees with respect to Earth.  Why are there no inclinations at approximately 90 degrees, or even slightly less, like 45 or 30?  My guess is after some long time, gravitational influence causes all the planets to line up.  </p>

<p>Question two is then : Do we know of any planetary systems where the planets have high degrees of inclination with respect to each other? </p>

<p>Pardon me if this has been answered before!</p>
","<p>While the other answer here and the link provided by Jeremy give excellent explanations, I believe a bit more nuanced reasoning is required.</p>

<p>Although the theory of planet formation is currently still incomplete, it is generally accepted that planets form in a so-called proto-planetary disk as a part of stellar formation process. This is backed up by several observation of such disk and even by
directly observed planets in systems where remnants of the disk are still present (most notably <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomalhaut_b"">Fomalhaut-b</a>).</p>

<p>However, exactly how these planets form is still unclear. A popular theory is that these planets form in place and therefore keep the orientation and inclination of the disk. This beautifully explains the Solar System and specifically why all planets have roughly the same orbital inclination. But that's not surprising as the model was specifically designed to do just that! Yet the Solar System does not have to be the only possible type of planetary  system, or even the most common for that matter. Indeed the study of exoplanets has confirmed that very different planetary systems are possible.</p>

<p>An alternative theory is that planets are created far away from the star and migrate inwards. During this migration multiple planets can interact with one-another and be pushed out of the disk plane to higher inclinations. They could even flip over completely and become retrograde.  </p>

<p>Now to come back to the actual question; the Solar planets probably have about the same inclination simply because they were created that way.</p>

<p>You are also right in saying that gravity will tend to align the planets. How this works physically is that the star can exerts a torque on the planet, which produces a tidal effect (like how the Moon creates <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide"">tides</a> on Earth). Over time this aligns the angular momentum of the planet to that of the star by pushing the planet towards the equatorial plane of the star.</p>

<p>As for your second question, yes, there are probably planetary systems which are misaligned with respect to the star. At least there are certainly planets that are not aligned with the equatorial plane of the star. The well named <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAT-P-11b"">HAT-P-11b</a> is a known example, but there are a lot more.</p>

<p>Note that for exoplanets the important parameter is not the inclination (which for exoplanets is the angle between the normal of the orbit and the line of sight), but rather the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"">obliquity</a> or tilt of the planet rotation with respect to the rotation of the star. </p>

<p>As for a third twist to this story, very recently there was a <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v511/n7511/full/nature13521.html#ref3"">discovery</a> of an entire proto-planetary disk that is misaligned with respect to the star, which opens the door to even stranger configurations.</p>

"Is a star powered by fission possible?","797","","<p>Stars can easily fuse atoms to give of heat and radiation. But at Wikipedia it said that only sub-iron atoms give of energy when fused and take energy when split, and post-iron atoms is the exact opposite. So, if enough heavy elements got together could a ""reverse star"" be made in which it gives of light and heat through means of fission? How long would such a star last, and why aren't they common, if they even exist?</p>
","<p>I think it's an interesting question.    The trick would be a sustained fission reaction, faster than half life, but slower than a chain reaction.   A chain reaction could hardly be considered ""star like"" - it would just explode.   </p>

<p>Lets say you had a planet sized object, maybe 100 parts Iron, basically inert, to 1 part Uranium  , which would generate heat through half life decay and some neutrons would spread from uranium to uranium - many wouldn't.  And as the object got hotter, more and more uranium would drift towards the center.  You'd have gradual heating, and the object, in time, would probobly begin to glow.     I'm guessing it's not possible using anything close to pure uranium, as the neutrons released in a uranium rich ball of matter would do 1 of 2 things - either blow the thing apart, or increase the rate of reaction and cause a chain reaction.   But i think, with the proper mix of uranium and inert elements, and the uranium spread out, not all in the center, you probobly could get something sort of star-like.   It would have much less available energy so it wouldn't burn nearly as long as a star.    At least, that's my thought experiment answer to this question.  </p>

<p>The problem with nothing but heavy, neutron rich elements is that, I don't see any way that wouldn't cascade and burn or blow up quickly.   The nuclear reaction is driven by neutrons hitting the nucleus with potential energy and as the reaction happens, more free Neutrons are produced which speeds up the reaction significantly.   A ball of of Uranium many miles across would undergo fission and explode.   A ball heavy enough to not explode - say, jupiter sized, it would heat up and burn quickly and then settle down and cool off slowly. - perhaps similarish to a star going Nova then settling into a white dwarf.  </p>

<p>If you have a material inside that slows the reaction, absorbs and re-admits Neutrons you could probobly generate a sustained burn - similar to what happens inside a nuclear plant while maintaining enough gravity to keep the object in one piece and over time, That would heat up and glow like a star in time and last for a while.   Planet sized, even moon sized would probobly be more than sufficient, but you'd need the material to slow the reaction and keep the Uranium spread out.   That's my take at least.  </p>

<p>If that statement is true, can someone elaborate what <strong>""everywhere in the universe, in every direction""</strong> means ? If not, <strong>why can we observe it in every direction ?</strong></p>
","<p>Until the Universe was 380,000 years old, it was filled with a gas of protons an electrons. There was also radiation, in thermal equilibrium with the matter, and because it was so hot, the protons and electrons couldn't form neutral hydrogen, since every time it ""tried"", an energetic photon would knock off the electron.</p>

<p>This gas was everywhere. And photons traveled and scattered in all directions:</p>

<p><sup>Photons (<em>purple</em>) scatter on free electrons (<em>green</em>), and both are mixed with protons (<em>red</em>).</sup></p>

<p>380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature had fallen sufficiently that neutral atoms could form (this is called <em>recombination</em>). The radiation, which until now had scattered continously on free electrons, could now stream freely between the atoms (this is called <em>decoupling</em>).</p>

<p>So they did. Still in all directions:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VkZyW.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VkZyW.png"" alt=""CMB2""></a></p>

<p>This free streaming is still taking place. Photons travel in all directions, and are everywhere. The photons that <em>you</em> are able to see, are the ones that started out at a particular distance from you, and in a particular direction, but other photons started out at smaller and larger distances, and in other directions. You just don't see them, because you happen to be right <em>here</em>. But a person in another place of the Universe would see the same as you.</p>

<p>The photons that we observe as the CMB come from a region we call the <em>surface of last scattering</em>, because it corresponds to the surface of a shell centered at us. But there is nothing special about this ""surface"", except that is consists of all points in the Universe that are so far from us, that it takes a photon roughly 13.8 billion years to travel. And because of the expansion, these points are now roughly 47 billion lightyears away from us.</p>

<p>In the figure below, the arrows show CMB photons. All have the same length; they start where they were emitted and end where they are today. What <em>we</em> observe as the CMB are all arrows that end at the Milky Way (in the center). Other arrows may be observed by other observers in other galaxies that have their own surface of last scattering around them.</p>

"Does gravity slow or speed light up?","796","","<p>The speed of light in a vacuum is presumably the fastest speed possible.  </p>

<p>if gravity bends the course of light, does this imply that gravity the retards light so it is moving at a slower speed?  If it affects its course, why cannot gravity affect its speed -- or does it?</p>

<p>And if gravity does affect the speed of light, what does that say about our measurements of the distance to the farthest observable object?  Could we assume that all the gravity effects across 15 billion light-years even themselves out?  Or is the actual distance across the observable universe subject to unknowable variations due to gravity effects?</p>
","<p>As Walter says, gravity doesn't bend light. Light travels along null geodesics, a particular type of straight path. Since (affine) geodesics don't change direction by definition, geometrically light trajectories are straight. Moreover, the speed of light in vacuum is $c$ in every inertial frame, regardless of whether or not spacetime is curved, although a curved spacetime inertial frames can only ever be local.</p>

<p>What can change, however, is the <em>coordinate speed</em> of light. Since coordinates are just labels for spacetime events, this is true even in completely flat spacetime. For example, in the Rindler coordinate chart, the Minkowski metric of flat spacetime takes the form
$$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\frac{g^2x^2}{c^2}\,\mathrm{d}t^2 + \underbrace{\mathrm{d}x^2 + \mathrm{d}y^2 + \mathrm{d}z^2}_{\mathrm{d}S^2_\text{Euclid}}\text{,}$$
where $g$ has units of acceleration. Since light travels along null ($\mathrm{d}s^2 = 0$) wordlines, the coordinate speed of light is
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{|gx|}{c}\text{,}$$
which is position-dependent and can even be $0$, as there is an apparent event horizon. An observer that's stationary in Rindler coordinates actually has proper acceleration $g$, so the Rindler chart of flat spacetime is a natural analogue of a ""uniform gravitational field"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if gravity bends the course of light, does this imply that gravity the retards light so it is moving at a slower speed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but what we can say is this. For weak, slowly-changing gravitational fields, the following  metric is appropriate to describe spacetime in terms of the Newtonian gravitational potential $\Phi$:
$$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\left(1+2\frac{\Phi}{c^2}\right)c^2\,\mathrm{d}t^2 + \left(1-2\frac{\Phi}{c^2}\right)\,\mathrm{d}S^2\text{,}$$
as we can readily calculate the coordinate speed of light (again $\mathrm{d}s^2 = 0$):
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = c\sqrt{\frac{1+2\Phi/c^2}{1-2\Phi/c^2}}\text{,}$$
and so by expanding its reciprocal in a Taylor-MacLaurin series, we find that light travels ""<em>as if</em>"" we had an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index"">index of refraction</a>
$$n = c \frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}S} \approx 1 - 2\frac{\Phi}{c^2} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\Phi^2}{c^4}\right)\text{.}$$</p>

<p>If we keep in mind that we are dealing with just the coordinate speed of light, then yes, we could say that gravity (rather, gravitational potential) retards light. Another way of thinking of this is like so: if we pretend that we're dealing with ordinary flat Minwkoski spacetime in the usual inertial coordinates, then we need a medium with the above refractive index to reproduce the trajectories of light. But of course taking this literally is not legitimate, since (1) the metric affects more than the propagation of light, and (2) such an interpretation would fail to explain gravitational redshift.</p>

<p>The latter approach is morally similar to what's described in Walter's answer, since it depends on a hypothetical comparison with flat spacetime. The difference is that by limiting ourselves to talk about what happens far from the gravitating bodies, Walter can sidestep the gravitational redshift issue, but then cannot ascribe any local refractive index (on the plus side, his approach is not limited to weak, slowly-changing gravity).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if gravity does affect the speed of light, what does that say about our measurements of the distance to the farthest observable object? Could we assume that all the gravity effects across 15 billion light-years even themselves out?</p>

Below is a plot I made from exoplanets.org. Almost certainly, the change in the nature of the relationship at around 0.1 Jupiter masses marks the transition from gas giants to ice giants and other rocky-type planets, but notice that gas giants can be just as dense as smaller planets. i.e. A classification based on just density wouldn't work, but mass and density gives more of a clue.</p>

In case of Neptune, the distance between Neptune and the Sun is so great that the sun would look like any other star (a bit brighter). In that case if I am looking at Neptune would I be able to see it ?</p>

<p>What about the other gas giants ?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/neptunefact.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NASA's Neptune fact sheet</a> states that Neptune's irradiance is $1.51 W/m^2$. This is roughly three orders of magnitude less than at Earth (at $1367.6 W/m^2$). This sounds like a lot, and it is quite an attenuation. So much that for example solar panels for interplanetary probes are not worthwile at these distances from the sun.</p>

<p>However, if you compare this with the <a href=""http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~schubert/Light-Emitting-Diodes-dot-org/Sample-Chapter.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">sensitivity of the human vision system</a>, this seems still pretty bright. A sunny day outside will be approximately $10^5 cd/m^2$. So equally on Neptune a sunny day will probably be $10^2 cd/m^2$.

<p>The perceived brightness of Neptune, as viewed from one of its moons, will not change, so yes, it will appear 1000 times less bright than earth does, but since you don't have any comparisons to brighter light sources there, you will perceive it as pretty bright!</p>

<p>As for the other gas giants, their surface irradiance will be equally higher, so they will in turn appear much brighter than Neptune.</p>

"Why isn't the star that created the black hole a black hole?","789","","<p>If the mass of a black hole is creating so much gravity that light cannot escape, why isn't the mass of the star that created the black hole (before it went supernova) trapping light as well?</p>

<p>By all accounts, that pre-supernova star should have boatloads more mass than the black hole post supernova, right?  Doesn't the star lose most of it's mass when going supernova?</p>
","<p>You are correct in saying that a star loses a lot of its mass in a supernova. However, there <em>is</em> a reason why the star still becomes a black hole. Actually, I suppose the question here is ""Why doesn't a star become a black hole before it even undergoes a supernova?""</p>

<p>There is a reason for a supernova (I'll assume you're talking about type II supernovae, which result from incredibly massive stars). Stars undergo nuclear fusion, and this leads to ""thermal pressure"", which counteracts the force of gravity. Without this pressure, gravity would indeed make a sufficiently large star collapse upon itself. Gravitational collapse occurs when there is not enough pressure to counteract gravity; the result is a spectacular supernova. So stars only become black holes (or other compact objects, such as neutron stars) when they cannot produce enough energy to counteract the force of gravity due to their own mass.</p>

<p>As for the first part of your question (sorry for answering in reverse), light in the area of a black hole cannot escape if it is inside its event horizon or on a trajectory towards it. The radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole is its Schwarzschild radius, which is proportional to the mass of the black hole. The reason this is non-applicable in stars is because the Schwarzschild radius in stars is deep inside its interior, and there is not a strong enough gravitational field to produce an event horizon to trap any light near it.</p>

"Where do new stars get their hydrogen from?","787","","<p>When stars run out of hydrogen, they explode (though they also use heavier elements for some time) and form nebulae. In the nebulae, new stars are born which use hydrogen as their fuel.</p>

<p>So, my question is from where do these new stars get hydrogen for their fuel?</p>
","<p>Stars only burn hydrogen in their core, where the temperature gets high enough for nuclear reactions to occur. They end their lives when they run out of fuel in the core, but lots of hydrogen still exists in their envelopes.</p>

<p>The Sun will burn 5-10% of its mass before exhausting its core. When this happens, the core will contract due to the radiation pressure disappearing. It then starts to burn hydrogen in a shell around the core. Eventually, when the Sun dies, it will have burned less than half of its hydrogen. Larger stars burn an even smaller fraction.</p>

<p>This means that, when stars die they still leave hydrogen behind for the next generation.</p>

<p>Galaxies can still run of of gas, though. Since after all, each $M_\odot$ of star formed burns <em>of the order of</em> $1\,M_\odot$, if a galaxy isn't fueled with new gas it will become depleted on a timescale of order $1$ over its <em>specific star formation rate</em> sSFR, which is its star formation rate SFR measured in Solar masses per year, divided by its stellar mass $M_*$ in Solar masses:
$$
t_\mathrm{depl} \sim \frac{1}{\mathrm{sSFR}}=\frac{M_*/M_\odot}{\mathrm{SFR}/M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}.
$$
For instance, a $10^9\,M_\odot$ galaxy with a star formation rate of $10\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ will become depleted of gas in roughly $10^8$ years.</p>

<p>Gas-depleted galaxies do exist, and the more depleted they are, the lower the star formation rate is (e.g. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5243"" rel=""nofollow"">Rose et al. 2010</a>), but in general the timescale is longer than the above, since galaxies also accrete gas from the surrounding circumgalactic medium.</p>

"Are there any common characteristics of habitable planets?","784","","<p>Recently, <strong>over a thousand exoplanets were confirmed in one huge sweep</strong> which is a huge achievement and in the mix <strong>a dozen or so possibly habitable planets were confirmed</strong> as well. This made me wonder, Are there any common characteristics of (possibly) habitable planets? If so, what are they? Could scientists use these characteristics to locate them? Or are they using these characteristics already?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Answers can be theoretical as well!</p>
","<p>I think I will answer your question from two vantage points. Firstly, what do we have to measure about a new exoplanet to consider it potentially habitable? Keep in mind that in detecting these 1000 or so new exoplanets, we've only gone so far as to show that they (statistically) exist and to measure some very very basic properties of them. It is on these very basic properties that we make our judgement of habitability and further research and observation is necessary to confirm these suppositions. When a new exoplanet is announced, we generally know the following information, which we use to determine habitability:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Distance from the star.</em> This is a crucial piece of the puzzle because it tells us generally how hot or cold the planet is. We presume that life cannot exist on planets which are boiling hot or freezing cold. This information can be ascertained from either the radial velocity method or the transit method.</li>
<li><em>Size of the planet.</em> Note here, size generally refers to diameter or radius. This is important because we want to generally know what type of planet we've detected. Gas giants are, well ... giant and inhospitable to life as we know it. We want to make sure the planet we've found is small enough that it is likely terrestrial. Although size is not a guarantee that it is terrestrial, its a piece of the puzzle. We can measure size by the transit method, however there is some degree of uncertainty to this process because we need to know the size of the host star to a good degree of accuracy, which is not always possible.</li>
<li><em>Mass of the planet.</em> This is a crucial component in determining habitability. Size alone may tell us that a planet is what we call a ""Super Earth"" or ""Sub Neptune"" in that it is slightly larger than our own planet. The problem with that is, if the planet sits on the size border between Earth and Neptune, how are we to know whether it is rocky or gaseous? This can be resolved by looking at the mass, which is ascertained by the radial velocity method. The mass combined with size, gives us density and density is a surefire way to know if the planet is made of dense material or light gases.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's really about it for basic information gleaned from simple planet detection methods. If you have distance from star, size, and mass (all of which you can get from the RV and transit methods) then you can presume that the planet is Earth-like and at a good temperature. That's enough to claim potential habitability, but not enough to actually show it can support human life. For that, you need to investigate the planet further and show it meets a variety of other conditions. As of know, some of those conditions are measurable with enough work, some aren't. These conditions may include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>An atmosphere with water in it.</em> We have the technology to measure this fact, but I'll say that it is very very difficult to do so and I don't know if anyone has really successfully shown water exists in an exoplanetary atmosphere (some have convincing evidence though). Generally, the process to do this is to measure the radius of the planet as a function of wavelength. Different wavelengths of light will refract through the atmosphere differently (just like in a prism) and so you measure a different radius of the planet (radius being the physical size of the planet plus the extent of the atmosphere) at different wavelengths. From this information, you can model what the atmosphere must be made of to cause the radius to change depending on wavelength. The issue with this process is that is requires removing all possible false detections and having a great signal to noise which is very hard.</li>
<li><em>A magnetosphere.</em> We believe this is a necessity for life. Every second of every day our planet is being bombarded with high energy particles from our Sun. Most of these particles are harmlessly deflected by our magnetosphere and so we're protected. Planets without this protection would have a hard time hosting life as that life would be destroyed by radiation (or at least life like us). There is currently no way to detect whether a planet has a magnetosphere, although I believe there are potential ideas on the chalkboard.</li>
<li><em>The presence of a moon.</em> This one is a bit iffy. Some people will argue our Moon has been instrumental to our development and for life in generally. The argument generally goes that the Moon has helped stabilize our tilt and thus kept our seasons and global weather well regulated. While we might be able to exist on a planet without such conditions, some believe life cannot begin on such a harsh planet without that regulating moon. There is also the benefit that the Moon has shielded us from a large number of impacts by taking the blow itself. Again, we could live on the planet, but the lack of a moon might not foster growth of life naturally. Moons, at this time, are out of our reach to detect.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are numerous other factors for what helps define whether a planet is habitable, be it by us or in hosting new life. The list could go on and on, but these are the major points I think.</p>

<p>Neither of these seem correct to me.  Could someone with real numbers weigh in on this?</p>

<p>I seem to recall that seeing artefacts is only possible in the latest high-res images taken from lunar orbit, and the telescope that uses the reflector gets back single photons on some trials and is a much more powerful laser than you could buy!  But, a continuous beam may be different? How big of a laser would you need to see a reflection with a viewing instrument that doesn't cost more than the laser?</p>
","<p>The video is hilariously wrong.</p>

<p>However, the principle of laser ranging is more or less right, and it does require the reflectors left behind by the astronauts on the Moon. It's just that the physics and technology involved are far beyond just pointing a toy laser at the Moon.</p>

<p>Project APOLLO (Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation) is actually doing this.</p>

<p><a href=""http://physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/apollo/basics.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/apollo/basics.html</a></p>

<p>You need a fairly large telescope to start with - both for collimating the outgoing light pulse, and for receiving as much of the reflection as possible. APOLLO uses a 3.5 meter telescope at the <a href=""http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Apache Point observatory</a>.</p>

<p>You need a laser that can generate a high-energy light pulse that is very short. The pulse is injected into the telescope's optical train and sent to the Moon. This is not a laser pointer; it's a high power Q-switched laser for research, <a href=""http://physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/apollo/onscope.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a device the size of a refrigerator</a>.</p>

<p>On the receiving end, you need a very good detector also plugged into the telescope. Of the many, many photons sent to the Moon in the pulse, only between 1 and 5 photons make it back down to the detector. You need a detector that can tell the extra 1 to 5 photons from the background noise of light coming from the Moon.</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding observing human artifacts on the Moon with terrestrial telescopes, I wish it was doable, but it's not. Again the YouTube video is wrong.</p>

<p>The biggest telescope accessible to amateurs has an aperture (diameter) in the range of 1 meter or a little bit larger (the aperture of the largest amateur-owned telescopes currently). The resolving power of a telescope (the size of finest details discernible) depends on aperture - if aperture is measured in mm and the resolving power in measured in arcseconds, then the formula is:</p>

<p>resolving power = 100 / aperture</p>

<p>So a 1 meter telescope has a resolving power of 0.1 arcseconds.</p>

<p>The distance from Earth to Moon is 384000 km (3.84 * 10^8 meters). With a resolving power of 0.1 arcseconds, the size of the smallest detail discernible on the Moon is:</p>

<p>detail size = distance_from_Earth_to_Moon * arctan(resolving power)</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>detail size = <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.84%20*%2010%5E8%20*%20arctan%280.1%20arcsec%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3.84 * 10^8 * arctan(0.1 arcsec)</a> = 186 meters</p>

<p>Anything smaller than 186 meters would be blurred into a single dot. There's nothing we've done on the Moon that's as big as that. It's not possible to see traces of human activity with amateur-level telescopes, even with extremely large meter-class dobsonian telescopes. Even with professional telescopes, we just don't have the aperture yet to resolve that kind of detail.</p>

<p>However, satellites in orbit around the Moon, such as the LRO, were able to image traces of the Apollo missions. That's because they are a lot closer to the site.</p>

If such a black hole appears near our solar system, are we going to survive? Is there any way not to fall in a black hole? </p>
","<p>When you say ""destroy anything in it's path"", that's true, but it's also true for a star, even a red-dwarf or white-dwarf star would effectively eat or destroy almost anything in their path.  </p>

<p>It's also worth mentioning that your scenario is very unlikely.  According to this <a href=""http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/encyc_mod3_q7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>, stars outnumber black holes 1,000 to 1 in the Milky way and most of those likely near the center of the Milky way.   There are probably a few stellar black holes within 75 or maybe 100 light years, based on probability and since they would be hard to detect (see Rob jeffries' comment).   But even so, one passing near enough to affect the Earth is very rare.  Story about a star passing within 1 light year of earth <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/119038/a-star-passed-through-the-solar-system-just-70000-years-ago/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  </p>

<p>So, onto your question: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If such a black hole appears near our solar system, are we going to
  survive? Is there any way not to fall in a black hole?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends how near and how big.   A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_black_hole"" rel=""nofollow"">stellar mass</a> black hole, with a mass range of about 3.8 solar masses to maybe 16 solar masses would need to get quite close to cause real problems.</p>

<p>Our Solar system has a very sparse <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">Oort Cloud</a>, extending perhaps almost 2 light-years and a much more densely packed, but still quite diffuse, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt"" rel=""nofollow"">Kuiper-belt</a>, mostly about 30-50 AU (less than a thousandth of a light year).   If we assume that a black hole, as much as 16 times the mass of our sun has similar orbital debris at larger orbits, an oort cloud around a 16 stellar mass black hole it could extend several light-years though still likely very diffuse, as well as perhaps a more densely packed asteroid belt and maybe even a few planets in the I dunno, 5-300 AU range or something.</p>

<p>The effect of a close pass gets pretty speculative and depends on the amount of objects in distant orbit around the black hole, but a pass as close as 1 or 2 light-years could increase the chance of a good sized comet or other objects striking Earth.   Not a guarantee at that distance, but an increased chance.  </p>

<p>Now if you get a pass-by of a few hundred AU to maybe 1,000 AU (about 1/50th to 1/100th of a light-year), you begin to get measurable Kuiper belt stirring up.  If the black hole has it's own Kuiper belt equivalent, this could create a significant increase in asteroids and meteors flying around the solar system.   A significant meteor strike on earth at this point becomes a distinct possibility, perhaps even likely and it could be a life killer and ocean evaporator.   </p>

<p>With proper technology, it might be possible to deflect any asteroids on an impact trajectory.   We'd probably observe multiple impacts on other planets too and at this distance, our solar system might even pick up a planet from the black hole if there was one in distant orbit.   </p>

<p>At about 100-200 AU, the black hole has a chance of pulling some of the outer planets out of our solar system.  It could also visibly alter Saturn's or maybe Jupiter's orbits and stir things up in our solar-system pretty good.</p>

<p>That's the most likely effect of a very near pass of either a star or black hole is a stirring up of more distant orbiting objects and a significant increase in the chance of planet killing or at least, dinosaur killing impact, but it needs to be very close.  The article I linked above says that the star that passed within 0.8 light years (about 50,000 AU), some 70,000 years ago didn't measurably increase comet impacts.   </p>

<p>To measurably change the Earth's orbit, maybe 30-50 AU.  About the distance of Uranus or Pluto.   This wouldn't pull the Earth away from the Sun, but it could change the Earth's orbit enough to alter the seasons and change climate on Earth.  An elongation of our orbit could make the seasonal changes bigger and change the length of a year.  The gas giants would all be moved.   If the Earth survives any bombardment from a pass that close, it might quickly enter a new ice age, as one possible outcome, but we might be able to fix that by burning lots of fossil fuels.  :-)</p>

<p>At somewhere around Maybe 12-20 AU, the Earth might get moved too much for us to adapt, perhaps outside of the Goldilocks Zone.  </p>

<p>At somewhere around 5-10 AU (estimates are pretty rough), but this is where things get really interesting.   We begin to see a measurable increase in tides and at this point and we could lose the moon.   The earth could also get pulled outside the solar system, thrown into the sun or captured by and end up in an orbit around the black hole.   We might begin to see a small tidal bulge on the sun from the black hole and a corresponding small increase in solar output, but that might require the black hole to be closer. Not sure.  If the black hole gets close enough to the sun it could stretch the sun somewhat oblong and start to draw some solar gases towards it, but that might be pretty close, maybe 1 or 2 AU.</p>

<p>At maybe 3-6 AU, depending on the relative velocities, the sun might get captured into an fairly close orbit around the black hole, turning our solar-system into a binary and the planets could end up pretty much anywhere in that scenario.</p>

<p>At 1 or maybe 2 AU from Earth, we could see some cracking of the Earth's crust and a big increase in volcanoes and earthquakes.   </p>

<p>Even at 1 AU, the black hole still wouldn't be visible unless it's acquired enough matter to form a bright accretion disk, in which case it might be very bright, but still visibly very small like a super bright star in the sky.   Without an accretion disk the gravitational lensing should be visible by telescope but not to the naked eye.</p>

<p>Much closer than that and it hardly matters.   The Earth's would be largely be re-surfaced with magma and the oceans would probably boil.   All that said, the Earth still isn't being eaten.  To eat the Earth a black hole would need to pass somewhere around maybe 5 or 10 million miles.  Super-close for another stellar object.</p>

<p>I welcome correction if any of my math is broken, but that's my roughly calculated estimate.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.askamathematician.com/2012/02/q-what-would-happen-if-a-black-hole-passed-through-our-solar-system-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> with some of the same conclusions.   </p>

<p>Edit - due to comment above</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I mean a supermassive black hole, like the one we have in the center
  of Milkyway</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My long answer above is basically gravitational effects when the black hole is in the general vicinity of the solar system.   That kind of very close pass happens very rarely, but the odds of a black hole hitting earth is very slim.  The odds of a black hole passing close enough to our solar-system and stirring things up in an undesirable way, also unlikely but more likely than a black hole actually hitting earth.</p>

<p>The most likely effect is some gravitational swirling (if you will) due to the massive object passing kinda close to the solar system, and as a result, possible impacts, possible orbital changes - stuff that wouldn't be fun, even if it passes outside the orbit of Pluto.</p>

<p>With a super-massive black hole, it's basically the same answers but the distance can be much further out.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*"" rel=""nofollow"">Sagittarius A</a> is about 4 million solar masses, compared to a stellar mass black hole which is about 4 to 16 solar masses.   That's 250,000 to a million times bigger, so equivalent gravitational occurs at the square root of that, about 500 to 1,000 times further.</p>

<p>The tidal effects are actually much smaller.   A 4 to 16 stellar mass black hole could fly by at roughly Pluto's orbital distance (30-50 AU) and as it passes, it could pull Jupiter into a very different orbit, perhaps even away from the sun, but a super-massive black hole fling past some 500 times the distance of pluto (about 1/3 to 1/2 light year) would exert the same gravitational tug, but that tug would be much the same across the entire solar system, so the entire solar system could be pulled effectively into orbit around the super-massive black hole without changing shape too much.  It still be visibly very tiny though the gravitational lensing might be visible to the naked eye at that point, but not much bigger than a star.  </p>

<p>The real danger with a super-massive black hole passing within a few light-years of our solar system is the stuff it carries with it.   Super-massive black holes are orbited by stars and presumably all the stuff that generally orbits stars, like planets, moons, asteroids, comets.   All that stuff would approach our solar-system long before the black hole came close and that's the mostly likely answer.  Our solar-system would likely be pelted by orbital debris when the super-massive black hole was still a few light-years away.   I don't think I should try to guess how many but a super-massive black hole would carry with it orbiting debris for several light years.   </p>

<p>My quick and dirty answer to the super-massive question.   You mgiht think a black hole of that size would strip the atmosphere off the earth and stuff like that, but with a super-massive black hole, the tidal forces are much smaller at the event horizon.  The atmospheric striping and earthquakes and other effects don't happen until it's enormously close, at which point the earth would be orbiting around it quite fast, perhaps fast enough that the night sky might visibly appear to spin to the naked eye.  We could get pretty close to it before life on earth became unlivable, provided we're not bombarded by orbiting debris first.  </p>

<p>There could be other effects.  Gamma rays from any matter falling into the black hole or perhaps strong magnetic effects.  More precise predictions gets a bit difficult for me.</p>

<p>That's my layman's attempt at an answer anyway.</p>

<p>The same celestial objects (stars, planets, the Moon) could be seen every year. So, people figured out there was a pattern to it. </p>

<p>At first, geocentrism was prevalent due to prejudice and the  stars ""orbiting"" the Earth in a clean manner (no strange effects). If you stare up at night, stars move in a circle with the center approximately at the Pole Star. This can be mistaken for the Star moving around the Earth.</p>

<p>Objects like visible planets (with retrograde motions) were relatively small in number &mdash; we have the inner solar system plus Jupiter and Saturn, so people gave plausible explanations for these. Ptolemy theorized that the planet orbits around a ""ghost point"", for example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qIV8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>(This is called the epicycle theory)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>how we know for certain today that planets really move in orbits around the Sun</em> (i.e., rather than moving but not around the Sun or moving around the Sun in a shape that is not a regular path).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The heliocentric model came up because of various smaller discoveries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jupiter has moons, so not all celestial bodies orbit the Earth</li>
<li>Venus has full phases, but in the geocentric model only a small subset of the phases should be visible</li>
<li>Theories like epicycles were not as accurate as they were expected to be, and people started realizing this over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all this in mind, the simple solution of heliocentrism explains everything in a much cleaner fashion, without leaving much doubt in mind. Kepler's laws make much cleaner predictions.</p>

<p>Remember that people had catalogs of astronomical data to verify things with.</p>

<p>Later on, once Newton came up with his theory of gravitation, Kepler's laws made even more sense (though I believe that Newton formulated his theory with some inspiration from Kepler's laws). I'm pretty sure that there were on-Earth experiments to verify the inverse-square as well.</p>

<p>Nowadays, sending probes to space and getting a different perspective has confirmed this with 100% certainity for us. More or less.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: A good answer should tell what kind of telescope an amateur would need, what measurements they would need to make, then what calculations they would have to perform to get the inclination (or the ""instantaneous angular measurement from the ecliptic at the time of measurement"").</p>
","<p>Any telescope can be made to give you the information that you are looking for.  The first thing that you will need to know is the location of the ecliptic which varies throughout the year.  Or are you looking to find in relation to the the celestial equator?</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator</a></p>

<p>Either way, you would start of the same by find the Declination (D) and Right Ascension (R.A) of the object in question.  You do not need a telescope to find this, unless you are unable to see the object with the naked eye.  If the telescope has a polar mount and is properly set up.  You can read the R.A. and D off of the mount.  </p>

<p>Otherwise it will require some trigonometry and knowing where you are (at least your latitude)</p>

<p>You will need to determine the Altitude and Azimuth of the object.  Which is really just the direction from North and the angle from horizontal that your telescope is pointing.  You could do this with a compass and protractor or even an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolab"">astrolabe</a>.  Knowing this you can then convert to R.A and D with the following formulas:</p>

<p>$$RA = \arctan(\frac{- sin(Az) \times \cos(Alt)}{\cos(Lat) \times \sin(Alt) - \sin(Lat) \times \cos(Az) \times \cos(Alt)})$$</p>

<p>$$Dec = \arcsin(\sin(Lat) \times \sin(Alt) + \cos(Lat) \times \cos(Alt) \times \cos(Az))$$</p>

<p>You are looking for the inclination to the ecliptic, so you are mostly concerned with the declination.  The ecliptic changes in declination throughout the year from 0 at the equinox to +/- 23.5 at the solstice.  So your inclination from the ecliptic would be the Declination of your object +/- the Declination of the ecliptic. </p>

We look for conditions on planets that meet certain criteria e.g close enough to a sun for water, environments for carbon based life forms to exist. I was wondering; why cant an alien be a sulphur based life form that for the sake of argument drinks lead and breathes in chlorine like we do oxygen.</p>
","<p><sub>I want to start with a disclaimer that I'm not a chemist and hopefully I don't screw any of the chemistry up. If I do, please let me know.</sub></p>

<p>I think <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/20858/why-do-aliens-have-to-be-carbon-based-lifeforms#comment35226_20858"">Bill Oertell</a> hit the nail on the head. Just because you can imagine a species which can drink lead doesn't mean it's actually physically possible. Only specific atoms can form the basis of the (extremely) complex organic molecules needed to form life and Carbon happens to be the atom which can do that. The primary reason for this is that Carbon has four valence electrons and its outer shell can hold eight, allowing it to form strong and varied bonds that most other atoms just can't form. As such, Carbon is the most logical element to form the backbone of organic molecules.</p>

<h3>Other ___-based Lifeforms</h3>

<p>Moving down the periodic table, you can see that Silicon has the same properties (4 valence elections, 8 possible) and you might be inclined to think that you could form some sort of silicon based life. This topic has been <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry#Silicon_biochemistry"" rel=""noreferrer"">widely considered</a>, but you run into a number of problems that make Silicon-based life unfeasible. The primary reason is that Silicon is just much bigger and more massive than Carbon (having a nucleus with 28 nucleons compared to Carbon's 12). This makes it harder for Silicon to form the necessary bonds that Carbon can readily form and you're out of luck right form the get-go. Similar issues occur with other ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group"" rel=""noreferrer"">Carbon group</a>"" elements, except they're even further exacerbated by even higher masses.</p>

<p>There are many other ""organic"" configurations chemists have considered such as boron-based life or sulfur-based life but they all have some sort of problem that makes it hard for it to exist. Some are more possible than others, but Carbon-based life, as we know it, just seems to be the best solution. If you gave someone all the elements in the periodic table and said, make organic life, they'd probably come back with Carbon-based life because its the easiest. You don't have to overcome as many obstacles.</p>

<h3>Observations</h3>

<p>Aside from the impracticality of non-Carbon based life, you have to consider that everything we've seen in the universe, as far as organic chemistry goes, points to the fact that the Universe is filled with Carbon-based chemistry. Astronomers have been able to look out at comets, interstellar dust clouds, and all sorts of places and time after time, they see complex, Carbon-based, organic molecules. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.astrochem.org/docs/IAU251_Salama.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">We've found Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) all over the solar system and galaxy</a>,</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29368984"" rel=""noreferrer"">Astronomers have also found things like i-propyl cyanide</a> in meteorites and in interstellar dust $-$ an organic molecule which is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl_cyanide#Importance_in_life.27s_origin"" rel=""noreferrer"">necessary ingredient in amino acids</a>,</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/solar-system/news/a25235/ceres-organics/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Organic molecules have been found (and believed to have formed) on Ceres.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The point I'm driving at here is that the universe seems ready-made to start forming Carbon-based life everywhere. Everywhere we look, we see organic molecules which have Carbon as the backbone of their structure. Nowhere do we see complex silicon based molecules (or something even crazier). This is highly suggestive that Carbon is the way to go if you want to quickly and easily form life.</p>

<p>There are probably a 100 other reasons to favor Carbon over something else, but that delves into more complicated chemistry than I've touched on here and I'm not as knowledgeable about that. I would think this question would get a more in-depth chemistry answer on the <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/"">chemistry stack exchange</a>.</p>

"Will we start seeing galaxies disappear due to Universe expansion?","749","","<p>Does the fact that universe is currently expanding at an accelerating rate means that far far away objects (<em>FAO</em>) might start disappearing with time, set aside the ""red shift""? </p>

<p>I'm saying this because from what I understand until now:</p>

<ul>
<li>we receive photons from <em>FAO</em> that were emitted long long ago</li>

<ul>
<li>at t=-11 billion years(By), photons are emitted in a slow expanding universe, and today we can view the object as it was</li>
<li>at t=-2 By, the object moves faster than speed of light, so photon emitted at that time will never reach us, even if we wait the 9 by + ""expansion correction"" needed...</li>

<li>If we observe a galaxy <em>today</em>, it may recede faster than light <em>now</em>, but when it emitted the light we see now, it did not.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both are incorrect.</p>

<strong>Intuitive explanation</strong>

<p>This is most easily seen in a spacetime diagram. But before showing that, a somewhat intuitive way of understanding this apparent paradox is to consider the journey of the photon from the reference frame of the emitting galaxy: In this frame, the photon leaves the emitter with a velocity $v=c$ (as it should), but since its velocity is always $v$ <em>locally</em>, then in the frame of the emitter, its velocity increases without bounds. This is not a proof, but may help to show that ""light may travel faster the the speed of light"".</p>

<p>Now to the spacetime diagram. My favorite version is from the classic paper by <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Davis &amp; Lineweaver (2004)</a>, but I actually like better this version from <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/63780/70207"">Pulsar's excellent (!) post</a>:</p>

<strong>Real example of a galaxy that has always been, and always will be, receding with superluminal velocity</strong>

<p>Such a diagram shows age (or, equivalently, size) of the Universe, as a function of the corresponding comoving distance$^1$ of events. A lot of things are going on in this diagram, and I'll refer to Pulsar's answer for an interesting discussion of all this. For our purposes, consider the only thing the I have added to the figure: the world line — i.e. the ""path"" taken through spacetime of some object — of the galaxy <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GN-z11"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GN-z11</a>, seen as a vertical dashed line at a comoving distance $d_C \simeq 32.2\,\mathrm{Gly}$. It is vertical, because it doesn't move in comoving coordinates. We observe it at a redshift of $z=11.09$, which means that the light we see (moving at 45º toward <em>our</em> worldline which is at $d_C=0$) was emitted when the Universe was roughly 400 Myr old. At that time, GN-z11 was receding at a velocity $v\simeq4c$!</p>

<strong>Hubble sphere and event horizon</strong>

<p>The innermost green bubble (labeled ""$v_\mathrm{rec}=c$"") is the <em>Hubble sphere</em>, defined such that at any point in time, everything outside recedes faster than $c$. Meanwhile, the red line shows the <em>event horizon</em>, which defines the boundary between everything that <em>can</em> eventually be observed (light red region), and everything that cannot. A subset of this is out <em>past lightcone</em> (orange region) which is stuff that we have already observed (or at least have had the chance to).</p>

<p>Everything lying in between the Hubble sphere and the event horizon consists of events that we have been, or will eventually be, able to see, but which recede faster than the speed of light when it emits the light we see.</p>

<p>As you can see the region becomes narrower with time$^2$, meaning that the accelerated expansion of the Universe makes it harder and harder for photons emitted far away to reach us. We will never be able to see galaxies that today are farther away than roughly 17 Gly. But galaxies that are nearer <em>will</em> be seen (if we look), and a subset of these — namely the ones with $14\,\mathrm{Gly} \lesssim d_C \lesssim 17\,\mathrm{Gly}$ — are currently receding faster than the speed of light.</p>

<strong>The size of the observable Universe always increases</strong>

<p>The observable Universe is defined as the region within which light has had the time to reach us. The ""edge"" of this is called the <em>particle horizon</em>, and as seen from the blue line, it always increases its distance from us (in comoving coordinates, and thus even more so in physical coordinates). In comoving coodinates, it reach a maximum size of roughly 63 Gly. That means that more and more galaxies will enter our observable Universe, but as time goes they will do so at an ever-decreasing pace, asymptotically reaching a finite value (of 5 trillion galaxies, more or less). Once inside the particle horizon, a galaxy will never leave. It will, however, keep increasing its distance from us in physical coordinates, as well as its speed, and thus redshift without bounds and fade to black.</p>

<p>Hubble's law (the law that deals with the expansion of the universe) applies to the expansion of space itself, i.e., if two objects stationary to each other that had no force between them were left alone the distance between would increase with time because space itself is expanding.

<p>In the case of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies (and all galaxies for that matter) there is a force between them: gravity. The gravitational force between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies has produced an acceleration that is causing the two galaxies to be moving towards each other faster than the space between them is expanding as calculated by Hubble's law. However, the vast majority of galaxies lie far enough away from the Milky Way that the gravitational force between us and them is small compared to the Hubble expansion and Hubble's law dominates.</p>

"Why are most planetary orbits nearly circular","740","","<p>In our solar system, with the exception of Pluto all planets follow a relatively circular orbit around the Sun, at the same inclination. They also all rotate in the same direction, none are 'retrograde'. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bY8GT.gif"" alt=""Solar System""><br>
An image of the orbits of our solar system.</p>

<p><strong>How and why have they all formed into these orbits? Is this reflected in most orbital systems? What factors affect the orbits of newly formed systems?</strong></p>
","<p>The combination of the conservation of angular momentum and gravity give you the inclination and direction.  Gravity will condense material in the axis direction of the angular momentum, and collisions and gravitational interactions will damp oscillations in that direction, forming a disk of material.  The angular momentum resists gravity in the plane perpendicular to the axis, maintaining the extent of the disk.  Over time, the direction of rotation of the angular momentum is the direction of the vast majority of the material, due to collisions and interactions with that smaller population going the wrong way on a one-way street.</p>

<p>The circularity of the orbits is the result of a more dynamical process.  Hopefully someone else here can explain it better than the following.  My simplistic understanding is that a bunch of orbits crossing each other is not stable.  Planets and planetesimals have their orbits changed continuously until such time as they settle into orbits that have fewer interactions with other bodies.  Sort of a natural selection.  In the long haul, this results in a relatively stable configuration with circular zones that tend to not interfere with the other circular zones.  In fact, this is now part of the definition of the word ""planet"", in that to be called such, a planet needs to clear the neighborhood of its orbit.  Though its not clear how it could occur, a bunch of elliptical zones that happen to be co-aligned would also not be stable since orbits precess due to various influences.</p>

<p>Where the material was less dense than where the planets are currently must certainly have many objects in eccentric, retrograde, and/or highly inclined orbits.  Pluto is the first hint at that, with a relatively high inclination and eccentricity compared to the planets.  Sedna is far more eccentric.</p>

<p>As for other systems, I'm sure there must be some oddballs out there.  However the <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7942"" rel=""nofollow"">Kepler mission has observed mostly circular orbits for planets around other stars</a>.</p>

"Why does a planet rotate and revolve?","740","","<p>Why do planets rotate and revolve in the universe?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1E8I.gif"" alt=""rotating earth""></p>
","<p>As the planets evolve during their protoplanetary stage and accrete materials from the protoplanetary disks, which are gravitationally collapsing interstellar dust and gases, these accreted particles retain some of the angular momentum from the materials they form from and being in constant motion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OLk0J.png"" alt=""accretion period of the protoplanetary disk""></p>

(Source: <a href=""http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~masset/moviesmpegs.html"">Frédéric Masset</a>)</sup></p>

<p>One nice description for this angular momentum preservation, and why the planets appear to rotate faster than their surrounding protoplanetary disk goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conservation of angular momentum explains why an ice skater spins more
  rapidly as she pulls her arms in. As her arms come closer to her axis
  of rotation, her [rotation] speed increases and her angular momentum remains the
  same. Similarly, her rotation slows when she extends her arms at the
  conclusion of the spin.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So it could be described as this axial rotation of planets resulting in conservation of the angular momentum of the materials in the protoplanetary disk, forming during the accretion period of the planetary system as the protoplanets <em>gain in weight</em>, and preserve this angular momentum due to inertia of their radial velocity.</p>

"Can I measure the moon's gravity?","737","","<p>Since I learned about Newton's gravity law, I wonder if I can measure the moon's gravity using (almost) no special equipment. The best I could come up with is a pendulum, which is in a resting position. The moon (at the horizon) will pull on the weight at the bottom of the pendulum and cause it to shift. 6 hours later, with the moon above or below the pendulum, the weight should be back. Maybe we could detect the shift, just like we see the tides. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rQZ5q.jpg"" alt=""moon puling on a pendulum""></p>

<p>Running the math for a 5 meter long pendulum and 1 kg mass, I get an amplitude of 0,017 mm. I fear that external forces (wind, unstable surface, ...) will be bigger than this effect. </p>

<p>So my question is: <em>is it possible (again, without specific equipment) to measure or detect the moon's gravitational force? What would be the best way to measure/detect it?</em></p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are off by quite a bit. There is essentially no horizontal deflection when the Moon is at the horizon. The maximum horizontal deflection occurs when the Moon is about 45 degrees above or below the horizon.</p>

<p>The tidal acceleration at some point on the surface of the Earth due to some external body (e.g., the Moon) is the difference between the gravitational acceleration toward that external body at the point in question and the gravitational acceleration of the Earth as a whole toward that body:</p>

<p>$$\vec a_{rel} = GM_\text{body} \left(\frac {\vec R - \vec r} {||\vec R - \vec r||^3} - \frac {\vec R} {||\vec R||^3} \right)$$

<ul>

<li>$\vec r$ is the displacement vector from the center of the Earth to the point in question on the surface of the Earth.</li>

<p>The resultant force looks like this:<br>
<img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Field_tidal.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Note that the tidal force is away from the center of the Earth when the Moon is directly overhead or directly underfoot, toward the center of the Earth when the Moon is on the horizon, and horizontal when the Moon is halfway between directly overhead/underfoot and on the horizon.</p>

<p>The tidal force is maximum when the Moon is directly overhead, and even then it's only about 10<sup>-7</sup> <em>g</em>. You need a sensitive instrument to read that. A simple pendulum or a simple spring will not do the trick.</p>

"What are practical considerations for backyard radio-astronomy detection of black holes?","736","","<p>Evidently, direct observation of a black hole for an amateur astronomer, such as described for what professionals do in the question <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/24/how-are-black-holes-found"">""How are black holes found?""</a> would be nigh on impossible, so the observations would be based on their effects of the surrounding matter (specifically, accretion disks and jets) and more likely detecting the radiation signals.  </p>

<p>Given that the locations of many black holes are known, what practical considerations would a backyard radio-astronomer need to consider to attempt to do detect black holes?</p>

<p>Amateur radio-astronomy detection of pulsars and gamma ray bursts are discussed practically in <a href=""http://www.radio-astronomy.org/pdf/sara-beginner-booklet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Introduction to Radio Astronomy</a> (Society of Radio Astronomers), this question is to see what practical considerations would be needed to extend those techniques to detecting black holes.</p>
","<p>The resolution/error box. Radioastronomy has always been hindered by the resolution, because it is inversely proportional to the size of the telescope and making larger telescopes (even with interferometry) is not always easy. No amount of modern technology can substitute for a large effective diameter.  (When I say <em>effective</em> I'm including interferometry here; either way one needs a large area to build on).</p>

<p>Let's take a look at Reber's initial paper<sup><a href=""http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1944ApJ...100..279R&amp;classic=YES"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></sup> where he first mapped the sky:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sP9tg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the diagram on the left, from top down, the three peaks in the contour map are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_A"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cas A</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_A"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cyg A</a>, and finally <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sgr A</a>. The latter two have black hole origins, the former is a supernova remnant.</p>

<p>The resolving power of Reber's telescope here seems to have been 6 degrees, and it was 31.4 feet in diameter (and he focused on a 1.9m wavelength).</p>

<p>Now, by the Rayleigh criterion, the angular resolution is proportional to the wavelength divided by the diameter. As mentioned before, this is the major limiting factor for radioastronomers, and will be what holds amateur radioastronomers from making great telescopes &mdash; amateurs usually don't have acres or land in which to build a good interferometer (let alone the precision), and single-dish telescopes can't be made too large by an amateur. One may notice that I'm citing rather old observations here, on old telescopes; however given that radioastronomy <em>technology</em> has not changed nearly as much as <em>size</em> has, it should be OK to compare amateur telescopes with the smaller telescopes of the past.</p>

<p>Now, Cyg A was the first to be identified as a black hole, even though the radio-brightness of Sgr A was discovered at the same time. I'm focusing the rest of my analysis on Cyg A for this reason, as it stands to reason that the first confirmed BH out of the brighter radio sources would have more prominent indicators that it is a black hole.</p>

<p>Let's have a look at Cyg A with a better resolution:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O9QGB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>(From this paper<sup><a href=""http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1969MNRAS.146..221M&amp;classic=YES"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a></sup>, using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryle_Telescope"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">5km array</a>)</p>

<p>Note that the black blob in the center is the actual galaxy (probably an optical photograph superimposed on the contour map).</p>

<p>We can see that the lobes are less than a minute wide. (The actual galaxy is around <a href=""http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/datasearch?objname=Cyg%20A&amp;search_type=Diameters&amp;of=table"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">50 arcseconds wide</a>)</p>

<p>To me, the most interesting thing that one would like to see here are the gas jets coming from the central galaxy. As mentioned in my answer <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/224/28"">here</a>, these radio-emitting gas jets are in a steady line over thousands of light years, indicating that they come from some sort of cosmic gyroscope which has been steady for very long. However, even with the Ryle telescope the 1969 people could not get a picture of them; just a slight hint of their existence from the shape of the lobes.</p>

<p>Alright, so no gas jets. What else can indicate a black hole? They could try to look at the lobes themselves. They do not directly indicate the existence of a black hole, but their shape hints towards them being formed from jets (this is pretty much in retrospect).</p>

<p>However, with lobe dimensions of less than an arc minute, there's not much an amateur can get here, either. It's possible that a really good amateur telescope would just manage to notice that there are two lobes, but not much else as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>The other interesting bits would be the central galaxy itself, but it's too small. In the optical region one may have a chance of seeing Baade's ""colliding galaxies"" (it only <em>looks</em> like a pair of colliding galaxies). The gravitational effects (lensing, etc) are really only visible in the optical and beyond, for it to be visible in the radio we would need to be very lucky and have a huge radio source pass behind Cyg A &mdash; not happening anytime soon.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm pretty sure that a similar analysis would work for Sgr A or any other black hole candidate; the gas jets would be too small for an amateur radiofrequency resolution, and the gravitational effects of the black hole would only work well in the optical and X ray frequencies.</p>

","<p>Go with Option 1 (135mm) as it has bigger light collecting area, i.e. diameter of primary mirror. It will enable you to see faint objects and it will also help you to see the dim objects under a greater zoom eyepiece, e.g. 4mm or 10mm.</p>

<p>Also, don't fool yourself with the bigger numbers advertized by telescope vendors like 238X zoom or 300X zoom.</p>

<p>First, these are zooming power using Barlow lenses also the more you zoom in on any object, the less light you gather on the mirror and hence objects will look much fainter in appearance. I will suggest the 10mm eyepiece with a 135mm telescope (Option 1) will be sufficient for you to observe planets like Jupiter, its Galilean satellites, Saturn's rings and also many Messier objects like Andromeda Galaxy M31, the Honey Bee Cluster, and open star clusters in the Auriga constellation.</p>

<p>Also bear in mind that you live in a country area closer to sea like here in India and the weather will be hot and humid. 
So ask the vendor about special coating which protects the mirror from rusting (spots on mirror due to moisture) during the humid monsoon season as at least for 4 months it will be humid.</p>

"What defines a stable orbit?","732","","<p>While looking for a way to prolong an orbit via moon power I was faced with the parameters of what would be a stable orbit by length of time an object stayed in orbit, What is the definition of a stable orbit? Is there a such an orbit since all orbits eventually degrade?</p>

<p><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/19643/can-the-moons-gravity-provide-enough-force-to-keep-an-object-in-earths-orbit"">Can the moon&#39;s gravity provide enough force to keep an object in Earth&#39;s orbit?</a></p>
","<p>There's no clearly defined definition of what a stable orbit is.  Orbits can last for hundreds or thousands of years, millions, billions or even trillions of years.  There's no neat and tidy definition between stable and unstable.</p>

<p>Hubble for example, orbits the Earth every 97 minutes, and in a few years, primarily slowed by the very slight air resistance, it is expected to fall to the Earth.   Many satellites, because their equipment doesn't last forever, are designed to gradually slow by air resistance and fall to the Earth after a few decades of operation.   Satellites can be positioned where they stay in orbit much longer simply by moving them a bit further out, but there's little benefit to that.   It's advantageous to have satellites fall to the Earth after they've served their usefulness.</p>

<p>Orbits around the Moon are more unstable than orbits around the Earth for 2 reasons.   One, because the Moon is gravitationally lumpy so low orbits around the Moon don't stay in place very long.  See <a href=""https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/06nov_loworbit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  </p>

<p>and two, because the Earth is gravitationally dominant, so the Moon doesn't have a very big hill sphere.  Celestial mechanics doesn't like satellites to have satellites.   See <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/109666/can-moons-have-moons/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/44-our-solar-system/the-moon/general-questions/104-can-moons-have-moons-intermediate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  Our moon could have a satellite, but it likely wouldn't be stable for very long, at least, not long in a celestial time-scale.</p>

<p>Trojan points, L4 and L5 are generally stable in a System where the larger body (Earth) is more than 25 times as massive as the smaller body (moon), but our Moon's orbit is too eccentric and too chaotic for lunar Trojan points to be stable for any period of time.     Earth's L4 and L5 points around the sun are more stable and there are a few small asteroids in Earth's Trojan points.  The Moon's L4 and L5 aren't stable cause the Moon wobbles too much in it's orbit.  Eccentricity and perturbations tend to destabilize L4 and L5 points.   That said, the Moon's L4 and L5 are more stable than L1, L2 and L3.   </p>

<p>Mars moon Phobos is in a <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/14258/phobos-might-only-have-10-million-years-to-live/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decaying orbit</a> that may only last 10 million years or so.  </p>

<p>Our Moon, however, even though it's slowly moving away from Earth, is sufficiently stable that it will outlast our sun.  It's stable on the scale of many billions of years.  </p>

<p>As to your question ""prolong an orbit via moon power"", The moon tends to destabilize, not stabilize orbits around the Earth.</p>

<p>But while L1 and L2 points aren't gravitationally stable, they are still useful places for satellites because they require less adjustment.   Satalites with orbits that move around lagrange points are often used as useful locations.</p>

<p>Take this bizar orbit around the Moon, where the NASA satellite transfers from L2 to L1 and could, in theory, be transferred back and forth without expending too much energy.  This isn't a ""stable"" orbit by any means but it's an example of an unstable but useful orbit for the life of a satellite.</p>

<p>The James Webb Telescope, when it's launched will orbit around Earth's L2 Lagrange point, which isn't stable, but it requires relatively small adjustments to stay in that order.  It's also useful because it will be nearly entirely shaded from the sun by the Earth and it works best in cold space, away from sunlight.</p>

","<p>No complete answer from me, but some obvious examples of ""hair"" on a neutron star are:</p>

<p>The temperature - both internal and surface temperature can be measured (in principle). These are mainly a function of the age of the neutron star.</p>

<p>The magnetic field - young neutron stars have very strong magnetic fields that are probably an inherited property from the composition and rotation of the progenitor. The field decays with time.</p>

<p>The surface composition may vary from neutron star to neutron star. In principle this can be measured with X-ray spectroscopy. The composition may be connected with the progenitor, but could also reflect accreted material.</p>

<p>Neutron stars have a radius! The radius may or may not be a unique function of mass. It could depend on the rotation, composition and age.</p>

<p>I think though, the gist of your question is could one determine the progenitor of a neutron star from observations of the neutron star? At present the answer to that is no.

"How do moons get captured?","729","","<p>A moon-sized object is running loose in the Solar System, perhaps after a planetary collision.  As it approaches a planet, it's presumably following an approximately hyperbolic path.  If it goes on past, it's still on the same hyperbola, on a curve mirroring its approach (presumably).  How can the planet ever capture it, whatever the body's velocity?  Why doesn't it either collide or go on past?</p>
","<p><strong>How can a planet capture a moon?</strong></p>

<p>There are 178 moons in the Solar System, according to the <a href=""http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NASA Planetary Fact Sheet</a>, so it <em>seems</em> to be a common event. The following sections will show that moon capture is actually unlikely, but when a planet has one or more moons capture becomes easier.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Conditions</strong></p>

<p>Starting from the initial conditions, the planet is in orbit about the sun, and an asteroid is in a different orbit about the sun.</p>

<p>In order for capture to become possible, the asteroid and the planet must come into proximity. When the asteroid comes inside the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence_%28astrodynamics%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sphere of influence</a> of the planet, the gravity of the planet is the main factor in determining the path of the asteroid.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Outcomes</strong></p>

<p>Relative to the planet, the asteroid will be following a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hyperbolic trajectory</a>, and hence has sufficient kinetic energy to avoid capture. A large variety of outcomes may occur, but the ones that lead to capture are those where the asteroid somehow loses enough kinetic energy for its velocity to fall below the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">escape velocity</a> of the planet while retaining enough energy to achieve a closed (elliptical) orbit. The main (not the only) possible outcomes are</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the orbit of the asteroid is perturbed, by a greater or lesser extent, and it continues on its way out of the sphere of influence of the planet.</p></li>
<li><p>the orbit of the asteroid is perturbed, and the asteroid impacts the planet surface. That would usually be the end of the process, but current theories on how Earth captured the Moon are that a body named <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_%28planet%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thea impacted the Earth</a>, and the Moon formed from some of the collision debris.</p></li>
<li><p>the orbit of the asteroid is perturbed, and the path of the asteroid intersects the atmosphere of the planet, losing kinetic energy as heat in the atmosphere (similar to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobraking"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aerobraking</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>the orbit of the asteroid nears an existing moon of the planet and is accelerated (in the sense that deceleration is just acceleration with the opposite sign) by the existing moon, as used by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist#MESSENGER"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MESSENGER spacecraft to slow its speed</a> before orbiting Mercury. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The last two cases admit the <em>possibility</em> of capture. </p>

<p><strong>Possible Capture</strong></p>

<p>After losing energy in the planetary atmosphere, if the asteroid has lost enough energy it may enter a closed orbit around the planet. The problem is that the orbit will intersect the atmosphere again, losing energy each time it does so, until it impacts on the planetary surface. Capture can occur when an existing moon is present and is in just the right place for its gravity to reduce the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eccentricity</a> of the orbit of the asteroid. </p>

<p>So, the most likely case where a planet can capture a free asteroid is when there is already one or more moons present. The incoming asteroid must avoid entering the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hill sphere</a> of the existing moon - the region where the moon would dominate the path of the asteroid.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gravity assist</a> can accelerate an asteroid when the asteroid is passing outside the orbit of the moon, but can decelerate the asteroid is passing <em>inside</em> the orbit of the moon. In this case some of the kinetic energy of the asteroid is transferred to the moon. As is the case with aerobraking capture, gravity assisted capture requires the existing moon to be in just the right place.</p>

<p><strong>Another mechanism</strong></p>

<p>A rather elegant paper published in Nature (mentioned below) shows how <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7090/fig_tab/nature04792_F1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">two bodies orbiting each other</a> as they approach the planet could have led to one being captured by Neptune. This mechanism could apply in other cases also. This <a href=""http://www.astro.umd.edu/people/Theses/2010Philpott.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dissertation</a> (pdf) discusses a similar process for Jupiter.</p>

<p><strong>Irregular bodies</strong></p>

<p>It turns out that irregular shaped bodies can be captured more easily than spherical bodies. Orbiting within the Hill sphere of the planet is not enough for capture to be permanent. Only orbits in the lower half of the Hill sphere are stable. Bodies in higher orbits can be perturbed by nearby planets, and the body can eventually be ejected. But irregular shaped bodies exert minute fluctuations in gravitational attraction on the planet, and actually orbit in a chaotic manor. When other moons or rings are present these chaotic orbits gradually transfer energy to the bodies in the lower orbits, causing the new body to orbit lower, and hence become immune to external perturbation. [citation needed]</p>

<p><strong>Prograde vs retrograde orbits</strong></p>

<p>The same analysis of chaotic orbits, and <a href=""https://www.astro.umd.edu/~dphamil/research/reprints/HamKriv97.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">earlier work</a> also concluded that retrograde orbits are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_and_prograde_motion#Moons_and_rings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more stable than prograde orbits</a>. Whereas prograde orbits are only stable in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere#True_region_of_stability"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inner half</a> of the Hill sphere, retrograde orbits can be stable out to <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/136586"">100% of the Hill radius</a>. Hence retrograde capture is more commonly observed (this is not the whole story, it is still a matter if research).</p>

<p><strong>Multiple existing moons, rings, and the early Solar System</strong></p>

<p>While the probability of a single moon being in the right place at the right time is low, when there are multiple moons the probability of an initial helpful interaction rises linearly. But the probability of additional interactions rises geometrically, so the more moons a planet has the more likely it is to capture more. The existence of rings also aids capture by exerting a drag on the new moon, taking it's energy and lowering it's orbit, in much the same way that uncaptured gas would do in the early Solar System.</p>

<p><strong>The biggest planets have the most moons</strong></p>

<p>It may be obvious, but the biggest planets have the most moons. This is because they have deeper gravity wells, and sweep in more objects. Even though the probability of capture is low (most objects are just pulled into the planet), a steady trickle have have captured over millions of orbits. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Each capture mechanism requires a fortuitous set of conditions, and so is actually a quite rare event. One mechanism is a that a pair of co-orbiting asteroids become separated when one enters the planetary Hill sphere. The odds for an individual asteroid are improved when the asteroid arrives with low kinetic energy that must be given up to other bodies orbiting the planet, and when there are already many moons or a ring system.</p>

"Which stars did the Sun form with?","729","","<p>The Sun formed 4.5 billion years ago, in a molecular cloud. I assume that there were other stars in the vicinity (as is common in molecular clouds). Which stars are they? Where are they now? Are they similar to the Sun?</p>
","<p>Most stars form in clusters, so it is very likely that the Sun was part of a star cluster when it formed. </p>

<p>But in <a href=""http://vambartsumian.org/lib/pdf/dynamics_of_open_clusters.pdf"">On the Dynamics of is Open Clusters</a>, the relaxation time of a cluster is calculated to be in the order of $\tau=4\times10^7 \textrm{yr}$. During that time about one hundredth of the stars will escape from the cluster (i.e. reach escape velocity). The dissipation time of a star cluster is. therefore, in the order of a few billion years. These figures were calculated for an idealised star cluster containing stars of equal mass. For more realistic clusters the dissipation time may be much shorter. Especially dwarf stars seem to dissipate faster.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, likely that after 4.5 billion years, the Sun has escaped from its star cluster. It would be very difficult to identify the stars with which it was formed, unless you can trace back the position of the Sun and other stars before dissipation, which is impracticable.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware, no sibling stars have been positively identified. The sibling stars should be similar in composition (element abundances), although they do not have to be solar twins as the masses of these stars may vary widely.</p>

<p>EDIT: @adrianmcmenamin mentions an article in Sky &amp; Telescope, where a sibling has been proposed. This refers to an <a href=""http://arxiv-web3.library.cornell.edu/abs/1405.1723"">article on arXiv by Ramirex et al.</a> in which the element abundances have been analysed of stars that were earlier identified as possible siblings using galactic dynamics (i.e. tracing back the movement of these stars). Of the 30 stars identified as possible solar siblings using dynamical methods, only 2 stars had similar element abundances, which in itself says something about the accuracy of these dynamical methods...</p>

"Why is the Sun's brightness and radius increasing, but not its temperature?","729","","<p>On the Sun's article on Wikipedia, there is an image showing how the Sun's brightness, radius and temperature have changed over time:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iedcp.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iedcp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>For the past (and next) few billion years, I see the luminosity continuously rising, the temperature remaining about the same, and the radius also rising.</p>

<p>This seems bizarre to me. I would imagine that, for luminosity to increase, the temperature would have to increase. And for temperature to increase, the radius would have to <em>decrease</em> (as the core becomes denser, temperatures rise).</p>

<p>So why does it work this way?</p>

<p>PS: I would also appreciate a concrete explanation for why all three decreased at the beginning of the Sun's life, but suddenly began increasing.</p>
","<p>The effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$ of a star, which is presumably what's been plotted, is defined through its relationship with the star's radius $R$ and luminosity $L$ by </p>

<p>$$L=4\pi R^2\sigma T_\mathrm{eff}^4$$</p>

<p>This comes from the assumption that the star radiates like a black body at the photosphere. While this isn't strictly true, it's quite accurate, and regardless, that's how we define the effective temperature. The actual surface temperature will be slightly different but also behave roughly as plotted.</p>

<p>So, even if $T_\mathrm{eff}$ is constant, the star expands if it grows brighter.  Also, you can see that the sensitivity to temperature is steeper than radius, so a moderate change in luminosity can be absorbed by a relatively small change in effective temperature.</p>

<p>While the luminosity is basically determined by the simple behaviour of the nuclear reactions in the core (in terms of temperature and density), the surface properties depend on how energy is being transported near the surface. For radiation, you have to consider what the opacity of the material is, which itself depends on ionization states and whatnot. It's easy enough to see why the luminosity grows (the core gets denser and also hotter, producing energy faster) but the determination of the surface properties is more complicated. For the Sun, it turns out the way shown in the plot after you solve all the equations with the relevant opacities.</p>

<p>Also, as an extreme counterexample to ""brighter means hotter and smaller"", remember that red giants are much brighter but also much cooler!</p>

<p>PS: I'm not sure the source of the data but I would guess the wiggle at the start is because of the star finishing its contraction onto the main sequence.  That is, before the first minimum, energy is being released by gravitational contraction.  After it, the energy from nuclear reactions starts to dominate.</p>

<p>You could do the same, but it will take some extra work. The Mars you see at some time $t$ was emitted from Mars several minutes earlier than that. You need to find the $\Delta t$ such that the distance between Mars at time $t-\Delta t$ and Earth at time $t$ is equal to the speed of light times $\Delta t$. One correction will get you very close, a second will get you even closer.</p>

<p>Another issue is time. JPL uses its own time scale, JPL ephemeris time (T<sub>eph</sub>). This is a relativistic time scale. It differs from Terrestrial Time (TT) by at most a few milliseconds, so for most purposes you can use TT in lieu of T<sub>eph</sub> in your homebrew ephemeris calculator. TT currently differs from UTC by 67.184 seconds, and beginning in July (there's a leap second at the end of June), it will differ from UTC by 68.184 seconds.</p>

","<p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>

<p>Two bodies in orbit around each other will inevitably collide. The reason for this is that the system will give off energy in the form of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave"" rel=""nofollow"">gravitational waves</a>. This effect is commonly cited in binary neutron star systems, where the two stars are isolated and close together.

"How Does a Refractor Telescope Work?","725","","<p>As I understand it, the difference between a reflector and a refractor is that a reflector uses mirrors on the back to reflect the light to the secondary mirror then the secondary mirror reflects the light to your eye focusing the image with each reflection. How then does a refractor use a lens to sharpen the image? Does it just sharpen the image and shoot it to the prism at the back, and into your eye?</p>
","<p>All telescopes have in common that they gather and focus light from far away objects. They use a primary opical element, such as a concave mirror or a (planar- or bi-)convex lense (or lense system), and they use an eyepiece with another lense system (for viewing) or a camera in their primary focus.</p>

<p>A refractor telescope does not <em>sharpen</em> the image per se. The convex lense concentrates the light rays, not unlike a magnifying glass. To actually focus the enlarged image on your retina, you need an eyepiece, which is another bi-convex lense (in its most simple form). This will re-align the light rays after they passed through the primary focus. See this image for a visual explanation:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/crzqE.png"" alt=""Light ray sketch for a refracting telescope"">
Source: <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Telescope-schematic-A.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>The above image also explains why the image of a refracting telescope appears upside down. You don't need (or want!) any prisms in this kind of setup. </p>

<p>On the other hand, a reflector telescope uses a concave mirror plus an eyepiece. There are different configurations, but one of the most simple and most common ones is the Newtonian telescope:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eC2Db.png"" alt=""Newton telescope ray diagram"">
Source: <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Newtontelescope.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>So instead of refraction of light by a lense, we use the reflection of light on a mirror, to enlarge the image. Focusing on the retina is again done by an eyepiece in the same way as with the refracting telescope.</p>

<p>The advantage of refracting telescopes is that there is no obstruction in the optical path inside the telescope. This is not the case with reflector telescopes. They usually have a secondary mirror in the middle of the optical paths, hence reducing light gathering performance. </p>

<p>On the other hand, reflector telescopes are often much lighter, and cheaper to assemble. Also, very compact models of reflector telescopes can be built. </p>

<p>Also, simple refractor telescopes will produce colourful fringes on object edges, called chromatic abberation, which is due to the glass used in the lenses. This can be compensated by multiple lenses, but this will make the refractor even heavier and more expensive.</p>

"Could light be dark matter?","722","","<p>Is it possible that light itself is dark matter?  I am speaking of photons (e.g. visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc...).  I realize light is understood to be massless, but it is obvious it at least contains energy because we can see with it (e.g. it energizes the cells in our retinas).  I wonder if light has a very tiny ""net mass"" (e.g. 0 mass * relativistically infinite speed).  I would think that light at least has a little mass, in proportion to its energy.  For example, take E=mc^2, then m = E/c^2 would describe how much mass it has.  If this is true, light should have a very little gravity too.  Although the effect would seem minimal, light is practically everywhere. Gravity from light would be more concentrated inside galaxies, and even more concentrated in the center of galaxies where there are many stars (like dark matter is).  It would be interesting to run the calculations, assuming light does have gravity, and see if this matches the gravitational observations of dark matter in the universe.  It would be funny and ironic if dark matter really is light.</p>

<p>Edit: Note that it appears light does have gravity as per the discussions here: <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/1333/how-does-light-affect-the-universe?rq=1"">How does light affect the universe?</a>  If that much is true, I wonder if this is significant enough to account for dark matter?</p>

Therefore, Earth should orbit the sun in a circular orbit. So, my question is, why does the Earth orbits the sun in an Elliptical orbit?  </p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>According to wikipedia and other sources, a planet and a star always move in a circular orbit around the common center of mass of the both bodies ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not true. In the absence of other gravitational sources, a planet and a star move in elliptical orbits about the common center of mass. Ancient scientists assumed circular orbits, but only because circles were somehow most pure. There were problems with this: It didn't match what those ancient scientists saw. So they modified these circular orbits by tacking on other circles. It was a mess.</p>

<p>Kepler cleaned this mess up by noting that the orbits of the planets are very close to elliptical rather than circular. This empirical result was later strengthened by Newton, who derived that elliptical orbits (not circular orbits) are a natural consequence of a force that follows an inverse square law. Gravitation is such a force.</p>

<p>The orbits of the planets about the solar system are not quite elliptical because planets are attracted to one another as well as to the Sun. Nonetheless, the orbits are still very close to elliptical. The Sun is more than 1000 times more massive than Jupiter. Jupiter, Saturn, and the other planets represent tiny perturbations on the nearly elliptical orbits of the planets about the Sun.</p>

<p>What about other perturbing effects, such as nearby stars and the Milky Way as a whole? These are immeasurably small. A passing star will perturb planetary orbits over the course of the tens of millions of years or more. The Milky Way as a whole has essentially no effect whatsoever. Theoretically, the effect most certainly does exist, but it is so small that it can be ignored, even over the lifespan of the solar system.</p>

The article also says that the hydrogen can act as a conductor, is this somehow related to moving electric fields forming magnetic fields? </p>

","<p>In a time, the word ""standard"" normally means the civil time, recognized by the government in the place of interest. I'm not sure about other countries, but in general conversation in the USA, ""standard"" also means that daylight saving time is not in effect. ""Daylight"" time (as in ""Eastern Daylight Time"") means the civil time, recognized by the government, and daylight saving time is in effect.</p>

<p>These can be expressed in the ISO 8601 format; the standard gives the example ""15:27:46+01:00"" meaning the time zone is one hour ahead of (east of) Greenwich.</p>

<p>In astronomy, time can also be the local time of the observer, ignoring the existence of time zones. This is local mean time, and is obtained from Universal Time by adjusting for the longitude of the observer. Usually the exact form of Universal Time that would be used would be UT1.</p>

"Can an asteroid have rings?","713","","<p>I know an asteroid can have moons, but how about rings? Does it also get affected by the Roche limit?</p>

<p>The asteroid Florence has two moons. </p>
","<p>The simple answer is yes, an asteroid can have rings. The current known example is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10199_Chariklo"" rel=""noreferrer"">10199 Chariklo</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Chariklo"" rel=""noreferrer"">whose rings</a> were discovered in 2014 (see <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Natur.508...72B"" rel=""noreferrer"">Braga-Ribas et al. (2014)</a>). It actually has two rings, at distances of 391 km and 405 km, 7 km and 3km in width. As the discovery paper notes, they may be the (young) remnants of a debris disk around Chariklo, and have some moderately-sized bodies embedded in them. The observations indicated that water ice is likely present. Another small body, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060_Chiron"" rel=""noreferrer"">2060 Chiron</a>, may also have rings (see <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05911"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ortiz et al. (2015)</a>). Again, water ice is thought to be a major component of the putative rings.</p>

<p>Both ring systems were hypothesized in part due to evidence from <a href=""http://occult.mit.edu/research/stellarOccultations.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">stellar occultations</a>, i.e. cases where the minor body passed in front of a star. Stellar occultations have proved useful in many cases involving small bodies, such as Kuiper Belt Objects.</p>

<p>As Ortiz et al. noted, Chariklo and Chiron are the two most massive members of a class of minor planets called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(minor_planet)"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>centaurs</em></a>. They orbit (unstable) in between the giant planets of the Solar System. Insights into ring formation around centaurs could perhaps provide information about centaur formation and evolution. It seems likely that the rings form from either</p>

<ul>
<li>The impact of a smaller body on the surface of the centaur</li>
<li>The breakup of a satellite orbiting the centaur (as it crosses the Roche limit, as you speculated)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, rings have <em>not</em> been observed around Trans-Neptunian Objects in similar stellar occultation data, leading the authors to hypothesize that centaurs are a separate population. More observations could shed some light on this hypothesis.</p>

<p>A final interesting point I'd like to make is that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor-planet_moon"" rel=""noreferrer"">many moons around minor planets</a> have been found, but only one or two ring systems are known.</p>

But Hubble was able to resolve the nearby galaxies like the Andromeda nebula into individual stars. By measuring the brightness of so-called Cepheid variable stars, he was able to calculate the distance to the Andromeda galaxy. Here one uses the fact that the total power radiated by the star is related to the period of the brightness oscillations, so by observing such stars you can deduce the distance to these stars and hence the distance to the galaxy. But later it was found that there were two different types of Cepheid stars and the wrong relation had been used; the distances were actually about twice as large.</p>

"Why can i see the dark side of the moon?","708","","<p>Last weekend (29./30. April) the sky in my area (central europe) was pretty clear and the moon was nicely visible. Funnily, one could not only see the sunlit area of the moon, but also the dark side (*) could be easily recognised throughout the whole evening from blue hour until dark night. I attached two photos of the moon that should illustrate the effect. The pictures (sorry for the poor quality) needed to get a little overexposed to capture the illuminated dark side, but with plain eye the effect could be well seen.
We were speculating about the reasons why the non-sunlit area of the moon could be seen.</p>

<ul>
<li>diffraction of sunlight through the atmosphere can be neglected as the moon doesn't have an atmosphere</li>
<li>reflection of light that in turn was reflected from earth (sun -> earth -> moon -> observer) sounded a little unlikely to me</li>
<li>a psychological effect that kind of mentally completes the shape of the moon, because we know it should be circular, sounded ok to me. But could be debunked as the dark side stays visible if one covers the bright side on the photo.</li>
</ul>

<p>So i guess the sun light has to reach the dark side of the moon somehow differently.</p>

"Time according to the gravity of Sagittarius A?","703","","<p>This may be a really dumb question (I'm more of a Biologist than an Astronomer) so I apologize in advance for my little knowledge pertaining to Astronomy, but, if I'm not mistaken, time is effected by gravity, right? So what is Sagittarius A's time compared to ours since it has so much stronger gravity? Do we know specifically the difference?</p>
","<p>Not at all a dumb question. As you have heard, it is true that time is affected by gravity. The stronger the gravitational field, the slower time passes. If you're far from any gravitating matter, time passes ""normally"".</p>

<p>But to answer your question, we must specify what is meant by ""the black holes's time"" (let's call the black hole $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$; see note below on the nomenclature), since it depends on how far from Sgr A* we are talking. The time pace at a distance $r$ from the center of a BH is given by
$$t = t_\infty \sqrt{1 - \frac{r_\mathrm{S}}{r}},$$
where $t_\infty$ is the time ""at infinity"", i.e. far from the BH, and
$$r_\mathrm{S} \equiv \frac{2GM}{c^2} \simeq 3\,\mathrm{km}\,\times \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)$$
is the so-called Schwarzschild radius (the ""surface"" of the BH), which is where not even light can escape. Here, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the BH, $c$ is the speed of light, and $M_\odot$ is the mass of the Sun.</p>

<p>The last equality shows that a BH with the mass of the Sun would have a radius of 3 km. The mass of $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$ is some 4.1 million Solar masses, so its radius is $r_\mathrm{S} = 12.4$ million km.</p>

<p>Plugging in the other numbers, we can see that at a distance from $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$ of</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>1 lightyear</strong>, time runs slower by a factor of 1.0000006557, i.e. unnoticeably.</li>
<li><strong>1 astronomical unit</strong> (the distance from Earth to the Sun), time runs 17% slower.</li>
<li><strong>1 million km from the surface</strong>, time runs slower by a factor of 3.7.</li>
<li><strong>1000 km from the surface</strong>, time runs slower by a factor of 111.</li>
<li><strong>1 km from the surface</strong>, time runs slower by a factor of ~3500.</li>
<li><strong>1 m from the surface</strong>, time runs more than a million times slower.</li>
<li><strong>At the surface</strong>, time stops.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that this time dilation is <em>what a distant observer</em> (i.e. the guy with the $t_\infty$ time) would measure for an observer at the distance $r$. The person at $r$ would just measure his/her own time as usual. For instance, according to point 5 above, if you were hovering 1 km from the surface, waving your hand every second, then I, choosing to stay at a safe distance of 1 lightyear but with a magically powerful telescope, would see you wave approximately once every hour. And when you run out of fuel and plummet into the BH, then when you cross the surface you wouldn't notice anything particular, but I would see you frozen in time. This is the concept of relativity.</p>

<p>Finally, let me use this chance to clarify something that people, including myself, often have gotten wrong: <strong>Sagittarius A</strong> (without an asterisk) is a radio source in the center of the Milky Way. It consists of three parts: <strong>Sagittarius A East</strong> (a supernova remnant), <strong>Sagittarius A West</strong> (dust and gas clouds), and <strong>Sagittarius A*</strong>, or <strong>Sgr A*</strong>, which is a very bright and compact radio source believed to be formed by a supermassive BH. Sgr A* isn't actually the BH <em>itself</em>. I think the BH doesn't really have a name, so I'll call it $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$. Maybe that's a bad name…</p>

"How is the diameter of a gas giant calculated?","701","","<p>As we know atmospheres of celestial bodies don't just stop at a given distance. They gradually become less dense as you move away from the center. </p>

<p>I understand that the diameter of stars is typically given to be that of their photosphere (i.e. the boundary where a laser shined from behind the star toward an observer would just barely be visable). </p>

<p>I assumed that a similar method using optical depth also applied to gas giants. However wikipedia currently has the somewhat confusing explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As Jupiter has no surface, the base of its atmosphere is usually
  considered to be the point at which atmospheric pressure is equal to 1
  MPa (10 bar), or ten times surface pressure on Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which isn't quite the same thing as diameter, but it got me thinking: When wikipedia or a textbook or whatever lists a diameter for a gas giant how is that figure arrived at?</p>
","<p>I won't argue with the wikipedia definition (although the <a href=""http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/jupiterfact.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NASA Jupiter fact sheet</a> lists it as the radius at 1 bar), but just to point out that the scale height of the atmosphere of Jupiter is given by, $h \sim kT/m g$, where $T$ is the temperature, $m$ is the mean molecular mass and $g$ is local gravity. Putting in some numbers: $ g \simeq 24.8 m/s^2$, $m \simeq 2.2 m_u$, $T \simeq 165K$, gives $h \simeq 25\ km$. Thus the pressure changes extremely rapidly compared with the actual radius of a gas giant,and is very small compared to the difference for instance between the polar and equatorial radius for a gas giant (like Jupiter) with significant rotation.</p>

<p>So, whether you give a planet's radius at 1 bar or 10 bar isn't going to make a lot of difference $&lt;100\ km$.</p>

<p>However your comment about whether the definition is analogous to the photosphere of a star does raise an interesting question. The effective opacity radius of a gas giant can vary with the wavelength of light. It is this property that can be used in conjunction with transiting exoplanetary systems to learn something about their atmospheres. For instance, it requires less physical depth of a gas to block wavelengths corresponding to the strong 589nm sodium doublet and thus the exoplanet is opaque at larger radii at this wavelength and thus has a (slightly) deeper transit. This provides the opportunity for transit transmission spectroscopy. e.g. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.426.1663S"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.426.1663S</a></p>

<p>Another example is that at UV and X-ray wavelengths there have been observations suggesting that hot Jupiters have very extended (and opaque to high energy photons) atmospheres and may be being photoevaporated. e.g. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...773...62P"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...773...62P</a></p>

<p>EDIT: So this raises an important distinction. A definition based on the radius at a particular pressure is mostly used by theorists and solar system scientists. However, we still don't know what the atmospheric structures of exoplanets are and can't measure pressures. The radii quoted for exolanets are more akin to how the radius of a star is measured - based on its opacity at the wavelengths being observed. </p>

"If oxygen were pumped into space where would it go?","700","","<p>If an astronaut went into space with a sealed container of oxygen and opened it up in space and let all the oxygen go, what would happen to it? would it all just dissipate into some other particle or matter or would it just stay there until something consumed it</p>
","<p>Gases tries to occupy all the volume of the container in which they are encased in equilibrated pressure. This happens because the gas molecules are always colliding and kicking each other in a 3D high velocity brownian motion. The result is that the gas molecules occupies all the container's volume homogeneously.</p>

<p>So, if the sealed container is opened up in space, the oxygen would quickly leak out, because the molecules near the vacuum edge would be instantaneosuly kicked out by the gas innermost molecules. This would happen rather quickly and in a chained manner, but is dependent on the size of the open hole. Macroscopically, the result would be that all the gas would be running out in a form of a wind/jet out of the open hole into outer space. This would only stop when all the molecules becomes too far apart from each other to have any further intermolecular interaction.</p>

<p>This means that the oxygen (or any other gas) would be dissipated into outer space. The gas molecules would initially be spread out by the intermolecular collisions and then would go outwardly due to the momentum acquired from each individual gas molecule.</p>

<p>When freed in outer space, each molecule would eventually reach something else to interact, so they could be attracted and retained by some gravity well (most likely from a planet or moon), or interact with some magnetosphere (if near a planet) or interact with some other molecule wandering around, or with a cosmic ray or be catched by the solar wind particles (or any of the equivalent if this happens near some other star).</p>

<p>If this happens in intergalactic space where there is no body with appreciable gravity or magnetic field nearby, no stellar wind and the cosmic rays are very sparse and rare and the very few that exists are randomly directed, then the molecules would just spread out in virtually linear trajectories and travel the intergalactic space lonely, quietly and virtually undisturbed for some billions or trillions of years. In their journey, each molecule would only very occasionally interact with some other molecule (likely to be hydrogen) or some other lost particle wandering around.</p>

"Why does the moon sometimes appear giant and a orange red color near the horizon?","697","","<p>I've read various ideas about why the moon looks larger on the horizon.

<p>But every once in a while, the moon looks absolutely huge and has a orange red color to it. Booth the size and color diminish as it moves further above the horizon. This does not seem to fit in with the regular perceived size changes that I already mentioned.</p>

If you think about it, sunlight or moonlight must travel through the maximum amount of atmosphere to get to your eyes when the Sun or Moon is on the horizon (remember that that atmosphere is a sphere around the Earth). So, you expect <em>more</em> blue light to be scattered from Sunlight or Moonlight when the Sun or Moon is on the horizon than when it is, say, overhead; this makes the object look redder.</p>

<p>As to the size, that is commonly referred to as the ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion"" rel=""noreferrer"">Moon Illusion</a>"", which may be a combination of many factors.  The most common explanation is that the frame of reference just tricks our brains.  Also, if you look straight up, the perceived distance is much smaller to our brains than the distance to the horizon.  We don't perceive the sky to be a hemispherical bowl over us, but rather a much more shallow bowl.

","<p>Here's how my non-scientist mind envisions it. I draw a straight line between the two LIGO sites on a map. Then I take another straight line (like a straight edge/ruler) that represents the GW coming in.  If the GW line is coming from the south exactly parallel with the line I drew on the map, then both sites would detect the ""chirp"" at exactly the same time (0 milliseconds difference). If the GW line comes from the south exactly perpendicular to my drawn line, hitting the LA site first, then chirp would be detected at each site at approx 10 milliseconds (?) apart (assuming that's how long it takes for light to travel between the two sites in a straight line).</p>

<p>So I envision the GW ""line"" came in from the south somewhere between parallel and perpendicular (closer to perpendicular) in relation to my drawn line. Someone else smarter than I can figure out the maths and correct angles, numbers, etc.</p>

I also read about the collision of particles in the gas cloud causing the overall spin to be in just one direction. But what decides the direction in which the accretion disk spins relative to the direction of the core?
<br>
(I'm thinking that it might be because of some primary conditions - maybe the direction in which the core is spinning.)</p>
","<p>Stellar systems are born from clouds of turbulent gas. Although ""turbulence"" means that different parcels of gas move in different directions, the cloud have some overall, net angular momentum. Usually a cloud gives birth to multiple stellar systems, but even the subregion forming a given system has a net, and non-vanishing (i.e. $\ne0$), angular momentum.</p>

<p>Parcels moving in opposite directions will collide, and friction will cause the gas to lose energy, such that the cloud contracts. Eventually subclouds moving in one direction will ""win over"" subclouds moving in other directions such that everything moves in the same direction, keeping the original angular momentum (minus what is ejected e.g. through jets).</p>

<p>This means that the central star will rotate in the same direction as the circumstellar disk and that, in general, the planets that form subsequently, will also not only orbit the star in the same direction, but also spin in the same direction around their own axes. This is called <em>prograde rotation</em>. Sometimes, however, collisions between bodies may cause a planet or asteroid to spin in the opposite direction. This is called <em>retrograde rotation</em> and is the case for Venus and Uranus.</p>

"What is the evidence that galaxies rotate?","692","","<p>Do all galaxies rotate?  If so, do they rotate in the same direction?</p>

<p>What observations have been made of galaxy rotation?</p>
","<p><strong>Rotation:</strong></p>

<p>One of the easiest way to show that galaxies rotates are Doppler observations of atomic or molecular lines. For example, if the observed galaxy is seen edge-on and rotates clockwise, the left side of the galaxy is going away from you, and is then Doppler-shifted in the red. The right side, going toward you, is Doppler-shifted in the blue.</p>

<p><a href=""http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1965SvA.....8..823A/0000823.000.html"">This kind of observations</a> was realized already in the '60, in radio.</p>

<p>The spiral patern observed in spiral galaxies is also a clear signature of their rotation. Note that spiral are linked to density waves in the galactic disk (see for example <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1964ApJ...140..646L"">Lin &amp; Shu 1964</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong></p>

<p>As for their directions, you can convinced yourself that there is no tendency, just looking at <a href=""http://hubblesite.org/gallery/album/galaxy/"">this Hubble telescope gallery</a>. You can also think that galaxies probably rotate by angular momentum conservation during their formation history, and that it highly dependent on initial conditions, that are clearly random.</p>

"Aren't there more naked-eye-visible stars in the Milky Way plane?","691","","<p>Most stars which are visible to the naked eye are within 1,000 light years. The Sun is inside the Orion arm which has a diameter of about 3,500 light years. Thus, all stars (with very few exceptions) we can see unaided are inside the Orion arm and should be equally distributed in all directions. The structure of the galaxy is too large to affect the distribution of visible stars.</p>

<p>Still, we do see the Milky Way disk. What is it we see? The dim light of stars we can't make out individually? Or star light reflected by gas clouds? And is the density of stars to the unaided eye really not higher in the plane of the Milky Way? (Since I'm living in a light polluted city I can't easily check it out myself)</p>
","<p>You can tell a lot about Galactic structure by just looking. The ~5000 stars that can be seen with the naked eye have a roughly ""lognormal"" distribution of distance. I show plots below which were generated from the most recent version of the Hipparcos parallax catalogue. Fig.1 shows results for all stars with $5.5&lt;V&lt;6.5$  (i.e. very faint naked eye stars). The Hipparcos catalogue is almost complete for these stars, though some stars are so far away that the distance is highly uncertain - nevertheless, the general picture should be ok.</p>

<p>The median distance is about 440 light years. But the premise of your question is I think, that you dispute that this is far enough for the non-spherical distribution of stars in our Galaxy to become apparent. The answer is actually that it is, but only just. The Sun is very close to the plane of the disk of our Galaxy. The scale height of stars above this disk varies depending on stellar age and mass. Very approximately, the exponential scale height is 300-500 light years for most of the stars in our Galaxy.</p>

<p>This is just small enough that if we look at the demographics of stars in two Galactic latitude regions we <em>do</em> see a difference. Fig. 2 below shows stars with $5.5&lt;V&lt;6.5$ at low Galactic latitudes (within 15 degrees of the plane in green) and more than 45 degrees from the plane (in blue). There is a clear and significant difference. More stars can be seen at greater distances towards the plane, betraying the non spherically-symmetric nature of stars in our Galaxy.</p>

<p>In other words the structure of the Galaxy <em>is not</em> too small to affect the distribution of naked eye stars. </p>

<p>When we look at the Milky Way we are seeing millions of unresolved stars that are in general more distant still. The effects of the disk-like nature of the Galaxy become more apparent as one goes to greater distances. In particular, at high Galactic latitudes one simply runs out of stars and hence there is no uniformly illuminated sky - leading to Olber's paradox, as correctly stated in another answer. But at low latitudes, there are sufficient stars that in general, within the resolution of our eyes there are many stars whose light sums to provide a visual stimulus. This picture is interrupted by <em>dust</em>. Dust in the Galaxy is even more concentrated towards the plane than the stars. It is for this reason that beyond a few thousand light years, dust plays a major role in shaping the Milky Way structures that we can see, effectively blocking light at very low Galactic latitudes.</p>

<p><em>Fig 2: Probability distribution of distance for naked eye stars divided into low and high Galactic latitude regions (i.e. towards and away from the Galactic plane)</em>.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT EDIT:</p>

<p>After the answer was accepted I did a bit of double checking. I split the Hipparcos sample into bright ($V&lt;6$, 5000 stars) and very bright ($V&lt;3$, 173 stars) and looked at the distribution of stars per unit area on the sky as a function of Galactic latitude (Fig. 3). The results are shown below and more obviously make the point. It turns out that the asymmetry between in an out of the plane is clearly seen, even in the brighter sample. The reason is that the very bright stars are not <em>all that much</em> closer than the bright stars. Perhaps a median of 200 light years vs 350 light years. Thus the scale height of the Galactic disc must be small enough that the difference from spherical symmetry is already appearent at these kinds of distances.</p>

<p>FURTHER EDIT: You can even see from the plot above that there is also a slight concentration towards negative latitudes; the peak density is around -5 to -10 degrees in both cases. This is likely because the Sun is above the Galactic plane at present (though I also wonder if dust plays a role). The Sun is currently 60 light years above the plane and heading upwards (see <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/822/how-far-is-the-earth-sun-above-below-the-galactic-plane-and-is-it-heading-towar"">How far is the Earth/Sun above/below the galactic plane, and is it heading toward/away from it?</a> ).

<p>We think of a gas as something very . . . well, airy. After all, air is the gas we all know and love. We breathe it and fly planes right through it with no trouble. So it makes sense to think that a gas planet must be like a big, airy cloud floating out in space.
Saturn in true color.</p>

<p>The bigger a planet becomes, the heavier is the material weighing down on its center. Think of how it feels to dive under water. If you are wearing a face mask, you notice that as you dive deeper, the mask presses harder and harder on your face. Also, your ears start feeling the pressure even at 2 or 3 meters (5 or 10 feet) below the surface. The pressure you feel on your body is due to the weight of the water above you. The deeper you go, the heavier the water above you and so the greater the pressure on your body. Even on Earth's surface, each square inch of your body experiences 14.7 pounds of pressure due to the weight of the atmosphere above you. If you could dive down to the center of Earth, the pressure on your body would be about 3.5 million times as great! The center of Jupiter is more than 11 times deeper than Earth's center and the pressure may be 50 million to 100 million times that on Earth's surface!</p>

<p>The tremendous pressure at the center of planets causes the temperatures there to be surprisingly high. At their cores, Jupiter and Saturn are much hotter than the surface of the Sun!</p>

<p>Strange things happen to matter under these extraordinary temperatures and pressures. Hydrogen, along with helium, is the main ingredient of Jupiter's and Saturn's atmospheres. Deep in their atmospheres, the hydrogen turns into a liquid. Deeper still, the liquid hydrogen turns into a metal!</p>

<p>But what's at the very center of these planets? The material becomes stranger and stranger the deeper you go. Scientists do not understand the properties of matter under the extreme environments inside Jupiter and Saturn. Many different forces and laws of nature are at work, and the conditions inside these planets are very difficult to create in a laboratory here on Earth. But you can be sure that you wouldn't be able to fly through these bizarre materials! As we now know, the gas giants are much more than just gas.</p>

<p>I can get pretty decent views of the moon but a very blurry, small view of Jupiter with the 4mm and Barlow.  I can see the color of the storm rings for example, but barely.  I've not had a chance to have a go at Saturn yet.  A view similar to this...</p>

<p>I've been reading up on this and was looking at purchasing a 4-8mm Plössl lens but I'm not sure if the lens is my weak spot or some other aspect of the telescope.
Another thing to note is that I've been using it in a pretty bright street, looking up very close to street lights.  I've not had a chance to take out somewhere with less light pollution.</p>

<p>So what I'm asking is, how much difference would a lens upgrade make, specifically to my image quality?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>...a very blurry, small view of Jupiter with the 4mm and Barlow...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be aware that a 4mm eyepiece <strong>and</strong> a 3x barlow at the same time will give you a very high magnification - too high!  For regular Jupiter viewing I would suggest you stick to 100x or 200x at most, unless the air is exceptionally still. (After a few sessions you'll find out what ""Still"" air means.)</p>

<p>A lot of beginner scopes like this are sold with barlows that tend to give too much power, my advice is to keep it packed away for most sessions.</p>

<p>So I'd stick to using that 4mm on its own, jupiter will look quite small but with practice you can usually tease a bit more detail out of the image.</p>

<p>I don't have one of these scopes, but my experience of comparing cheap modern eyepieces with expensive ones is that the lower cost ones are generally OK these days. 4mm is quite a high power so the extra magnification will cause a lot of blurriness and it will take patience to get the focusing at its sharpest, so don't panic if everything is looking fuzzy at the moment.</p>

<p>For a first stage I would suggest a few things that are nothing to do with the eyepieces at all...</p>

<ul>
<li>Collimation - look this up, it just means adjusting the two mirrors
so your eye is looking right down the tube in a straight line. For a
long focal length scope like yours, it's not likely to be a problem
unless one of them is wildly out of line.</li>
<li>Tube currents/thermal behaviour - on almost any cold night, when
the tube and main mirror are still warm from being indoors, rising
air currents in the tube will mess up your image and make it
shimmery, at high power. Low power will look OK. It might take an hour or so for the image to improve (a guess)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, in summary my guess is changing the eyepieces straight away won't make a dramatic difference. Eyepiece makers will say otherwise of course :)</p>

"During night on the Moon is there Earth light and Earth phases?","686","","<p>I realise that night time on the Moon is two weeks, however I am curious if during the night there, whether or not the Earth reflects light in similar manner to the Moon. </p>

<p>On the one hand, I know it must (as seen in photographs from astronauts), but what I'm really wanting to know is:</p>

<p>Does the Earth have phases like the Moon and do they work in a similar manner for an observer on the Moon?</p>

<p>I assume the Earth isn't as reflective as the Moon since the Moon is much lighter in colour, however the Earth is also fairly larger, does this make any difference in the amount of light reflected?</p>

<p>Finally, if the Earth does appear in phases, does that mean that the two week long nights on the Moon are sometimes pitch black (new Earth) and sometimes less than pitch black (full Earth)?</p>
","<p>From the perspective of the Moon, the Earth exhibits phases just as does the Moon when viewed from the perspective of the Earth. There are however some differences. One difference is that the phase of the Earth at a fixed local lunar time will be pretty much the same from one day to the next. This is a result of the fact that the Moon is tidally locked. Another difference is that earthlight is considerably brighter than moonlight. This is a consequence of the Earth's significantly larger albedo and significantly larger diameter compared to the Moon. A third difference is that except for locations close to ±90° lunar longitude, the Earth doesn't rise and set.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You have this backwards. The Moon is rather dark. It's reflectivity is about that of old asphalt. The Earth is significantly more reflective than is the Moon.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No. This is the first difference between Moon phases and Earth phases. Earth phase on the Moon is a function of lunar longitude and time of lunar day. You won't see a full Earth one night and a new Earth some other night.</p>

"How to test direct sun viewing glasses","686","","<p>I purchased a 10 pack of glasses for viewing the upcoming eclipse. They show to be ISO 12312-2:2015 certified. How can this be tested and verified?</p>
","<p>The American Astronomical Society (AAS) answers this question on their <a href=""https://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/iso-certification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to Tell If Your Eclipse Glasses or Handheld Solar Viewers Are Safe</a> page.</p>

<p>Basically they say that since anyone can claim ISO 12312-2 compliance even if they haven't been certified, you should make sure you obtained your eclipse glasses from a vendor whose ISO 12312-2 compliance has been verified by the AAS Solar Eclipse Task Force:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We used to say that you should look for evidence that they comply with the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard for filters for direct viewing of the Sun. But now the marketplace is being flooded by counterfeit eclipse glasses that are labeled as if they're ISO-compliant when in fact they are not. So now we suggest that you make sure you get (or got) your eclipse viewers from one of the suppliers listed on our <a href=""https://eclipse.aas.org/resources/solar-filters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reputable Vendors of Solar Filters &amp; Viewers</a> page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They say that checking eclipse glasses to see if they meet the ISO 12312-2 standard would require a spectrophotometer, which most people do not have access to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, you can't check whether a filter meets the ISO standard yourself — doing so requires a specialized and expensive piece of laboratory equipment called a spectrophotometer that shines intense UV, visible, and IR light through the filter and measures how much gets through at each wavelength.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they have assembled a task force to put together a list of manufacturers and vendors of eclipse glasses that they have verified to be ISO 12312-2 certified (their list is longer than NASA's list of <a href=""https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/safety"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">5 manufacturers</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The AAS Solar Eclipse Task Force has been working diligently to compile a list of such vendors, now posted on our <a href=""https://eclipse.aas.org/resources/solar-filters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reputable Vendors of Solar Filters &amp; Viewers</a> page. We've checked manufacturers' ISO paperwork to make sure it's complete and that it comes from a recognized, accredited testing facility, and we've personally examined manufacturers' products. We've asked manufacturers to identify their authorized resellers, and we've asked dealers to identify the source of the products they're selling. Only when everything checks out do we add a vendor to our listing. If we don't list a supplier, that doesn't mean their products are unsafe — only that we have no knowledge of them or that we haven't convinced ourselves they are safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also give advice on how to tell if your eclipse glasses are not safe to use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can you tell if your solar viewer is not safe? The only thing you can see through a safe solar filter from a reputable vendor is the Sun itself. If you can see ordinary household lights through your eclipse glasses or handheld viewer, it’s no good. Safe solar filters produce a view of the Sun that is comfortably bright (like the full Moon), in focus, and surrounded by black sky. If you glance at the Sun through your solar filter and find it uncomfortably bright, out of focus, and surrounded by a murky haze, it’s no good.</p>

"Latest sunrise/earliest sunset out of phase with solstice?","684","","<p>Everybody knows that the shortest and longest days of the year occur on the solstices.  However, examination of sunrise/sunset tables shows that the maxima and minima of sunrise/sunset times are offset from the solstices by about 10 days. </p>

<p>This is counterintuitive... what's the explanation?</p>
","<p>The point here is that sunrise and sunset does not only move towards or away from noon, but noon itself moves around 12:00. There is a difference between ""civil time"" (the one counted by wall clocks) and ""solar time"" (the one marked by sun clocks). This difference is called the ""Equation of Time"" and its geometrical shape is called the Analema.</p>

<p>So in order to have the earliest sunset you need a combination of both a short day and a noon moved before 12:00. Same reasoning for latest sunrise.</p>

Days are currently getting longer in the northern hemisphere, but noon is advancing by 20 to 25 seconds per day.

Sunrise advances by half the increase in length of day less that 20 to 25 second advance in noon.</p>

<p>The increase in the length of day (time from sunrise to sunset) depends on latitude. In Bogota Columbia (4°35′53″N latitude), length of day increases by only 3 to 10 seconds per day during January, growing throughout the month. That tiny change in length of day means sunrise continues to advance throughout the month of January in Bogota. On the other hand, in Reykjavík, Iceland (64°08′N latitude), length of day increases drastically from day to day, even at this time of year.

<p>(except for the storm of course)</p>
","<p>I'll give this one a shot. Correction is welcome.  </p>

<p><strong>Upper atmosphere temperature.</strong></p>

<p>It's not just elements that give a planet color, but the temperature of elements. When we examine what a planet looks like, we're basically talking about reflected sunlight from the planet's surface or atmosphere. With Earth, its atmosphere is transparent enough that its surface can be seen from space. However, it is the only planet in the Solar System where that is the case. The other planets have thick atmospheres, so all we see is basically just high altitude clouds. </p>

<p>Also, as I understand it, the pictures of planets are often enhanced to make any distinctions more apparent. So if you actually flew above Jupiter, its lines might not be quite so distinct as the pretty pictures you'll usually find on the web. Regardless, that doesn't change your question; its lines are still far, far more distinct than Saturn's are and Galileo was able to see its Red Spot, so I think it's safe to say its lines are pronounced, even if the pictures we get are doctored a bit.</p>

<p>So anyway, Jupiter is at the right distance from the Sun to undergo atmospheric transition from ice to gas. As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> puts it,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The upper ammonia clouds visible at Jupiter's surface are organized in
  a dozen zonal bands parallel to the equator and are bounded by
  powerful zonal atmospheric flows (winds) known as jets. The bands
  alternate in color: the dark bands are called belts, while light ones
  are called zones. Zones, which are colder than belts, correspond to
  upwellings, while belts mark descending air. The zones' lighter
  color is believed to result from ammonia ice; what gives the belts
  their darker colors is not known with certainty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ammonia ice, like all ice, is very reflective, so the colder bands with ice are lighter. Ammonia gas is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">transparent</a>, but anyone who has ever flown over the ocean knows that if you have enough of a transparent thing (water), it has a distinct color. While the quote from Wikipedia above says the reason for the darker colors is uncertain, less ice in its uppermost atmosphere means less reflected light and darker color.  </p>

<p>Saturn, Neptune and Uranus are far enough away from the Sun where they always have ice in their upper most atmospheres, so they have less variation in color.  Earth's clouds are also primarily ice (not water vapor), so that is basically the answer. Jupiter is the right distance from the Sun for its upper atmosphere to transition and have distinct bands, some with ice, some without.  </p>

<p><strong>""But why are the bands in straight lines?""</strong></p>

<p>This is due to the <a href=""http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/coriolis.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coriolis effect</a>.  Viewed from above, the Coriolis effect creates bands that line up with the equator.  Jupiter and Saturn both rotate quite quickly (9.5 and 10.8 hours respectively), so both have strong Coriolis effects.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uLRbw.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uLRbw.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Jupiter's atmosphere isn't just moving along those visible lines; it's circulating up from the warmer lower parts of the atmosphere to higher parts by convection. This is because there's a lot of heat to be transferred. Jupiter (along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) are all radiating more heat into space than they are receiving from the Sun, so while the heat from the Sun plays a role in not freezing Jupiter's upper atmosphere over warmer bands, it is the Coriolis effect that creates the bands. </p>

<p>Saturn has bands too (as you know). They are not as visible because both the warm bands and cold bands of Saturn are icy. See articles <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7192/fig_tab/nature06897_F1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/2743/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and article with false color picture <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_778.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, crediting Saturn's colors to ammonia ice.</p>

<p>So, for bands to form, all you need is relatively fast rotation. But for highly visible bands, the gas giant planet needs to be the right distance from the Sun and/or have the right amount of internal heat. It's all about the temperature.  </p>

<p>I feel that I have to punctuate this with a ""probably"", because I can't swear that Saturn has ammonia ice all around its upper atmosphere, but I'm pretty sure that is the primary difference between Saturn's more uniform look (Uranus and Neptune too). It is primarily the ammonia that gives these planets their color, even though both Saturn and Jupiter are 99% hydrogen and Helium. Straight gas molecules (O2, N2, H2) and noble gases tend to have very little interaction with visible light.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href=""http://www.exoclimes.com/topics/the-colour-of-giant-planets-in-the-solar-system/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fun article</a> on gas giant planet's color. The science of what gives an atmosphere a specific color, however, is quite complex and above my pay-grade. Also, I also found this <a href=""http://www.teachastronomy.com/astropedia/article/Thermal-Radiation-from-Gas-Giant-Planets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> interesting, though I can't swear to the accuracy of it.  Saturn radiates a surprising amount of heat given that it's 1/3rd the mass of Jupiter. </p>

<p>Lastly, <a href=""http://pds-rings.seti.org/saturn/earthbased/displaysaturn.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> may provide a more accurate but less sexy picture of Saturn than we're used to seeing.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nyFD1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nyFD1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Final note, on Jupiter's dark spots and dark bands. Wikipedia said the reason for the darkness is unknown (as quoted above). While I think the lack of atmospheric ammonia ice is very much a part of the answer, <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/7980/why-jupiters-great-red-spot-is-reddish?rq=1"">here's</a> an alternate explanation for Jupiter's dark red spot and (perhaps) to some extent, its dark bands. Jupiter gets, on average, about 3.4 times the solar radiation per square meter than Saturn gets. To add to that, it might have more extensive atmospheric mixing going on than Saturn and more organic compounds in its upper atmosphere, which, combined with UV rays, could well play a role in Jupiter's darker lines too.</p>

<p>[Using altazimuth telescope...:]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you happen to be observing from the North or South Pole, the vertical axis would be aligned with the Earth's spin axis. The nice thing about that would be that when you found an object to observe, rotation in only the vertical axis would be needed to keep the object in the field of view. Rotating at the Earth's spin rate in the opposite direction as the Earth's rotation would keep and object motionless in the eyepiece.</p>
  
  <p>However, for any other latitude on the planet, the vertical axis is not aligned with the Earth's spin axis. This means that to keep an object in the field of view requires motion in both axes. The motion rates will change over time as the elevation angle changes. Tracking objects near the horizon requires mostly changes in elevation, and tracking objects more straight up requires mostly changes in azimuth.</p>

"How do solar winds affect the atmospheric composition and density of planets?","681","","<p>Here is a bit of a newbie question, if you please. </p>

<p>The sun is constantly ejecting small particles via solar winds that come into contact with planets and other objects in our solar system. Do these particles contribute to the planets's atmospheres? Or do they do more harm than good? (define: good = contribute).</p>

<p>Do solar winds contain any larger atoms than helium. For instance, Oxygen? </p>

<p>My intuition on this issue is mixed since we have Mars with a very thin atmosphere, but Venus with a very thick atmosphere, neither having a very strong magnetosphere to protect them from solar winds.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Do these particles contribute to the planets' atmospheres? Or do they
  do more harm than good? (define: good = contribute).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on the size (mass/escape velocity) of the planet.   See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape"" rel=""noreferrer"">atmospheric escape</a> and pretty picture</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2RADR.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2RADR.png"" alt=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Solar_system_escape_velocity_vs_surface_temperature.svg/512px-Solar_system_escape_velocity_vs_surface_temperature.svg.png""></a></p>

<p>For the 4 inner planets, the solar wind strips gas from the planets.  This process if fairly straight forward.   It has more to do with heat than traditional ""blowing"", and when the when the outer atmosphere gas molecules reach a certain temperature they can achieve escape velocity.   Earth mostly just loses hydrogen and helium and very little of it's heavier gases.   Venus over time has lost most of it's Methane and Water Vapor, the key difference between Earth and Venus is that Earth has a magnetic field.</p>

<p>Mars has lost most of it's atmosphere and what atmosphere Mars retains may be related to the thawing and re-freezing of it's icy poles, and Mercury's atmosphere is so thin that it's atmosphere actually is little more than a loosely retained collection of solar wind particles.</p>

<p>The 4 outer planets don't lose much to the solar wind and the Solar wind (I would think) adds to rather than takes away from their total mass, but this addition is very small compared to the mass of a planet. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do solar winds contain any larger atoms than helium. For instance,
  Oxygen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but only trace amounts.  The Solar wind is 92% hydrogen and 8% helium.  <a href=""http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsolwindcomp.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>.  Very close to the universal average ratio.   Solar particles are so hot that when they're ejected from the sun the electrons and atomic nuclei are largely separated so you get a stream of charged particles, electrons and protons being the most common and Alpha Particles (Helium Nuclei) 3rd.  This means that any planets with a magnetic field, those particles get caught in planet's magnetic field.   That's why a magnetic field is considered very important in preserving a planet's atmosphere.</p>

<p>Some of the captured solar wind particles would probably get deposited into the Planet's atmosphere over time but I'm not clear on that process and I don't know the percentages.  </p>

<p>Getting back to the Sun, it has about 2% ""heavy"" elements in it, see <a href=""http://www.space.com/17170-what-is-the-sun-made-of.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">article</a>, and by ""heavy"" I mean, Oxygen, Carbon, Neon, others, but gravity draws the heavier elements towards the center of the sun.   Also, the helium the sun creates is largely formed near the center of the sun, so the outer parts where the solar wind gets ejected has a more standard/universal balance of about 92% hydrogen by element.</p>

  <p>My intuition on this issue is mixed since we have Mars with a very
  thin atmosphere, but Venus with a very thick atmosphere, neither

<p>Venus mass is sufficient to make a difference.  Atmospheric escape has to do with escape velocity from the planets and Venus' escape velocity is over twice Mars'.   <a href=""http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>.  Venus' atmosphere is also sufficiently thick that it generates it's own magnetic protection of sorts, (I've read that, didn't see a good article to reference just now).   </p>

<p>Jupiter has an enormous magnetic field, which casts a pretty big net, much larger than the planet itself and that captures solar wind particles, but compared to the mass of Jupiter, the captured solar particles, even with the large magnetic net, is teeny-tiny and makes no real difference in the mass of the planet.</p>

<p>Interestingly, when the sun approaches it's red giant stage, it's ejections will significantly increase, so it's possible that, 5 billion or so years from now the sun will feed Jupiter a stream of particles in a measurable way and Jupiter will grow larger and perhaps, visibly glow due to the particles it receives.  Jupiter might be a fun planet to watch when our sun goes red giant, perhaps from the safe distance of a colony on Saturn's moon titan.   But that's just speculation.   :-)   </p>

<p>It will never turn into a star, it's far far far too light for that, but Jupiter could still be fun to watch (from a safe distance) 5 billion years from now.   (My answers always tend to be too long). . . </p>

<p>The binoculars weighs 2.2kg, while the head is rated to a loading capacity of 10kg, and the legs to a tilted loading capacity of 5kg. This means that the tripod should work well, but it doesn't — it vibrates a lot even when my face gently touches the eyepiece, even without the center column extended, so much so that it becomes a pain to use the binoculars.</p>

<p>Am I correct in understanding that:</p>

<li>I need to upgrade my tripod legs.</li>
<li>I don't need to upgrade the head, since it's rated to twice the capacity of the legs, and to twice the weight of the biggest binoculars I'll use.</li>

<p>Seems right to me. However, if you have some money to spare, I think you should consider investing in a Parallelogram Mount (P-mount). These usually look like long arms with counterweights and a place to attach your bino. They make it easier to adjust the height, observe objects close to zenith and are usable from a chair. </p>

<p>I don't have this problem with binoculars as the ones I own are pretty light but with photographic equipment, I try not to exceed half the declared capacity. The better the brand, the closer you can get, I suppose. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I should look for a set of wooden legs, since these have greater stability than aluminium legs while being affordable, unlike carbon fiber.</p>

<p>I've used wooden legs for a small telescope and I wouldn't like to do it again. Unless you're only planning to use a tripod around the house. Wooden tripods are usually heavy, clunky and not very portable.</p>

<p>Carbon fiber tripods, on the other hand, tend to be very light so you'll have to be a little more careful with a big and heavy bino than in case of an aluminium or wooden one. If you get one, make sure it has a hook under the column, on which you can hang something to shift the center of mass closer to the ground.</p>

<p>I once had a carbon tripod almost tip over after a strong gust of wind when I had a large-ish telephoto lens mounted on it. Managed to catch it just in the nick of time.</p>

"Why aren't there galaxy-sized balls of iron out there?","680","","<p>Since we know that stars burn out, collapse, or blow up when too many of their atoms fuse into iron, then how come, with all the ancient galaxies we've been observing, there isn't one galaxy whose stars have become giant balls of iron, which would eventually collide into one galaxy-sized iron globule in space?</p>
","<p>In short, you can't make a galaxy-mass ball of iron because there's no way to support the ball against the inward crush of its own gravity. First, it would collapse into a neutron star, but even neutron stars can't hold themselves up beyond about 2-3 solar masses.  Your galaxy-sized object would collapse into a black hole.  But we do see these!  All massive galaxies are believed to have supermassive black holes at their centres. These are up to 10 billion solar masses in size, which is comparable to smaller galaxies.</p>

<p>In any star, be it a main-sequence star like the Sun, a giant, or even a white dwarf or neutron star, the inward force of gravity must be balanced by some outward force or pressure.  (In fact, we basically assume this when we construct stellar models, although it's a very good assumption.) In main-sequence stars, this pressure is provided by the nuclear reactions happening inside them but as a star evolves, it gets a bit more complicated. In some situations, the nuclei get so close together that they their electrons begin to share quantum states. And because no two electrons can be in the same state, they have to occupy higher energy states. This in effect exerts a kind of pressure (called <em>degeneracy pressure</em>), because the electrons are forced to move around faster than they otherwise would. This is what supports white dwarfs and the cores of some evolved stars. e.g. low-mass red giants.</p>

<p>Degeneracy pressure is fine up to a limit known as the <em>Chandrasekhar limit</em>, which is about 1.44 solar masses (depending on the composition of the object in question). Anything above this would collapse. First, this collapse would yield a neutron star, where things are a bit different. But a similar principle holds, and there's a degeneracy pressure because the neutrons themselves also occupy one quantum state each.  The details are <em>much</em> more difficult here, but the overall consensus is that neutron degeneracy pressure can support objects up to about 2-3 solar masses. After that, there's nothing left to balance gravity, and the star collapses into a black hole.</p>

","<p>OK, it seems to me that what you have is a fits image (from where?) that has some world coordinate system information attached. When you load the 2MASS catalogue, SAOimage is able to use the RA and Dec in the catalogue to calculate the x,y positions of the catalog sources in your image (and marks them as green circles).</p>

<p>Is what you are asking - how do I get the x,y coordinates of these 2MASS sources in my image? Or do you wish to know what the x,y coordinates of the <em>actual sources in your image</em>? If the latter then you will need some other software like Sextractor or DAOphot to do source-searching and parameterisation in your image.</p>

<p>If the former, here's a way of doing it. When you load the catalog you should see a window open entitled ""2MASS Point sources"" which lists all the sources in your image. From the ""File"" dialogue, select ""Copy to regions"". Then, in the main image window open the ""Regions"" dialogue and select ""List regions"". Another dialogue box will open asking you to select the format and coordinate system. From this, select ""x,y"" for the format and ""image"" for the coordinate system. This will give you a list of x,y coordinates.</p>

<p>If you want to match this up with the 2MASS sources then you have to ""list regions"" again, but this time select ""fk5"" as the coordinate system. This will then give you a list of the RA, Dec of the same sources. Use you favourite editor to attach these lists to each other.</p>

<p>Quite probably there is a more elegant solution, but this works.</p>

","<p>Even if you're only referring the ""ordinary"" matter (such as stars, gas, and bicycles) and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter"" rel=""nofollow"">dark matter</a>, the mass of the observable Universe does increase, not because mass is being created, but because the size of the observable Universe increases. In a billion years from now, we can see stuff that today is too far away for the light to have reached us, so its radius has increased. Since the mass $M$ equals density $\rho_\mathrm{M}$ times volume $V$, $M$ increases.</p>

<p>As called2voyage mentions, we have several ways of measuring the density, and we know it's close to $3\times10^{-30}\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The radius is $R = 4.6\times10^{28}\,\mathrm{cm}$, so the mass is
$$M = \rho_\mathrm{M} \frac{4\pi}{3}R^3 \simeq 10^{57}\,\mathrm{g},$$
or $5\times10^{23}M_\odot$ (Solar masses).</p>

<p>However, another factor contributes to the mass increase, namely the so-called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy"" rel=""nofollow"">dark energy</a>, which is a form of energy attributed to empty space. Since the Universe expands, dark energy is being created all the time.</p>

"Why, in the Solar System, all the mass seems to be concentrated at the centre?","677","","<p>Is this a consequence of planet formation in accretion disks ?</p>
","<p>I feel that HDE gives a good start of an answer, but stops short of the important part. We have seen in HDE's answer the formation of a star at the center of the collapsing molecular cloud. When the star begins to fuse lighter elements, the protoplanetary disk has several forces acting on it:</p>

<ul>
<li>The momentum of the particles in the disk.</li>
<li>The gravity of the star in the center and other particles of the protoplanetary disk on the other side.</li>
<li>The gravity of the particles of the protoplanetary disk opposite the sun (outward).</li>
<li>The radiation pressure of the new star.</li>
</ul>

<p>Interestingly, the second and third forces pretty much cancel out when the disk is still uniform in distribution. But once large clumps of matter accumulate those large masses (protoplanets) gravitationally pull at the other matter in inconsistent and sometimes violent ways, especially when multiple protoplanets align (once per orbit of the inner body).</p>

<p>Thus, the area of the protoplanetary disk is being 'swept up' of all the mass: some is <strong>pulled into the sun</strong> by gravity and loss of momentum due to collisions, some is <strong>pushed out of the solar system</strong> by radiation, and whatever matter was not disturbed by one of those processes is then subject to being disturbed by the gravity of the protoplanets themselves. The protoplanets will, over time, either absorb that matter or gravitationally slingshot that matter <strong>out of the system or too it's very edges</strong>.</p>

<p>In short, the protoplanetary disk within a few tens of AU of the star in the center is <strong>a chaotic mess of a place</strong>. Not much matter can form a stable orbit there.</p>

But my question is ""why the distance between the Sun and Earth is Same? Earth should have moved closer to Sun and obviously Earth should fall into the Sun.""</p>

<p>Thanks,
Selva</p>
","<p>While the Sun and Earth attract each other, they cannot fall into each other because of <strong>angular momentum conservation</strong>. In a central field (where the force is acts in the direction of the distance vector and depends on distance only), the specific angular momentum vector $\boldsymbol{L}=\boldsymbol{r}\times\boldsymbol{v}$ is conserved ($\boldsymbol{r}$ is position and $\boldsymbol{v}$ the velocity). In particular $L=|\boldsymbol{L}|=rv_t$ (with $v_t$ the tangential velocity: the component of velocity perpendicular to the direction Earth-Sun). The specific orbital energy $E=\tfrac{1}{2}|\boldsymbol{v}|^2-GM/r$ is also conserved and must be negative for a bound orbit (such as Earth's). Combining these two we have
$$
E = \tfrac{1}{2}v_r^2 + \frac{L^2}{2r^2} - \frac{GM}{r}
$$
with $v_r$ the radial component of velocity. Since $v_r^2\ge0$, but $E&lt;0$, not all radii are reachable. In particular there are two radii at which $v_r=0$: the apo- and peri-apse of the orbit.</p>

<p>In fact, for the Earth, the peri- and apo- apse are quite similar, and the orbit is nearly circular. The gravitational pull of the Sun is very nearly balanced by the centrifugal force due to the rotating orbit.</p>

<hr>

<p>In GR, the picture doesn't really change much. Non-Newtonian (GR) effects are tiny in the Solar system and completely unimportant for Earth's orbit.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that the picture of pushing by ripples in space time (vs. pull from Sun's gravity) doesn't make a difference either. The point is that just because you're pushed some way doesn't imply that you're falling that way. All bodies also have something called inertia which makes them want to follow their path rather being pushed around. In case of a circular orbit (similar to Earth's around the Sun), gravity and inertia balance in such a way as to create a circular orbit: inertia want's to go straight, gravity want's to pull/push you into the Sun, but the result is something between those. </p>

"Why do the rings around the Gas Giants get their 'ring' shape?","675","","<p>In our Solar System, all the gas giants have ring systems. However, why do these rings form rings and not a cloud of debris around the planet? </p>
","<p>There are different theories as to how planetary rings form, and so there are different answers to your question. </p>

<p>One theory of planetary ring formation is that a small (or large, depending on the ring size) moon wandered into the gas giant's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Roche limit</a> (the radius from the celestial body inside which no second celestial body can stay intact due to tidal disruptions by the larger body). The moon would have been orbiting the planet, and would thus have been moving in a flat . The resulting debris continued to move in a plane; if it had been angled, <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/6552/56299"">collisions would have flattened it</a>.</p>

<p>Another theory is that the debris is left over from the early Solar System. A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">protoplanetary disk</a> formed around the Sun; it contained all the material that makes up the planets. Over time (and through a lot of collisions!), bits of the material slammed together and formed planets. The trouble is, not all of that material became planets. Some became asteroids, some became comets, and some became moons (although the theory of the formation of the Earth's moon is a bit different). Some of this material could also have coalesced around planets.</p>

<p>Now, the protoplanetary disk would already have been in a disk shape. Why? Think of a rotating object - like a planet. You might have read that the Earth is not a sphere. Aside from the obvious deviations of mountains and valleys, some of the deformation comes from the Earth's rotation. Any rotating body will bulge a little around its equator; a spherical body will become an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid#Oblate_spheroids"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">oblate spheroid</a>. The same thing happened for the protoplanetary disk - it became a disk because it was rotating! Any material that coalesced around planets would already be in a plane - that's why the planets' orbits aren't at odd angles to each other. So this material would be in a flat shape if it was captured by the planets, and would become a circular ring because of rotation. If, at that point, there was material that <em>wasn't</em> in a flat plane, it would become flat by the same process that made the protoplanetary disk flat.</p>

<p>There are stellar systems where the protoplanetary disk isn't in the same plane as the <em>star's rotation</em>. This could affect planetary orbits; however, such systems have not been thoroughly studied because of their rarity.</p>

"Is it possible for the Sun and the Moon to crash into each other?","674","","<p>Is it possible for the Sun and the Moon to crash into each other?</p>

<p>If yes, under what conditions? If no, why?</p>
","<p>Technically speaking, only the Moon would crash into the Sun.  That being said, it's certainty one of many possibilities in the far distant future.</p>

<p>About 7.6 billion years from now, the Sun will have ballooned to a large enough size to engulf much of the inner solar system.  One of the consequences of growing into a small red giant will be mass lost due to a rapid sheding of material through a stronger solar wind.  This mass loss will allow all of the planets to be pulled on by the Sun less, and they can achieve a higher orbit.  In Earth's case, it could be as much as 1.2 AU from the center of the Sun.  Also, there will eventually be a large increase in the solar wind density where Earth orbits the Sun.  This solar wind and chromosphere will create drag on Earth while in motion around the Sun, and will rob the planet of its angular momentum (orbital velocity).  The Earth will slowly begin to transition into a smaller orbit, and some sources think that this may lead to the Earth falling into the Sun.</p>

<p>In this scenario, Earth-Moon system is gravitationally stable, and the Earth has sufficient gravity to hold onto the Moon during this time - Earth will pull the Moon down with it.</p>

<p>What is not known to me is if the drag from the solar wind and chromospher will cause the Moon to lose enough angular momentum to spiral inwards, ultimately merging with the Earth before the Earth is engulfed by the Sun.  This would be a spectacular sight, as the moon would first be ripped apart by the tidal interaction with Earth (inside the Roche limit, or about 11,500 miles from the center of the Earth).  Our Moon would resemble a string of moonlets, each eventually falling to Earth.  Either way, the result is the same - the Moon will only exist within the Sun.</p>

"What was the length of year 1 million years back?","674","","<p>We know that the universe is gradually expanding and this indirectly means that the gravitational force between sun, earth, planets and other stars (roughly anything in the universe) is gradually decreasing as gravitational force is indirectly proportional to square of distance between the objects.</p>

<p>So I think this also effects to length of the year. If yes then is it possible to know how days does 1 year had 1 million year back?</p>
","<p>The Hubble expansion has no bearing whatsoever on the length of the year. This is because the whole Milky Way galaxy (and in fact most galaxies, if not all, and even local groups) has decoupled from the Hubble flow long ago. In fact, it could only form after it decoupled. Note that M31, our sister galaxy, is in fact falling onto the Milky Way rather than receding (as the Hubble flow would imply), demonstrating that the whole of the Local Group (of galaxies) is decoupled from the Hubble flow.</p>

<p>What happens is that any over-density expands at less than the Hubble rate and thereby grows. Galaxies (and larger structures) form from small relative over-densities that eventually grow large enough to withstand the overall expansion and instead collapse under their own gravity to form bound objects, such as galaxy clusters, galaxies, star clusters, and stars. This implies that the Hubble flow has no bearing on the inner dynamics of such systems.</p>

<p>Of course, the number of days in a year was higher in the past than today, but that is only because the Earth is spinning down (due to tidal friction with the Moon), so that the days become longer.</p>

<p>If anything has had an effect on the semi-major axis of the Earth orbit (and hence on its period), then that is gravitational interactions with the other planets. However, weak interactions (secular perturbations) can only alter the orbital eccentricity and leave the semi-major axis unaltered.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a tiny effect from the Sun loosing mass (to the Solar wind). The period of any orbiting bodies is proportional to $M_\odot^{-1/2}$.</p>

I've seen estimates between 26 and 32 million years with the solar-system, rising above then below the plane of the Milky way with consistency (and perhaps, mass extinctions tied to this movement).   </p>

<p>I can kind of see that happening, as the sun rises above it might have more gravitational pull below it drawing it back down and you kind of have a horizontal velocity to displacement cycle creating a sine wave in the orbit. That makes logical sense, but I'm wondering if that 26-32 million year sine wave type of movement is generally accepted or more somebody's imagination. Is anything definitive known about stars' orbits within galaxies?</p>
","<p>It is correct that the sun bobs ""up and down"" (relative to the plane of the galaxy as it orbits the galaxy, and it takes about 64 million years  to complete a full cycle, so it does pass through the plane of the galaxy every 32 million years or so (there are quite large error bars on those numbers.) </p>

<p>This idea is uncontroversial, but it gets caught up in other theories that are less well established (for example the idea that there are dense clumps of dark matter in the galactic plane, that can have disrupt the Oort cloud, or otherwise cause mass extinction) or are simply nonsense (the idea that the solar system is a ""vortex"").</p>

<p>Lisa Randall's is a serious scientist, who would have no truck with ""solar system vortices"", and the ideas in her book are reasonable, but not uncontroversial. We have no evidence of dense clumps of dark matter, nor do we know exactly where the Earth was 65 million years ago. <a href=""http://earthsky.org/human-world/will-our-solar-system-cross-the-galactic-plane-on-december-21-2012"" rel=""nofollow"">We last passed through the galactic plane about 3 million years ago</a>, without serious consequences.</p>

How could we refute this?","666","","<p>Trying to wrap my head around some concepts involving the very large gravitational fields of black holes, and what the gravitational gradients look like on a cosmic scale.</p>

<p>I'm familiar with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Attractor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Great Attractor"">Great Attractor</a>, and wondered if it were possible if the Milky Way and it's neighbors are already ""doomed"" to fall into whatever the anomaly is.</p>

<hr>

<p>Per recommendation, I've moved the second half of my question to a new Question here: <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/6318/assuming-a-sufficient-amount-of-mass-above-the-density-threshold-does-the-actua"">Assuming a sufficient amount of mass above the density threshold, does the actual concentration of the mass matter in creating a black hole?</a></p>

  <p>Extrapolating further, I've heard that the actual density of a black hole (within the volume of the event horizon) is pretty low, on the order of thin atmosphere - does that mean that any sufficiently large volume of mass over that density is also a black hole? Or does the actual concentration within the event horizon matter?</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>This isn't anything near a proof that we <em>don't</em> live inside a black hole, but it's a bundle of evidence that certainly goes against it, and that the Great Attractor is not, in fact, the singularity.</p>

<p>First off: Expansion of the universe.</p>

<p>As you no doubt know, the universe is expanding. In fact, the expansion is accelerating. Do black holes expand? Yes. As they suck in more matter, they can get bigger. But if that was the case, we should notice more matter coming into the universe (well, I suppose it could be from outside the visible universe, but we should still see lots of matter coming towards us). Also, the universe's expansion is driven by dark energy, and it pushes (on a large scale) everything away from each other. In an expanding black hole, there would be no reason for the matter inside the event horizon to move away from each other; only the event horizon expands. </p>

<p>You also made a good point in a comment below about Hawking radiation. Eventually, in the far future, when there is nothing left in the universe but black holes, black holes will evaporate via Hawking radiation (okay, they do that now, but they can still take in more matter). If our universe is a black hole, it should then contract. But we see no reason why it should. In fact, the theory that predicts the universe's eventual collapse into a singularity (i.e. the opposite of the Big Bang), the Big Crunch theory, predicts that the universe's contraction will match its expansion. Contraction due to Hawking radiation wouldn't necessarily mirror the black hole's growth. Also, the Big Crunch theory is supported only by a minority of scientists due to the evidence against it.</p>

<p>Second off: The motion of galaxies by the Great Attractor.</p>

<p>First off, see <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/6288/when-will-the-milky-way-arrive-at-the-great-attractor-and-what-all-happen-the"">When will the Milky Way &quot;arrive&quot; at the Great Attractor, and what all happen then?</a> (and not just my answer! I dearly wish @LCD3 would expand his/her comment into an answer!). The general gist of things there, as pertains to your remark about the Great Attractor, is that <em>the galaxies aren't all moving towards it</em>. There are doubts (see the papers I mentioned) that the galaxies previously thought to be moving towards it are, in fact, moving towards more distant objects - other superclusters. If the Great Attractor was indeed the singularity, a) all the galaxies in the universe should be accelerating towards it, which is not the case, and b) we should be moving directly towards it, and due to its gravity, not that of the superclusters beyond.</p>

<p>Like I said in my comments, I don't quite think your last part relates to your first part, but I'll try to address it. First, I'm not sure where you got your sources, but I can say that we don't really know what goes on inside a black hole, and I don't now how someone got that density figure (I am, of course, not the authority on black holes - see @JohnRennie for that, on Physics SE, and I could be wrong about this). The density inside the event horizon would not be very thin, however, in regions where there is lots of matter. For example, in a black hole with an accretion disk, the material that is being absorbed might not have that low a density. Also, a large volume of that density would not necessarily collapse to become a black hole, because it would not be compact enough.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

"Do we get any benefit from being in a galaxy?","665","","<p>If our solar system were to somehow be created outside of a galaxy as a single star in the vast nothingness between galaxies, would life on Earth change any?</p>

<p>Does being a member of a galaxy actually provide some kind of benefit to our solar system or the creation/sustaining of life?</p>
","<p>I've had my eye on this question for some time, but I haven't had the time to answer it. Sorry for not getting to it sooner.</p>

<p>As zibadawa timmy said, you'd be hard-pressed to find the materials necessary for a star system if you're outside a galaxy. For one thing, there aren't any <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stellar nurseries</a> in the intergalactic void (well, none that we know of. But I'd guess it's highly unlikely that they exist plentifully). So you have no hydrogen or helium, or dust, or other elements - in fact, you have nothing that you could use. That's a wee bit of a problem.</p>

<p>There is a way you could get around this, though - if your star system is in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">globular cluster</a>. They're groups of stars that orbit a galaxy. We don't know just how they got out there. They could be from dwarf galaxies, which then lost them, or they could have been partially chucked out of the larger galaxy but stayed in an orbit. The trouble is, as Wikipedia says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, they are not thought to be favorable locations for the survival of planetary systems. Planetary orbits are dynamically unstable within the cores of dense clusters because of the perturbations of passing stars. A planet orbiting at 1 astronomical unit around a star that is within the core of a dense cluster such as 47 Tucanae would only survive on the order of $10^8$ years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep. Not a great place to live.</p>

<p>But I take it you didn't intend for our solar system to be in a globular cluster, so I'll go back into <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space#Intergalactic_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">intergalactic space</a>. It's not actually a vacuum - not that most parts of outer space are. There's a lot of plasma and hot gas there (the intergalactic medium), sometimes getting to a toasty $10^5$ or $10^7 \text { K}$. Could it harbor a stellar system? That depends on just what material the star brings with it. If <a href=""http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/COMPLETE/learn/planets/planets.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">planets haven't formed</a> around it yet, and the star has a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">protplanetary disk</a>, then perhaps that disk could dominate over the intergalactic medium. Remove the ICM and maybe planetary formation could proceed normally.</p>

<p>What happens then? Well, there would be some interesting effects. For example, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oort Cloud</a> might not have become spherical, because it was partly deformed by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_tide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">galactic tide</a>. Here, tidal forces probably wouldn't be as strong (although this depends in part on just how far away we are from the galaxy). We probably wouldn't have a lot of negative effects, because we don't have a lot of extreme benefits here in the Milky Way. Our galaxy does not appear to have an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AGN</a>, there aren't any monstrous black holes nearby, and we aren't undergoing any catastrophic <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interacting_galaxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">galactic collisions</a>.

<p>We probably wouldn't be in too bad of a position if we were <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergalactic_star"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in intergalactic space</a>. There's not a <em>lot</em> of benefits from being in a galaxy - well, no significant ones, at least. Well, besides star formation depositing all the materials we need for the solar system to form.

"How can we tell the difference between matter and antimatter by observation in space?","664","","<p>I just was wondering and searching on the internet with little luck in the topic. On Antimatter Wiki they tell the observable universe is built up by matter. I read antimatter can be detected in cosmic rays in very small quantity. But let's go in theories and our practical knowledge, my question is:</p>

<p>How could we detect if a set of objects (like an entire galaxy) is completely built up by antimatter? Since matter and antimatter look like ""mirror image"" on current, could they form a similar object which is indistinguishable from ""our"" matter objects? I mean, would spectrum analysis for example show that it is not matter, but built up by antimatter?</p>

<p>Linked question: Are we sure about that what we see in universe is matter?</p>
","<h2>Tl;DR</h2>

<ul>
<li>Detection via <strong>polarized light</strong> - Antimatter interaction with polarized light could be detected by vector rotation;</li>
<li>We're <strong><em>mostly</em> sure</strong>, because absence of gamma rays and characteristic Faraday polarization indicates absence of observable antimatter in meaningful amounts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Long answer</h2>

<p>I do believe @userLTK to be correct on his comment.</p>

<p>To my limited knowledge, the absence of gamma-ray bursts that characterizes matter-antimatter interactions hints of baryonic matter prevalence throughout the visible universe; an anti-galaxy near a baryonic galaxy would show a healthy amount of gamma rays originating from boundary particle collisions.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LyAjq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This effect would be observable between structures of any scale - e.g. star/anti-star, galaxy/anti-galaxy or supercluster/anti-supercluster.</p>

<blockquote>

  exactly the same, quite independent of whether atoms or anti-atoms are
  responsible for the light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the light originating from anti-galaxies would look the same as ordinary galaxies. But what about gravity?</p>

<p>A quote from <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=T43ZoeIan64C&amp;pg=PA317&amp;lpg=PA317&amp;dq=light%20originating%20from%20anti-matter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u6_o3ZWqEv&amp;sig=TzYMlXCz2SzPKCmsXspvOWQ6MW4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lsldVfnJI4GqNvCkgagN&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=light%20originating%20from%20anti-matter&amp;f=false"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Isodual Theory of Antimatter: with applications to Antigravity, Grand Unification and Cosmology""</a> may help us further:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] However, the photons is invariant under charge conjugation and

  photon could well result to be a superposition of positive and
  negative energies, perhaps as a condition to travel at the speed <em>c</em>,
  in which case the photon would be an isoselfdual state, thus
  experiencing attraction in both fields of matter and antimatter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning that antimatter would also cause gravitational effects, such as lensing.</p>

<p>That would make remote detection of anti-matter quite hard - it would emit and bend light in exactly the same fashion as common matter.</p>

<p>Faraday polarization rotation could give us some hope:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Polarized light, e.g., from non-thermal synchrotron sources, that
  passes through gas with a non-zero magnetic field will have its
  polarization vector rotated by the process of Faraday rotation. [...]
  Note that regions dominated by antimatter (positrons) cause a rotation

","<p>Regular digital cameras <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_filter_array"" rel=""nofollow"">color filter arrays</a> that put the pixel sensors so that it only detects a particular color. Therefore, there is a trade-off, because without the filter array, you would have a significantly higher-resolution black-and-white image.</p>

<p>However, most scientific digital cameras work differently. Rather, the usual technique is to put filters over the entire image, and switch out the filters if a different color is required. Subsequent differently-filtered images can then be combined into one image. But there's still a trade-off: putting in filters decreases the dynamic range of the camera significantly. Additionally, this approach does not require one to use the usual <em>red</em>, <em>green</em>, <em>blue</em> scheme; e.g., and IR filter would allow one to emphasize different features.</p>

<p>It is very likely that they simply didn't bother to put color filters in the cameras. Why would they? The colors are probably rather drab on the comet anyway, and it unnecessarily increases the complexity of the cameras (which is already a quite complicated panoramic array).</p>

"Does any iron fuse in stars before they go supernova?","658","","<p>I understand that iron and all heavier elements consume more energy to produce than they make, and that is what eventually leads to a supernova. I also understand that a lot of the heavier elements are produced during that supernova. However, what I'm wondering is, before the star goes supernova, does any of the iron fuse with other elements? Yes, there would be a net energy loss, but if there is only small amount of iron in the star, it would probably be able to handle that.</p>
","<p>Yes, but it's slow.   (I'm not an expert, so feel free to correct if I miss something important), but once the star is into the later stages, past the Helium stage, up to Iron, fusion mostly takes place by fusing a helium onto a heavier element, raising each atomic number by 2.  That's not the only method but it's the most common.   </p>

<p>Iron can also fuse into Nickle in this way inside a star and it does in small amounts, but mostly beyond Iron, and certainly beyond Nickle, heavier elements are created through the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process"">S-Process</a>.   (short for slow neutron capture process).   This happens when a free neutron binds to the atomic nucleus and over time, the addition of Neutrons can lead to beta decay, where an electron is ejected and a proton remains - adding to the atomic number.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but if there is only small amount of iron in the star, it would
  probably be able to handle that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is undoubtedly true.  The Stars that go super-nova are incredibly large and the Iron doesn't exactly fall to the core right away.  It takes some time.    For a star to go kablooie (Super-Nova), it needs an Iron core of both enough purity where it's no longer undergoing expansion from nearby fusion, and enough size for it to undergo rapid collapse in a way that effects the star around it almost instantaneously.    I'm not clear on the exact process, but it requires way more than just a little Iron.    As a layman's guess, it might require a Jupiter sized ball of Iron.  Perhaps a fair bit more than that. </p>

As we all know, we can even see ISS with the naked eye in a clear sky as a passing star without any blinking.</p>

<p>But unfortunately, I don't know how to measure the angle on the sky to see it. On the official NASA website there's given height (altitude) and direction as 21° and 11 above N respectively.</p>

<p>Here is the link: <a href=""http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=India&amp;region=None&amp;city=Hyderabad#.UwxIRs6haTs"" rel=""nofollow"">NASA - Spot The Station</a></p>

<p>How do I trace ISS?</p>
","<p>The official site you point to has 3 pieces of location information:
1) the max height angle
2) the point it appears
3) the point it disappears
The only one of these that is especially accurate is the max height angle, and that isn't the number you want to use to try and see it. However, passes with a bigger number for the max height angle will be easier to see.</p>

<p>To find the ISS, get the reference to the point it ""Appears"" - that is the ""11 above N"" you have described. Now, notice that the reference to the compass direction is simply N or NNE or SW or whatever. This is not a precise directional reference, but it doesn't need to be, as if you're looking towards that direction, you shouldn't have any problem seeing ISS appear. It isn't clear to me if the website is using True North or Magnetic North for the direction; Magnetic North might be easier for people with a simple compass to find, but usually these directions will be relative to True North, which is not where a compass points. From a quick check using my own location, it appears that they have used True North, which is maybe a bit unfortunate. If you don't know where True North is for your location, <a href=""http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#declination"" rel=""nofollow"">you can look it up</a>, and then you have to remember to adjust the reading off your compass by the offset for your location.</p>

<p>Notice that the description is ""11 above N"". This means 11 degrees above the N direction. The reason for it appearing some distance above the horizon is because it is coming up out of the shadow of the Earth, which is being cast some distance above the horizon.</p>

<p>To quickly and easily estimate angular distances, <a href=""http://oneminuteastronomer.com/860/measuring-sky/"" rel=""nofollow"">use the trick of observing your hand at arms length</a>. Different parts give different angular dimensions. It is a pretty fair estimate, because no matter how big or small you are, the relative size of your hands and the length of your arms is probably about the same as everyone else... not good enough to use as a survey instrument, but good enough to guesstimate locations on the sky.</p>

<p>The second position description is the ""Disappears"" location. That is where the ISS will again drop into the shadow of the Earth. Similarly, it is described as degrees above a True North compass direction. </p>

<p>You can figure out (approx) the path the ISS will take by drawing an imaginary line between these two points. However, don't draw that imaginary line so it goes over your head, note the ""Max Height"" angle again: this is the highest point on the line that you draw between the ""Appears"" and ""Disappears"" spots. </p>

<p>Just give it a go, especially one with a pass that starts around 30mins or so after sunset, and that has a high ""Max Height"" angle. It won't be hard to see.</p>

"What is the frequency distribution for luminosity classes in the Milky Way Galaxy?","654","","<p>I'm working on a game concept that does some mild simulation of realistic stellar classes and luminosities. In particular, I'd like to roughly model the general frequencies of the classes and luminosities of the stars in the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Several sources, including Wikipedia's entry on stellar classifications, show a chart that includes the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Harvard_spectral_classification"">frequency distribution for spectral classification</a>: the OBAFGKM categorization. So that's fine.</p>

<p>What I'm having trouble finding is any frequency distribution chart similar to that one but for the Yerkes luminosity categories: Ia+, Ia, Iab, Ib, II, III, IV, V, sub-dwarf and dwarf. I have a copy of the Hipparcos database, which contains a ""Spectral Types"" field, but it's highly incoherent text. Still, I could write some code to parse the values in that field to try to get a rough count of luminosity categories in those roughly 116,000 stars... but I'm a little perplexed that no such chart appears to exist already somewhere in Internetland. (Either that or my search-fu is weaker than usual.)</p>

<p>If anyone can point me to a chart of the frequency distribution for the luminosity categories noted above, or suggest a reasonably simple way for me to calculate those values myself, I'd appreciate it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Out of curiosity, I went ahead and did my own simple parsing of the spectrum fields from the Hipparcos dataset.</p>

<p>Out of 116472 rows, only 56284 (fewer than half) provided luminosity class data in the Spectrum field. Those 56284 rows broke down this way:</p>

<pre>Ia0     16     0.03%
Ia     241     0.43%
Iab    191     0.34%
Ib     694     1.23%
I       17     0.03%
II    1627     2.89%
III  22026    39.13%
IV    6418    11.40%
V    24873    44.19%
VI      92     0.16%
VII     89     0.16%</pre>

<p>Note: Around 1000+ rows gave an either/or value for luminosity class (e.g., ""M1Ib/II""). In these cases, I counted only the first value provided. This probably skewed the results slightly compared to counting both luminosity classes.</p>

<p>I'm still very curious to know whether anyone else has produced or located a similar table of frequencies for the luminosity classes, if only to see how my very trivial analysis compares.</p>
","<p>Here is how you do it ""properly"" for the Hipparcos data. As Warrick correctly points out, what you have done in your question is massively biased towards giant and supergiant stars, which actually form the very small minority of stars.</p>

<p>You must form a <em>volume limited sample</em>. To do this, sort the stars by distance (1/parallax) and choose a cut off point. Your sample will always be incomplete, but the greater your distance cut off, the more incomplete it will be and it will become incomplete for more intrinsically luminous stars.</p>

<p>You have a philosophical problem to solve here in terms of what you are trying to achieve. The vast majority of stars in the Galaxy are faint M dwarfs with an absolute magnitude of $&gt;10$. As Hipparcos is only complete to around magnitude 10-11, you will only get these M dwarfs in your subsample if you limit yourself to 10pc. But you will find that this sample contains no evolved stars (too rare) and no white dwarfs (too faint).</p>

<p>EDIT: 
This has piqued my interest again, so I have a practical (approximate) solution, based on a two-part process. The first part involves a <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0143-0807/24/2/303"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paper I wrote</a> (actully an undergraduate experiment) based on the nearest 1000 stars to the Sun (from the Gliese &amp; Jahreiss catalogue CNS3). This sample is roughly complete down to mid M-dwarfs, so everything else I say, and the results I give, only applies to a sample of stars more massive than that.</p>

<p>If you look at this volume-limited sample of 1000 nearby stars you can straight away say something about the relative numbers of different types of stars in the Galactic disk (saying something about stars anywhere else in the Galaxy is filled with much more uncertainty). A colour-magnitude diagram is shown below, and from this we see that:</p>

<p>The Sun is among the brightest of stars - brighter than 95% of other stars.</p>

<p>About 6% of the population are white dwarfs (though a few faint, old white dwarfs may still be missing from the sample). This makes sense. If you integrate a typical mass function assuming only stars more massive than about 1$M_{\odot}$ have even had time to become white dwarfs, then this is what you get.</p>

<p>Only 0.9% of the population are giants. The reason for this is that only a small proportion of stars are massive enough to have evolved into giants on the lifetime of the Galaxy. But once they are there, their lifetimes are short compared to the main sequence phase and most have become white dwarfs (see above).</p>

<p>There are a handful of objects, maybe 0.5%, that could be classified as subdwarfs, between the main sequence and the white dwarfs.</p>

<p>So, in broad terms: 92.5% of stars (above $\sim 0.2M_{\odot}$) are main sequence (class V), 6% are white dwarfs, 1% are giants (class III) and 0.5% are subdwarfs (class VI).</p>

<p>There are no very massive stars or supergiants in the immediate solar neighbourhood. That is because they are very rare. To get a better estimate we need to look at a larger volume limited sample. To do this I took all the stars (about 7000) from the Hipparcos catalogue that are closer than 50pc and assumed this was <em>complete</em> to just below a solar luminosity and assumed that those stars with an absolute magnitude brighter than the Sun (1949 stars with $M_V&lt;4.5$ represent 5% of the <em>total</em> population in this volume. The absolute magnitude vs colour diagram for this sample is shown below. </p>

<p>Of these 1949 luminous stars, I find roughly 190 are giants - giving a giant fraction of $5\times 190/1940=0.5$%, in reasonable agreement with the nearby star sample based on smaller numbers. There are still NO supergiants, even in this larger sample. Thus supergiants have a frequency of $\leq 5 \times 1/1949 = 0.0025$%. i.e. less than 1 star per 40,000 is a supergiant.</p>

"Is there a term for stars without any planets?","653","","<p>Quite simply, is there any used term for stars that don't have any planets? While contemplating this and doing numerous searches to no avail, I think I found my own answer, but I'm asking here for more input.</p>

<p>The reason I think there is no real term used as such is because there is yet to be confirmed of any stars that do not consist of any planets. I'm aware that we know of stars at this point in time where we haven't identified any planets YET, but that is not the same as actually confirming if planets do or do not exist around the star. </p>

<p>Am I correct in assuming this is the reason why no term has came to fruition yet? Or is there a term used in relation to talking about the possibility of none existing?</p>

<p>I've searched a fair bit for this but haven't been able to find anything. I know that current models show that it's highly unlikely for this to occur, but I'm curious.</p>
","<p>A star is described as such whether or not it has planets.</p>

<p>There doesn't appear to have ever been a need, and to be honest, I can't think of any need for one. When it was assumed (in historical times) that we were on the only planet, stars were not thought to have planets. The title worked then. Now, as we know most stars are likely to have planets as part of normal formation, we can still call them stars.</p>

"What does forward modeling mean?","653","","<p>In my research on exoplanets, I have heard many people talk ""forward modeling of exoplanet atmospheres"".  I don't know what the ""forward"" means in ""forward modeling"" and how it compares with ""reverse modeling"", if that's even a thing.</p>

<p>What is forward modeling, and why is it so special that it needs to be distinguished from just plain ol' regular modeling?</p>
","<p>There are different ways to model something. From what you're asking, there are two main types of modeling: forward modeling and inverse modeling.</p>

<p><strong>Forward Modeling</strong></p>

<p>In this type of modeling, you have a specific model that defines the ""current"" state of your system. In the case of exoplanet atmospheres, it'd likely be something that defines the molecular content, ionization level, density, etc. of your exoplanet atmosphere. Then, you use the known physics/math of your system to decide how it will behave. In this setup, what you've created is a system for predicting system states from a predetermined physics model.</p>

<p>Such an example would be someone creating their own atmosphere of an exoplanet in a model and then saying, okay what happens when I shine light through this atmosphere. What observations might I record?</p>

<p><strong>Inverse Modeling</strong></p>

<p>In some sense this is the opposite of forward modeling, albeit it doesn't really mean you're running a model to see into the past. Instead, what happens with this setup is you know a particular state or result, and you want to construct a model of your system which can produce said state. Essentially, you want your model to arrive at a certain state when it is done calculating. If it does, you have a reasonable confidence that your model was some indication of what your system is actually like.</p>

<p>In this situation, you'd measure components of the atmosphere, e.g. the radius of the planet as a function of wavelength, and then create a model of the atmosphere which can hopefully reproduce your observations. If you can, then the hope is that the model accurately represents what your system is.</p>

"Can a gas moon exist?","651","","<p>Could a gaseous moon exist in the same way as a giant gas planet? All the moons in the solar system are rocky, or icy. Why shouldn't gas planets  have gas moons? </p>
","<p><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/12501/can-a-gas-moon-exist#comment17661_12501"">LocalFluff's comment</a> is spot-on. You need mass to have gas, and moons just don't have enough.</p>

<p>It is thought that gas giants gathered the gas they have today by accreting large amounts of it from the protoplanetary disk in the early days of the Solar System. At first, they were only gas-less cores (not rocky, exactly, but not gaseous), but they quickly became the most massive objects in their immediate vicinities, and thus gobbled up all the gas nearby them.</p>

<p>Now, less massive bodies, like Earth, can still accrete gas. However, they have difficulty retaining it. <a href=""http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/02/17/mnras.stu085.full.pdf"">Lammer et al. (2014)</a> calculated that under conditions like those experienced in the young Solar System, planets of one Earth mass or less could retain captured hydrogen envelopes for no more than ~100 million years - a long time for us humans, but shorter for astronomical objects.</p>

<p>The hydrogen escapes via <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape"">atmospheric escape</a>, which happens when particles in the atmosphere have velocities higher than escape velocity. This phenomenon is known as Jeans escape. Atmospheric escape happens more often with lighter gases, such as hydrogen. It is also influenced by stellar winds, which can cause even gas giants (generally close to the star, such as hot Jupiters) to lose some or all of their atmospheres.</p>

<p>I wouldn't call gas moons impossible, but certainly very unlikely.</p>

"Why do the planets in the Solar system stay in the same orbital plane?","647","","<p>An earlier question addressed why all planets formed in the same orbital plane, but how is this angle maintained? What prevents the planets from taking on a different orbital plane?</p>
","<h2>Angular momentum conservation</h2>

<p>To put it in more mathematical terms, you can play with the energy and the angular momentum of a bunch of particles orbinting a central mass $M$, given by</p>

<p>$$E = \sum_i m_i \left(\frac{1}{2}v_i^2 - \frac{GM}{r_i}\right),$$</p>

<p>for the energy and</p>

<p>$${\bf I} = \sum_i m_i {\bf r}_i \times {\bf v_i},$$</p>

<p>for the angular momentum. Now, let's try to extremize the energy for a given angular momentum, keeping in mind that the system has to conserve angular momentum, and that collisions between the particles can reduce the energy. One good way to do it is to use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier"">Lagrange multiplier</a></p>

<p>$$\delta E - \lambda\cdot\delta {\bf I} = \sum_i\left[\delta {\bf v}_i \cdot \left({\bf v}_i - \lambda \cdot {\bf r}_i \right) + \delta {\bf r}_i \cdot \left( \frac{GM}{r_i^3} + \lambda \times {\bf v}_i\right)\right],$$</p>

<p>that requires</p>

<p>$$\lambda\cdot{\bf r}_i = 0, \qquad {\bf v}_i = \lambda \times {\bf r}_i, \qquad \lambda^2 = \frac{GM}{r_i^3},$$</p>

<p>that means that all orbits are coplanar and circular.</p>

<h2>Is this true in general?</h2>

<p>That's the principle. Note, however, that all the planetary systems <a href=""http://exoplanet.eu/diagrams/?t=s&amp;f=&amp;x=inclination&amp;xmin=&amp;xmax=&amp;y=mass&amp;ymin=min&amp;ymax=max"">do not always stay in an orbital plane</a>. Such systems can be explained by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozai_mechanism"">Lidov-Kozai oscillations</a>, typically trigger by ""high-excentricity migration"" of hot Jupiters (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AAS...21536708F"">Fabrycky, 2012</a>). As far as we know now, we can say that:</p>

<ul>
<li>our Solar System is flat!</li>
<li>planetary systems observed by Kepler are mostly flat (there is kind of an observational bias, due to the transit method);</li>
<li>planetary systems observed by radial-velocity method are more or less flat (with an mean angle between 10 and 20°);</li>

"When we say a galaxy is 200 million light years away, does this account for the expansion of space in the time it took it's light to reach us?","646","","<p>When we see a distant galaxy, the light we are watching started it's journey millions of years ago. In all that time, space has been expanding, so if the initial distance was A, right now the distance would be A+B and, surely, light would take more time to travel A+B than it originally did A.</p>
","<p>Usually the distance data doesn't take the expansion of the universe fully into account. That's not important for a distance of 200 million lightyears, but as we get close to the border of the visible universe, it makes a relevant difference. Therefore astronomers prefer to talk of redshift instead of distance.</p>

<p>To be a little more precise: The light travelling from a galaxy to Earth takes only that part of the expansion of the space between the galaxy and the Earth into account, which it still has to traverse.</p>

<p>For a proper distance measurement in the everyday's sense, we would have to send light to the galaxy and reflect it back to Earth, measure the time, divide it by the speed of light, and take the half of the resulting distance.</p>

<p>If this experiment would be performed, some of the now visible objects would never reflect light back to Earth, because they are already too far away.</p>

<p>The point is; The distance between me and my flashlight is constant as long as I am observing it.</p>

<p>The photons coming from the flashlight would obviously not be rocket powered - and they would be affected by the black holes gravitation.</p>

<p>Would the light I see from the flashlight be shifted towards red or blue, even though the distance between me and my dear flashlight is maintained?</p>

<p>If so; switching the positions of me and my flashlight, would it change the color I'd observe?</p>

<p>If we turn off the rocket on the flashlight, I assume it would be redshifted regardless of which were closer to the singularity, and the magnitude of redshift would appear to accelerate?</p>
","<p>A partial answer: The lower the gravitational potential the slower the clocks, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation"" rel=""nofollow"">Gravitational time dilation</a>. This means, as long as your flashlight is behind you in constant distance, it appears blue-shifted to you. With roles exchanged (light below you in constant distance) it appears red-shifted.
By the heterogeneity of the gravitational field the shift grows with the time, while falling in constant distance.</p>

<p>This is called the Einstein shift, which is not the same as the doppler effect. The doppler effect is caused by an objects velocity relative to the observer.</p>

"Why is the Sun's atmosphere (the corona) so hot?","643","","<p>The visible surface of the Sun is 6000 degrees Celsius but the gas in the solar corona is at least 1 million degrees. What heats the solar corona?</p>
","<p>It is still an open question, even though it is clear that it is linked to the magnetic field of the Sun. The following hypothesis are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Heating waves mechanism:</strong> propagation of magnetohydrodynamic waves can heat significantly the corona. These waves can be produced in the solar photosphere and propagate carrying energy through the solar atmosphere; they turn in the end into shock waves that dissipate energy as heat in the corona.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Magnetic reconnection mechanism:</strong> magnetic field lines are tied to the surface of the Sun and even when the plasma moves, they stay tied to their original position (their ""foot points""); therefore, plasma movements can drag the magnetic field lines and entangled them in geometries such as loops, that can eventually ""reconnect"". ""Reconnection"" corresponds to a modification of the field line topology (see the image that pictures it better than my words). During this process, heat and energy are released quite efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nanoflares mechanism:</strong> the dissipation of a lot of small scale structures (slow convective motions of magnetic foot points could create current sheets, coutinually dissipated and reformed, providing heating through Ohmic dissipation). You can see it as a kind of a lot of magnetic loops reconnecting together, instead of one big loop reconnecting alone.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S7LEY.jpg"" alt=""Magnetic reconnection""></p>

<p>Black lines represent the magnetic field lines. They are tied to the surface of the Sun (the foot points). One of the magnetic field lines is looping, and it is ""crossing itself"". When it reconnects, it forms, on the top, a magnetic loop and, on the bottom, an magnetic arch. As pointed out by this diagram, magnetic reconnection mechanism is also associated to Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), since the energy released by magnetic reconnection is powerful enough to eject a significant amount of matter.</p>

The peaks in the clover curve are regularly separated by about a sunspot cycle, or rather a bit longer. I suppose that the pattern of 2 big and 1 small sequential bulbs there reflects that Jupiter's and Saturn's orbital periods are about 3:1.</p>

<p>As StephenG says, that is just a numerological hint or coincidence, not an explanation. Another example is that the rotational period of the Sun is roughly similar to the orbital period of the Moon around Earth, with a similar error, but no one imagines any connection there.</p>

<p>It is however known that hot Jupiters, giant planets near stars, cause large starspots which rotate along with the planet's orbit.

"Do stars of a galaxy change their positions relatively to each other?","637","","<p>Complete astronomy noob over here who would be happy if he get a simple answer (and who is also aware that this may be not possible)...</p>

<p>I've learned from a tv documentary that the stars at the edge of the galaxy are not traveling more slowely than the ones closer to the center. </p>

<p>Does this also mean that all stars in a galaxy do not change their positions relatively to each other? </p>

<p>To put it simply: If I note the relative position of a star compared to our sun, and then do it again 10 (100 / 1000) years later: Are the coordinates of that star identical or will the star be in a different relative position?</p>

<p>I would assume that the star is in a completely different (relative) place given the speed star systems are travelling because the galaxy is rotating AND the ""fact"" (read: I don't know if this is really a fact) that the solar system is oscillating through the galactic plane. </p>
","<p>Stars do in fact move relative to one another within galaxies of all types. The orbital period of stars in a typical spiral galaxy (at around the same distance as the Sun is from the center of the Milky Way) is on the order of hundreds of millions of years. For the Sun it's something like 230 million years (<a href=""http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/StacyLeong.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>). A particularly old person (~100 years old), will have been around long enough to see something like one-tenthousandth of 1% of the orbit of stars in this region of the galaxy! Most of these stars simply do not move much relative to us in that amount of time.</p>

<p>The exception to this view of the motions of the stars is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sagittarius A*</a> (which is not a star at all, but is in fact a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way). The period of stars traveling around it are on the order of 10's of years.</p>

"Is it difficult to see DSO in your eyepiece?","637","","<p>I want to know if bringing the image of a DSO in eyepiece generally represents a problem for beginners in astronomy.</p>
","<p>Some can, some can't. Viewing really is determined by ability, experience and technique when you leave viewing conditions aside.</p>

<p>A lot of DSOs have a lower surface brightness, one thing I always notice is when an observer continuously increases their magnification to see the object larger. Surface brightness is proportional to magnification, the higher the magnification the less bright an object appears, to see an object as bright as possible you need to use the lowest possible magnification. Using a smaller diameter eyepiece (larger magnification), you will need to develop techniques such as averted vision to truly see the beauty of some objects that otherwise appear dull.</p>

<p>Finding them can be exceptionally hard if your not familiar with the viewing region, easily overlooked or thought to be a tuft of cloud. Eye adaption is key when viewing so you need to spend significant time on an object before the details appear.</p>

<p>The Messier objects contain some well known DSOs, and can show some amazing details with patience. Understanding that the Messier objects were cataloged with poor optics and small apertures makes them prime targets for beginners.</p>

"Do we expect life to develop only in certain regions of the galaxy?","635","","<p>If I understand correctly, the Earth lies in an area of the galaxy - the ""local bubble"" - that is relatively free of dust and gases and where no new stars are being born.</p>

<p>What is the current theory on the relation between life on Earth and this location? Or in other words: Would we expect life to exist anywhere in the galaxy, e.g. also inside some nebula, or only in specific areas, and how are they characterised?</p>
","<p>There's a short answer here and a long answer.</p>

<p><strong>Short Answer:</strong> It isn't special.</p>

<p><strong>Long Answer:</strong> Yes and No.</p>

<p>The Local Bubble really isn't so special with regards to where it's placed in the galaxy. Location-wise, it's perched on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one of the Milky Way's spiral arms. The Orion Arm, too, isn't incredibly special. It's relatively small - it's often referred to as the ""Orion Spur"" - and near 1/4 of the way out from the galactic center. Not too far away, but not too near. The donut-shaped area 4,000-10,000 parsecs out from the galactic center is, however, sometimes called the <em>Galactic Habitable Zone</em>. In theory. life as we know it could exist quite nicely any where in this area (I should note that the scientific community is divided on whether the Zone is important, with some saying that it is arbitrary).</p>

<p>But let's dive in deeper. Actually, we're in a decent spot in the ""Arm."" We're on the edge of it - not too near large groups of stars that could effect our system via gravity, or near any supernova candidates. And the ""Arm"" itself isn't really a spiral arm. It is, as I said earlier, more of a spur, or bulge. There aren't as many stars to watch out for. Also, we're near the <em>corotation circle</em> - i.e., we orbit the galaxy at such a distance that we move at a similar speed to the arms, reducing further the likelihood of crossing them. Is this necessary for life? Nope. But does it help? Oh, yes.</p>

<p>There are, of course, other factors that make this area a nice spot: No black holes nearby, gamma-ray bursts, etc. But could life survive elsewhere? Yep. These same characteristics can be found in many other places in the galaxy - and life can probably survive in even more dangerous spots.</p>

<p>By the way, I'd avoid using the term ""nebula"". Technically, we're not in one, or anywhere near one. The term can refer to a multitude of objects - planet-forming areas, ""clouds"" surrounding white dwarfs, and other rather photogenic places - none of which we inhabit.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

"How did the lighter elements end up in the center of the solar system? Solar System Formation","635","","<p>The previous generation of stars famously are the origin of all the heavier elements (up until iron?) in the solar system. So a big portion of the solar system mass actually is made up of Carbon, Silicon, Iron and the like because of that. But in the center, and only in the center, there is a star with presumably almost no heavy elements inside. How can that be? Am I wrong about the actual mass concentrations or is there really an imbalance, i.e. is the element distribution really lighter towards the center of the solar system? I would presume that the previous generation of stars just ended in a more or less uniform cloud of debris, from which the solar system formed. But if so, why aren’t there star systems where the star has a very different composition and is kind of a spluttering, dirty fusion machine (metaphorically, I mean)?</p>
","<p>The solar system contains very little of elements heavier than Helium - less than 2% by mass.</p>

<p>This is reflected in the chemical abundances measured in the photosphere of the Sun. i.e. The Sun does contain heavier elements.</p>

<p>Your question is the wrong way around; it is not that the heavier elements have not sunk into the middle, it is that the vast majority of hydrogen and helium that was in the same place as the planets when they formed, did not end up as part of the planets. In fact, even this is only partially true. The mass of planetary material in the solar system is also dominated by the hydrogen and helium in the gas giants.</p>

<p>So the conundrum is only why the smaller planets don't have a similar composition to the Sun. The answer to that is temperature and gravity. A small, hot planet just doesn't have the gravity to retain fast moving hydrogen and helium atoms, unless they are trapped in some compound (like water!).</p>

<p>Thus, the small planets close to the Sun are depleted of light elements.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recently a population of large, very low surface brightness, spheroidal galaxies was identified in the Coma cluster. The apparent survival of these Ultra Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) in a rich cluster suggests that they have very high masses. Here we present the stellar kinematics of Dragonfly 44, one of the largest Coma UDGs, using a 33.5 hr integration with DEIMOS on the Keck II telescope. We find a velocity dispersion of 47 km/s, which implies a dynamical mass of M_dyn=0.7x10^10 M_sun <strong>within its deprojected half-light radius</strong> (<em>my emphasis</em>) of r_1/2=4.6 kpc. The mass-to-light ratio is M/L=48 M_sun/L_sun, and the dark matter fraction is 98 percent within the half-light radius. The high mass of Dragonfly 44 is accompanied by a large globular cluster population. From deep Gemini imaging taken in 0.4"" seeing we infer that Dragonfly 44 has 94 globular clusters, similar to the counts for other galaxies in this mass range. Our results add to other recent evidence that many UDGs are ""failed"" galaxies, with the sizes, dark matter content, and globular cluster systems of much more luminous objects. We estimate the total dark halo mass of Dragonfly 44 by comparing the amount of dark matter within r=4.6 kpc to enclosed mass profiles of NFW halos. The enclosed mass suggests a total mass of ~10^12 M_sun, similar to the mass of the Milky Way. The existence of nearly-dark objects with this mass is unexpected, as galaxy formation is thought to be maximally-efficient in this regime.</p>

","<p>The half light radius is the radius from within which half the luminosity emerges.</p>

<p>""Deprojected"" means that the authors must have fitted some model to the 2D distribution of light, which can then be mathematically deprojected to give them a 3D model for luminosity as a function of radius, that they can then integrate to give a number for the half light radius.</p>

<p>In section 3, the authors explain that they have done this by fitting a ""Sersic profile"" to the surface brightness distribution <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sersic_profile"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sersic_profile</a>  The Sersic profile actually has the 2D half light radius as one of its parameters. But if you imagine looking through a ball of stars, this 2D measurement of the half light radius is an underestimate of the true 3D half light radius, because the surface brightness profile is more sharply peaked than the 3D stellar density distribution that produces it.</p>

<p>The authors appear to approximately correct (deproject) this by multiplying the half light radius by 4/3. They also make a small correction for the non-sphericity of the galaxy. </p>

<p>The deprojection factor depends (slightly) on the $n$ index of the Sersic profile and needs to be found by doing a numerical integral. The details can be found in the appendices of Wolf et al. (2010. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2995"">http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2995</a> ), who also provide expressions to directly estimate mass from the projected half light radius and the line of sight velocity dispersion.</p>

Quoting the introduction text from the linked to Wikipedia page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The apparent magnitude (m) of a celestial body is a measure of its
  brightness as seen by an observer on Earth, adjusted to the value it
  would have in the absence of the atmosphere. The brighter the object
  appears, the lower the value of its magnitude. Generally the visible
  spectrum (vmag) is used as a basis for the apparent magnitude, but
  other regions of the spectrum, such as the near-infrared J-band, are
  also used. In the visible spectrum Sirius is the brightest star in the
  night sky, whereas in the near-infrared J-band, Betelgeuse is the
  brightest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it is of course a useful measure also for the slightly more casual, non-scientific observer to help determine the observed star from its neighboring cluster, or identification in general, I always wondered if there is a way to measure apparent magnitude with enthusiast-class equipment, and what would these procedures be?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BCsWU.jpg"" alt=""apparent magnitude""></p>

<p>Also interesting would be a description of what level of precision and enthusiast can get with such equipment while measuring apparent magnitude of a distant star. If you need specifics to answer the question, such as precise available equipment or subject of observations, please feel free to choose at will any that would broadly match the capabilities of enthusiast-grade equipment.</p>
","<p>The easiest way to determine the magnitude of a given star is probably to use the Pogson relation. The idea is to determine the magnitude of a star knowing the magnitude of a reference star; it is thus quite easy, using a well-known reference as Vega or Sirius.</p>

<p>The Pogson relation is given by:</p>

<p>$$m_1-m_2=-2.5\ log\ \left({\frac{E_1}{E_2}}\right)$$</p>

<p>where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnitudes of star 1 and star 2 (your reference star), and $E_1$ and $E_2$ brightness (that could be in arbitrary units, which is a good news for you).</p>

<p>With a CCD detector the brightness is easy to determine since it's just the flux of a pixel. You don't have to convert it in physical units (as Watt per square meter) since you have a ratio $\left({\frac{E_1}{E_2}}\right)$, so the raw intensity is enough to determine the magnitude.</p>

<p>As for any other measurement with a CCD camera, you have of course to determine the bias, dark and flat-field and to reduce your data before estimating any magnitude. The precision will depend on the number of observations performed and, as always, it is better to perform several short exposure images than a single long exposure one.</p>

There can also be alternative reasons to explain the results mentioned in the paper other than a Jupiter sized planet in the Oort Cloud. As was mentioned in the comments, it is almost impossible to prove the non-existence of something.  </p>

<p>At this time, the results from WISE are the best bet for locating Tyche if it exists.  As it will not be visible in the visible light spectrum but more likely in the infrared and the WISE mission scanned the entire sky which means that it won't have been missed due to looking in the wrong place.</p>

<p>There isn't any hard science to show that Tyche doesn't exist.  It is skepticism that this is the explanation for observations to date.  These are the same reasons that Nemesis isn't thought to exist, the data isn't strong enough to support its existence.</p>

"What's the terminology of a meteor ""ditch"" when impact happens at an angle?","629","","<p>When a meteor hit the surface of a planet, it creates an impact crater. When an meteor hit the surface of a planet at an angle, like it usually happens in the movies, what do you call the long ""ditch"" that is formed before the actual crater where the meteor came to rest?</p>
","<p>I think the answer to this is that it doesn't have a name because such ""ditches"" don't occur for real meteor impacts. In movies and tv shows, these ditches are often shown as being caused by the meteor first hitting the ground at some angle, then sliding across the ground, digging out a ditch along the way, until they come to their final resting point where the crater is.</p>

<p>When you stop to think about it, this scenario doesn't really make sense. These types of images (e.g., <a href=""https://nccasymposium.bournemouth.ac.uk/2005/mscca/DIGGINS_html/images/arm_paris_destroyed.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> or <a href=""http://i1.wp.com/guardiansofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Crater-City.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>) usually show a thin tail or ditch where the meteor first impacts which gets wider and deeper as the meteor scrapes on the ground, resulting in a final, large crater. But, the most energy a meteor imparts to the ground comes from the first instance it hits. If it were to scrape along the ground as portrayed in many movies, the crater would come from the point it hit the ground and the tail would be in the direction the meteor was traveling. The ""ditch"" or ""tail"" would get thinner and shallower as the meteor lost energy scraping across the ground. Generally the opposite is shown in movies.</p>

<p>But all that is moot anyway because meteors don't scrape along the ground at impact. That would just violate conservation of momentum and energy. You really have one of two scenarios.</p>

<ol>
<li>The meteor hits the ground with such force and energy that it mostly destroys itself and you wind up with just a crater. Such an example is the meteor crater in Arizona - in a stroke of brilliance called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_Crater"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Meteor Crater</a>. I would hazard a guess that almost all meteor impacts are of this form, be it on Earth or elsewhere.</li>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>The other option is that the meteor isn't destroyed when it hits the ground. In this case, rather than dragging or scraping on the ground, your meteor will skip like a rock on water and create another crater on its second impact. In theory, it will keep skipping until it is finally destroyed or runs out of energy. This scenario requires that the impacting meteor is hitting at a very shallow angle with very little force and generally means that it is hitting a smaller body (but larger than itself) such as an asteroid/comet/moon. An example would be the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_(crater)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Messier Crater</a> on the Moon, linked by Andy in his comment.

"Would a Phobos full impact make Mars temporary habitable?","627","","<p>Due to tidal deceleration, Phobos is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_%28moon%29#Predicted_destruction"" rel=""nofollow"">predicted</a> to be destroyed by Mars in the next 30-50 million years either by collision or by breaking up in a planetary ring. If Phobos falls on Mars in one piece could the impact could be comparable with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater#Impact_specifics"" rel=""nofollow"">Chicxulub meteorite</a>? Since Mars is smaller that Earth, would the effects of the impact cause a global restart of volcanic activity and temporary warm the planet? Would this be sufficient to make Mars more friendly to life for a few thousand years?</p>
","<p>The impact of Phobos, even in one piece (less likely), would be different from Chicxulub. Phobos is probably a little larger than the Chicxulub impactor, but much slower, and comes in almost perfectly tangential. The impact energy would be less than a 10th of the Chicxulub impact, and the energy would be distributed over a large region around the Martian equator. It wouldn't start volcanism, and it wouldn't warm Mars in a relevant way. It wouldn't make Mars more friendly to life by warming. The only noteworthy contribution to habitability would be additional organic matter which Phobos is presumed to contain.</p>

<p>Phobos will (probably) desintegrate due to tidal forces, before its fragments will collide with Mars. Any loose rocks, dust, regolith on the surface will separate from Phobos below the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit"">Roche limit</a> of
$$d=1.26~R_M\cdot\left(\frac{\rho_M}{\rho_m}\right)^\frac{1}{3},$$
with $R_M=3389.5\mbox{ km}$ the radius of Mars, $\rho_M=3.9335 \mbox{ g/cm}^3$ the mean density of Mars, and $\rho_m=1.887\mbox{ g/cm}^3$ the mean density of Phobos. This results in a Roche limit of
$$d=1.26\cdot 3389.5\mbox{ km}\cdot\left(\frac{3.9335 \mbox{ g/cm}^3}{1.887\mbox{ g/cm}^3}\right)^\frac{1}{3}=5455.6\mbox{ km}.$$
That's for Phobos' center about 2059 km above the equatorial surface of Mars (taking 3396.2 km as equatorial radius.)
Therefore desintegration will start long before the impact. Loose rocks will collide with Phobos and unlock more material. Whether there will be a considerable solid remnant to finally cause a big (tangential) impact is difficult to predict.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed"">orbital speed</a> of the fragments at the time of collision will be about
$$v_0=\frac{v_e}{\sqrt 2},$$
with $v_e=5.03\mbox{ km/s}$ the escape velocity of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars"">Mars</a>.
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_%28moon%29"">Phobos</a>' inclination of 1.093° (relative to Mars's equator) is almost neglectable for the calculation of the impact velocity.
Mars' equatorial rotation velocity is about 241.17 m/s.</p>

<p>The impact velocity will hence be about
$$\frac{5030\mbox{ m/s}}{\sqrt 2}-241.17 \mbox{ m/s}=3316\mbox{ m/s}.$$
Phobos' mass is about $1.0659\cdot 10^{16}\mbox{ kg}.$
This results in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"">kinetic impact energy</a> of
$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{1}{2}\cdot 1.0659\cdot 10^{16}\mbox{ kg}\cdot (3316\mbox{ m/s})^2=5.86\cdot 10^{22}\mbox{ J}.$$</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_fusion"">heat of fusion</a> of water is about 334 kJ/kg, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"">heat of vaporization of water</a> at 0°C is about 2504 kJ/kg, together 2838 kJ/kg are needed to evaporate water ice of 0°C.
Hence the impact energy of Phobos would be sufficient to evaporate
$$\frac{5.86\cdot 10^{22}\mbox{ J}}{2.838 \cdot 10^{6}\mbox{ J/kg}}=2.06\cdot 10^{16}\mbox{ kg}$$ of water ice of 0°C, corresponding to $2.06\cdot 10^{13}\mbox{ m}^3$ of liquid water.</p>

<p>Mars' surface area is about 144,798,500 km², or $1.447985\cdot 10^{14}\mbox{ m}^2$.
Equally distributed, we could get a layer of water ice corresponding to
$$\frac{2.06\cdot 10^{13}\mbox{ m}^3}{1.447985\cdot 10^{14}\mbox{ m}^2}=0.142\mbox{ m},$$
(correspoding to 14.2 kg/m² of liquid water) evaporated by the impact energy.</p>

<p>With a surface gravity of 3.711 m/s², this would correspond to
a pressure of $14.2 \mbox{ kg/m}^2\cdot 3.711 \mbox{ m/s}^2= 52.8 \mbox{ N/m}^2=0.528\mbox{ hPa}$.</p>

<p>The current atmospheric pressure on Mars is about 6.3 hPa, with diurnal, seasonal and regional changes.
Thus we could get a maximum of 10% short-term pressure increase in the Martian atmosphere by water vapor, in an ideal case.</p>

<p>At the end, an impact of Phobos, or its fragments, would result in a regional reworking of the Martian surface in the equatorial region, but not in a long-term global change.</p>

<p>Just melting water ice would lead to a global ocean with a depth of about 1.2 m. But this ocean would boil due to the low atmospheric pressure, and freeze out again. Same with local lakes due to the uneven topography.</p>

<p>Model calculatios with a release of carbon dioxide would cause some temporary greenhouse effect, but in the equatorial region a release of carbon dioxide is even more unlikely than a release of water vapor.</p>

"""Up"" and ""down"" in Space","621","","<p>From my understanding, ""up"" and ""down"" in space is going towards (down) an object's gravitational pull or (up) which is going away from it. I get confused with this explanation, and I believe simply because of how we perceive up and down here on earth. </p>

<p>My question(s) is this: Can we go in all directions in space with the ""Earth"" interpretation of up, down, left, right, north west, south east, etc if we can get past gravitational pulls of objects in space?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JAxMg.png"" alt=""Space Drawing""></p>

<p>Looking at my Gimp version of the universe, I have the Earth and stars. So going up would essentially be go towards any of the stars in the picture that has the strongest gravitational pull, although each object are on different planes?</p>

<p>In relation to my question above, I have imagined Earth in space as to like the 10 floor on an infinite elevator that can go in all directions. Say we can somehow go through star A and escape it's gravitational pull, we would be essentially ""going down"" right?</p>

<p>Now my other question: Are there objects in every single direction is space? How about in the Bootes void? Since it's such a massive void and there isn't much objects around to pull you in ""down"" or go away from ""up"", essentially can't we go in any direction? </p>

<p>If it may seems that my question about this is kind of confusing, I apologize because I'm confused about this myself! </p>
","<p>Your confusion is that you are treating gravity from all those objects as a bunch of discrete 'pulls' - but it doesn't manifest itself like that. Gravity from all bodies in the universe effects you as one force (I'm simplifying and excluding getting close to black holes etc where you have dramatically changing gravitational potential over the length of your body)</p>

<p>Add up all those gravitational forces and you will be pulled in a direction. It will not feel like up or down as you will just accelerate.</p>

<p>If you are in a rocket with the engine running, ""down"" will be the direction opposite to thrust. In the same way that the Earth is down, because it is pushing upwards against your feet.</p>

<p>Acceleration from your rocket engine works a lot like acceleration from the gravitational pull from a planet or star. It affects your velocity. You can go any direction - some will just be easier than others - but that is a much bigger set of questions.

"Is there any difference between rotation axis 90 degrees and 270 degrees?","617","","<p>Is there meaningful reason to distinguish 90 and 270 degree rotational axis?</p>
","<p>No, I don't believe there's any meaningful distinction.</p>

<p>A planet's axial tilt can be thought of as a 2-dimensional quantity: its angle relative to the ecliptic (or to whatever baseline you're using), and the direction in which it's tilted. When we talk about a planet's axial tilt as a number of degrees, we're only talking about the first component.</p>

<p>A planet whose rotation axis is perpendicular to the ecliptic would have a tilt of 0°. If its rotation axis is parallel to the ecliptic (rotating ""on its side""), its tilt is 90°. If its axis is ""vertical"" but it's spinning backwards, its tilt is 180°. The range from 0° to 180° is enough to express all possible tilts, both prograde and retrograde.</p>

<p>Consider taking a planet with a 0° tilt and tilting its axis by 270°. The result is exactly the same as tilting it 90° <em>in the opposite direction</em>. Since the axial tilt is usually expressed as just the magnitude of the tilt, and not its direction, the distinction between 90° and 270° can be ignored.</p>

<p>And if we want to express the direction as well, we'll just say that it's tilted 90° in some specified direction.</p>

<p>We <em>could</em> have had a convention where the tilt ranges from 0° to just under 360°, with the direction specified more narrowly, but that would be less useful; the particular direction of a planet's axial tilt is less interesting than its magnitude. Also, the direction varies over time due to precession.</p>

<p>We could also have had a convention where the tilt ranges from 0° to 90°, and we also specify whether it's retrograde or not; then Venus would have a tilt of 3° rather than 177°.</p>

<p>I would like to explain my question in more detail.</p>

<p>The greater the mass of an object, the greater the curvature of spacetime. </p>

<p>If I imagine the curvature of spacetime as a hole with a steep slope around it, I can picture that the closer I get to the center of the hole, the steeper the slope is and therefore the more I would be pushed into the center of the hole.

<p>Let's say if I stand on a bridge that covers a 20-meter-wide hole and on a bridge the covers 500-meter-wide hole. Wouldn't the gravitational force experienced be the same since the surface on both bridges is flat?</p>
","<p>The Earth doesn't <em>cover</em> the hole, the Earth <em>is</em> the hole. Gravity is an attractive force, so were you not standing on the Earth, the Earth's gravity would cause you to accelerate towards it. As you are standing on the Earth, you feel this acceleration as your weight, just as you would feel pressure if you were to push against a wall.</p>

<p>To take a more complex view, we would say that you are being attracted to the local center of gravity, which is located within the Earth. Take your bridges example, it doesn't matter that something obstructs you from reaching the center of gravity. You will feel the attraction of gravity regardless. If you jump while standing on a bridge, you would land just the same as if you jumped while standing on the ground (<em>though please try not to miss the bridge</em>). The graphic is meant to illustrate the strength of the force based on the mass of the attractive object and distance.</p>

<p>If we were to put you on a more massive object, which would have a steeper curvature, you would experience this as increased weight, which is why our lunar explorers bounced around on the moon instead of walking.</p>

","<p>Like <em>Afzaal Ahmad</em> said black holes <em>evaporate</em> through <strong>Hawking radiation</strong>, proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974. Black holes have a temperature just a little bit above absolute zero; for a black hole with the weight of the Earth it's about 0.02 K. (Such a black hole would be about 2.5 cm in diameter.) And black bodies radiate energy mainly in the form of photons as their temperature is larger, so the radiation for a black hole isn't very high: for the Earth-weigth black hole it's about $10^{-17}$ W. Larger black holes are even colder, and will radiate even less.</p>

<p>But how can the photon escape the black hole's gravity when we know light can't escape it? It happens through quantum <strong>tunneling</strong>. A photon is not just a particle, it's also a wave, and quantum mechanics shows a <strong>probability distribution</strong> for the location of a particle. The black hole's event horizon is a barrier for the photon, but it could exist beyond that barrier. Under these conditions the photon can tunnel through the event horizon and suddenly find itself outside of the black hole. (Actually tunneling <em>through</em> is not a good choice of words; the photon doesn't move through the barrier, it just suddenly is at the other side.)</p>

<p>So energy <em>can</em> and <em>does</em> radiate away from the black hole, but this happens so slowly that it may take a trillion times the age of the universe before the whole hole :-) has evaporated.</p>

"How are Galaxy Super Clusters Generated","602","","<p>I have seen pictures of clusters of galaxies, usually used in regards to theories of dark matter and galaxy formations. One of the most famous ones has the perceived shape of a stick-figure. If I am not mistaken some of these clusters seem to be bigger than our observable Universe horizon of $14$ billion light-years, which is as far as we can see because of the age of the Universe. </p>

<p>My assumption is that these are just coordinates plotted into a computer simulation. However, are these clusters the size of our observable Universe horizon or are these more theoretical abstractions?</p>

","<p>@AlexeyBobrick is correct. To add to his answer: </p>

<p>The scale of galaxy clusters are on the order of ~1Mpc (~3.14 Million light years in size), and are therefore much smaller than the cosmological horizon. </p>

<p>The cosmological principle is extraordinarily important for cosmologists, and makes the assumption about the universe's global properties (which turn out to be really good assumptions, so far): </p>

<ol>
<li>Homogeneity on the scale of about 100 Mpc. This means that one would see very little change in density within a bubble of radiua 100 Mpc as you move said bubble around the universe.</li>
<li>Isotropy means that there is no preferred directions to look. No matter where you look, you should see roughly the same picture of the universe. </li>
</ol>

<p>As for how these clusters are generated (addressing the title of your question), large N-body simulations are run over the age of the universe from different sets of initial conditions (this is where different models and assumptions come into it). These are dark matter only simulations and involve only the force of gravity. Some people are including electromagnetic interactions in their code, but it's far from being the norm, and are really only important on small scales, i.e. - inner regions of galaxies and clusters. These simulations can contain upwards of ~10 billion dark matter particles.</p>

However, why would we assume that the early martian life originated on Mars, rather than Earth?

<p>There's still a whole lot we don't know.  As Wayfaring stranger points out in the comments, Origin is a whole different question.  It's possible that life originated outside our solar system and came to either Mars and/or Earth from outside the solar-system.   I don't think anyone who studies this idea is ""Assuming"" life originated on Mars, only that the idea has a chance of being true.</p>

<p>As I understand it, volcanic eruptions are unlikely to send anything into space unless it's a smaller sized moon.   The escape velocity (young earth, maybe 10 km/s, young mars, maybe 3-4), volcanic eruptions, as far as I know, don't shoot things out at 10,000 - 20,000 MPH.   But meteor impacts of sufficient size can do that.  </p>

<p>Mars is a better meteor debris making target than the Earth cause it's smaller, so the gravity is lower and presumably it's mostly had a thinner atmosphere too.  We've found martial meteors on Earth.   We might not find any Earth meteors on mars cause it takes a much bigger impact to knock bits of rock off Earth and because the Atmosphere slows objects down, both coming in and going out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I understand that my theory has the gravity of the sun working against

</blockquote>

<p>The sun isn't as big a factor as you might think.  Once something is knocked off a planet and it gets into orbit around the sun, gravitational assists can move it around further out or further inside the solar system.  What presumably happens is that, with a big enough impact, many thousands if not millions of bits of debris get into solar-system orbit and from there, some of them land on other planets - probably much less than 1% of those hit Earth, but if it carries life that can survive the trip, all you need is one rock.</p>

<p>While that's true, the ""People used to think this was impossible"" isn't a scientific approach for what might be true.   We should determine what is possible and/or thought to be likely, based on physical evidence, not what wasn't understood 100 years ago.   Your example is a good point on why it's important to keep an open mind about the unknown.   You can still make theories based on evidence, and keep an open mind on the unknown.

"Could a cross-ringed planet exist?","598","","<p>My title doesn't do my question justice in explaining, but the kind of satellite system I'm thinking of is two rings on two separate axis, much like (if you've seen it) the film 'Treasure Planet' shown below.</p>

<p>My guess is no, as the ring of a planet matches it's axis, but I was wondering whether or not some other phenomenon or influence could cause this formation.</p>
","<p>The answer is a bit more complex than what userLTK presents.<br>
<strong>Tides</strong> play a huge role for the orientation of the rings.  </p>

<p>If the ring system has an inclination relative towards the planet, then <em>inclination damping</em> will occur.
This means that the planet, that is flattened due to its own rotation, will exert asymmetric force tugs onto orbiting masses, until the force tugs are symmetric again, which is the case for zero inclination. This works well beyond the Roche-sphere of a planet.</p>

<p>Think about Uranus ring and moon-system. </p>

<p>It seems implausible from a planetary formation viewpoint that Uranus could have an inclined subdisc from which the rings and moons formed at this inclination.</p>

","<p>It depends what parallax uncertainty you are prepared to tolerate. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at long wavelengths currently provides the most precise parallaxes.

<p>According to the review by <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2871"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reid &amp; Honma (2014)</a>, the most distant source with a VLBI-based trigonometric parallax is the star forming region W49N.

"Can we find rocks from Venus or Mercury on Earth?","596","","<p>As we know, we can find rocks from Mars on Earth, how about Venus and Mercury? Is that not found yet? Or it is impossible to find them because they are closer to the sun and derbis won't go far away from sun?</p>
","<p>You can think of it in terms of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hohmann transfer orbits</a>, which define the minimum $\Delta v$ that needs to be applied to bring something from one orbital radius to another orbital radius when orbiting a massive body. This calculation takes into account that the two objects have Keplerian orbits where the objects <em>begins</em> with at least the orbital speed of the initial orbital radius.</p>

<p>The Hohmann $\Delta v$ is given by
$$\Delta v = \sqrt{\frac{GM_{\odot}}{r_1}} \left(\sqrt{\frac{2r_2}{r_1 +r_2}} -1 \right),$$
where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the initial and final radius from the Sun.</p>

<p>Conceptually what you have to do is give a rock enough energy to escape from the planet and then give it an additional $(m/2)(\Delta v)^2$ of kinetic energy to get it to transfer into the other orbit. If the ejection speed is $v_{ej}$ then
$ v_{eg} &gt; \sqrt{(\Delta v)^2 + v_{esc}^2},$
where $v_{esc}$ is the escape velocity.  </p>

<p>The numbers for Mercury $\rightarrow$ Earth are $\Delta v = 9.2$ km/s and for Mars $\rightarrow$ Earth $\Delta v = -2.6$ km/s (you have to slow it down to allow it to fall inwards).</p>

<p>The escape velocities for these planets are 4.35 km/s and 5 km/s respectively (so almost the same).</p>

<p>This means you need to give a rock more kinetic energy to get it to Earth from Mercury as from Mars. In the case of Mars, the transfer kinetic energy is almost negligible once the rock can escape Mars' gravity. In the case of Mercury, the rock needs to be given an initial ejection velocity of $&gt; \sqrt{9.2^2 + 4.3^2}= 10.1 $ km/s. This compares with $&gt; \sqrt{2.4^2 + 5^2}= 6.5$ km/s for Mars. At lower ejection speeds most of the ejected objects will be reaccreted by the planet.</p>

<p>Against this, the leading theory to explain migration of rocks between planets is high velocity impacts. Objects falling from much further out will hit Mercury with greater speeds than Mars and impart greater energies to the ejecta.</p>

<p>A paper addressing the possibility of Mecurean meteorites was presented by <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4038"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gladman &amp; Coffey (2008)</a>. They concluded that once ejection speeds are large enough ($\sim 10$ km/s) to produce Earth-crossing ejecta, that significant accretion of meteorites should take place. Several per cent of high speed ejecta should impact the Earth (or its atmosphere at least) within 30 million years. This compares with an efficiency a factor of 2-3 higher for Mars.</p>

<p>There are various reports and speculations that at least one meteorite in existing collections (NWA7325, pictured) <em>may</em> have come from Mercury.

<p>Is there any reason why the Earth side of the Moon has enormous plains and mountains, while the far side contains just few small ones inside largest craters?</p>
","<p>The two hemispheres have distinctly different appearances, with the near side covered in multiple, large maria (Latin for 'seas,' since the earliest astronomers incorrectly thought that these plains were seas of lunar water). The far side has a battered, densely cratered appearance with few maria. Only 1% of the surface of the far side is covered by maria, compared to 31.2% on the near side. </p>

<p>One commonly accepted explanation for this difference is related to a higher concentration of heat-producing elements on the near-side hemisphere, as has been demonstrated by geochemical maps obtained from the Lunar Prospector gamma-ray spectrometer. While other factors such as surface elevation and crustal thickness could also affect where basalts erupt, these do not explain why the farside South Pole-Aitken basin (which contains the lowest elevations of the Moon and possesses a thin crust) was not as volcanically active as Oceanus Procellarum on the near side.</p>

<p>It has also been proposed that the differences between the two hemispheres may have been caused by a collision with a smaller companion moon that also originated from the Theia collision. In this model the impact led to an accretionary pile rather than a crater, contributing a hemispheric layer of extent and thickness that may be consistent with the dimensions of the farside highlands.</p>

<p>Though the far side has more visible craters, this is due to the effects of lunar lava flows, which cover and obscure craters, rather than a shielding effect from the Earth. NASA calculates that the Earth obscures only about 4 square degrees out of 41,000 square degrees of the sky as seen from the moon. ""This makes the Earth negligible as a shield for the Moon. [...] It is likely that each side of the Moon has received equal numbers of impacts, but the resurfacing by lava results in fewer craters visible on the near side than the far side, even though the both sides have received the same number of impacts.""</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F2KgF.jpg"" alt=""The moon’s centre of mass is not its geometric centre.""></p>

<p>From space craft orbiting the moon, it has been found that the centre of mass of the moon is displaced toward Earth. An explanation of seas distribution states that lunar core, aesthenosphere and the mantle is off-centre, whereas the crust is not — so the crust is thicker on the far side (see figure). Thus the basalt would reach the surface more easily on the near side due to thinner crust (to 60 km near side, 100 km far) than on the far side.</p>

<p>But I don't know how to calculate a typical resolving power in practice. How can I make this estimate taking into account astronomical seeing and other effects?</p>
","<p>The angular resolving power of a telescope is approximately $1.22 \lambda/D \times 648000/\pi$, where this is the Airy disc diameter in arcseconds, $\lambda$ is the working wavelength in metres and $D$ the diameter of the telescope primary mirror in metres. For an 8-m telescope working at 500 nm, this gives an angular resolution of 0.05 arcseconds.</p>

<p>There is then a separate question about whether this theoretical limit is ever achieved because of detector limitations or degradation by blurring due to atmospheric turbulence (seeing).</p>

<p>In practice, at visible wavelengths, seeing always trumps the intrinsic angular resolution and has a typical value of 0.5-1 arcsecond at the world's best astronomical sites. There is no set number for this. It varies with atmospheric conditions from night-to-night or even hour-to-hour. Most observatories publish statistics on this so that you can see what the mean (or median) seeing is. For instance here are some statistics for the <a href=""https://www.eso.org/gen-fac/pubs/astclim/paranal/seeing/adaptive-optics/statfwhm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Paranal (VLT)</a> site, where the median is about 0.8 arcsec.</p>

<p>Special techniques can mitigate the seeing degradation. You may have heard of adaptive optics - you can analyse the incoming wavefront and send a correcting signal to a tip-tilt or fully deformable mirror that removes the distortion, based either on an adjacent star or a laser guide star. However, these techniques are most effective in the near infrared and are not usually attempted at visible wavelengths. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics</a></p>

<p>Another method is Lucky Imaging - which can be used by amateur astronomers too. Take many pictures with short exposures. If there is a bright point source in the image somewhere, you can use this to select the best images and to shift and stack the images to produce a cleaner final product. The shorter the exposures the better this works. Very close-to the theoretical maximum resolution can be obtained in this way - but it needs a special high speed, low noise CCD and you end up throwing away more than 90% of the images.</p>

"Are the stars in constellation located in a plane or they are in different distances","588","","<p>Are the stars in constellation located in a plane or they are in different distances from each other and when we observe them from the Earth we think they are all in a plane?</p>
","<p>Constellations and asterisms are generally not proximate in space, but rather happen to be nearby only when viewed from Earth. From Wikipedia's article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy)"">asterism</a>s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like constellations, asterisms are in most cases composed of stars which, while they are visible in the same general direction, are not physically related, often being at significantly different distances from Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A recognizable example of this would be the brightest star in Taurus, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldebaran"">Aldebaran</a>.  Aldebaran appears in the V-shaped bull's head, mostly formed by stars in the Hyades star cluster. However, while those stars are actually close to one another, Aldebaran is less than half as far away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the star is located (by chance) in the line of sight between the Earth and the Hyades, it has the appearance of being the brightest member of the more scattered Hyades open star cluster that makes up the bull's-head-shaped asterism; however, the star cluster is actually more than twice as far away, at about 150 light years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, the stars of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion%27s_Belt"">Orion's belt</a> are actually hugely separated in space.</p>

<p>In addition, it's worth noting that the stars have different velocities across the sky, so the constellations will look increasingly different over long periods of time. <a href=""http://news.discovery.com/space/history-of-space/changing-constellations-50000-years.htm"">Here</a> is one prediction for 50,000 years time, and the effect will get proportionately larger as time goes on.</p>

I wonder if this is the same thing or its two entirely different principles because the names are a bit confusing to me. Can anybody please shed some light on this?</p>
","<p>I'd like to see the notion ""parallel universe"" restricted to universes similar to each other in some sense. This applies best to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation"" rel=""nofollow"">many-worlds interpretation</a> of quantum theory. Two universes in this sense can be almost identical, just different in a couple of quantum states.</p>

<p>Two such parallel universes could be interpreted (in the simplest case) as two elements of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space"" rel=""nofollow"">Hilbert space</a>. A Hilbert space defines a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space"" rel=""nofollow"">metric</a> as a measure of distance between two elements (here applied to universes).
This may be seen in some analogy to points (universes as analog) in an Euclidean plane (many-worlds multiverse as analog). Here the notion ""parallel"" can make some sense. At least, it's possible to compare the items in some way (by the distance between two points/universes).</p>

"Is it safer to be near a star or a black hole?","578","","<p>If a star or black hole neared the solar system, which would do the least damage?  For the sake of a good comparison, lets assume the candidate star is an ""average"" 5 solar mass star, and the black hole is a 5 solar mass black hole.  My thoughts at first were that the star would be the least devastating, but now that I think about it more, since not even radiation, etc... is being emitted by the black hole, (except possibly from hawking radiation and from any in falling matter), the black hole might actually be safer!</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>the candidate star is an ""average"" 5 solar mass star, and the black
  hole is a 5 solar mass black hole</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then their gravity is identical. Black holes don't have magic powers. A 5 M☉ star and a 5 M☉ black hole exert the same attraction from the same distance. The only difference is that the black hole would be much, MUCH smaller (about 30 km diameter in this case), so you could get a lot closer to the center, which is where the extreme gravity happens. But at cosmic distances they are the same.</p>

<p>Hawking radiation from a 5 M☉ black hole is negligible, likely too small to measure - its temperature is about 10^-8 Kelvin.</p>

<p>If it has an accretion disk, that might be a problem, but usually it only generates two relativistic jets at the poles - if you're not hit by the jets, you're fine.</p>

<p>The overall thermal glow from the accretion disk of a 5 M☉ black hole might be intense, but it can't last very long. It's not a continuous burn like a star, unless it's a much bigger black hole with a huge accretion disk and plenty of source material nearby to feed it - which is not the case here.</p>

<p>Your conclusion is technically correct. Gravitationally they are the same, but the star has the added problem of generating extra heat. Not that it would matter anyway, because both would completely disrupt orbits in the solar system, and the Earth is going to be flung out into space and would freeze anyway. It's just that the star would bake us first, and THEN we would freeze solid.</p>

<p>Or we would settle into a highly elliptical orbit around either the Sun or the invader body, which will have us alternately baking to death and freezing to death.</p>

<p>There is also the very tiny chance that, due to orbital disruptions, we would collide with something else, either with the invader, or with the Sun, or with another planet. This would mean a quicker death and might be overall ""preferable"".</p>

<p>Regardless, having a 5 M☉ body entering the system is not a good scenario for life on Earth.</p>

  <p>Differences in temperature, pressure and composition within the outer core cause convection currents in the molten metal as cool, dense matter sinks whilst warm, less dense matter rises. </p>

","<p>I'm not sure I agree with the double planet POV, but the calculation is pretty simple.   The earth weighs 81 moons, so for the Barycenter to be outside the earth, the distance (center of Moon to surface of earth), = 81 earth radii.  </p>

<p>But moving away 4 CM per year (same source) or 1 KM every 25,000 years, it would need 2.75 billion years to move away the necessary 110,000 KM necessary to have the barycenter move outside of earth at the moon's furthest point.  (less if the orbit gains eccentricity which is possible).   But probably more than that, cause as the moon moves away from the earth, the tidal forces that continue to push it away grow weaker and the earth slows down a little.    If the earth ever gets tidally locked with the moon, the reverse will happen and the sun's tidal forces will draw the Earth and Moon slowly towards each other, so a precise answer is too mathematically difficult for me, but longer than 2.75 billion years seems a pretty good guestimate.  </p>

<p>To me, this seems like a silly question - because the answer is really dependent on where the operator places you. Is this assumption wrong? Is there a particular place in the celestial sphere that you would be?</p>

","<p>Well, at least you did some thinking and proposed a couple of personal thoughts instead of just asking for the answer to a homework question. Both observations you make are pertinent.</p>

<p>Remember, a celestial sphere doesn't actually exist. It is an imaginary concept, a simplification based upon <em>our perspective</em> of the universe.</p>

<p>A planetarium, whether it is an old-fashioned one that depicts an earth-bound perspective of the universe, or a modern digital projection system that can ""fly"" you through space to view the universe from a different place, is projecting a perspective of the view of the universe from a particular place, that is, you see the ""celestial sphere"" as it would appear from that place. In the case of a view from elsewhere in space, it would be a different celestial sphere from <em>our</em> celestial sphere.</p>

<p>So yes, you would be at ""the centre"" of the celestial sphere. Maybe not the ""very"" centre in the case of old fashioned projectors with fixed star fields, as they wouldn't account for the 150 million kilometre imprecision caused by the movement of the earth around the sun. But, as this is an insignificant distance in astronomical terms, that doesn't matter a great deal, so ""the centre"" is probably a sufficient description.</p>

"Cosmic events as standard candles","549","","<p>Type 1a supernovae are used as standard candles. Are there other high energy cosmic events which can be used as standard candles. For example, collapse of neutron star into a black hole is also similar to type 1a.</p>

<p>In a galaxy, there are far more white dwarfs(candidates of type 1a) compared to neutron stars(I read somewhere that our galaxy contains around 200 million of them). Also, the energy released in neutron star collapse is not in visible spectrum(I don't think so that is the criteria for ""standard candles""). Are these the reasons that neutron star collapse is not qualified as another type of standard candle?</p>
","<p><sub>Intro for the uninformed: A <em>standard candle</em> is an important concept in astronomy, helping to map out distances in the Universe. Since the observed flux $F$ of a light source decreases with distance $r$ by a known factor ($r^2$), if we know its intrinsic luminosity <em>L</em>, we can calculate the distance. For large distances, where bright sources are needed, we usually use <em>supernovae</em> (SNe). But the luminosity of a SN depends on the mass of its progenitor star which is not known in general. However, for a specific type of SNe — ""type Ia"" — it <em>is</em> known: This type are SNe that explode when a white dwarf accreting mass from a companion star exceed the mass threshold for explosion of $1.4\,M_\odot$.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>In addition to the gravitational waves discussed by Rob Jeffries, I can mention the following candidates for standard candles:</p>

<h2>Type II supernovae</h2>

<p>Type Ia SNe are so similar in luminosity because they all have (almost) the same mass when they go off. But there is also evidence that type II SNe can act as standard candles. As is also to some extent the case with Ia, their lightcurves (how the luminosity changes with time) are not identical, but can be standardized using the so-called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_relationship"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Philips relation</a> (see e.g. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1590"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kasen &amp; Woosley 2009</a>).</p>

<h2>GRB supernovae</h2>

<p>Gamma-ray bursts as a whole are too diverse to be used as standard candles, but when an associated SN is detected, it becomes a standard(izable) candle (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3506"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Li &amp; Hjorth 2014</a>).</p>

<h2>Quasars</h2>

<p>My favorite candidate are <em>quasars</em>. This technique doesn't rely on the Philips relation. Quasars are caused by gas accreting onto a supermassive black hole in the center of galaxies, resulting in an ""active galactic nuclus"" (AGN) with extreme energy outputs (easily over $10^{12}\,L_\odot$, and even up to $10^{14}$–$10^{15}\,L_\odot$; <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9908052"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ibata et al. 1999</a>). It turns out that there is a correlation between the absolute luminosity of the AGN and the size of its <em>broad-line region</em> (BLR), i.e. the region around the quasar where fast-moving gas clouds absorb the continuum$^1$ of the quasar and emit lines$^2$, e.g. H$\alpha$ (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4632"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Watson et al. 2011</a>). The reason is that the size of the BLR is determined by the depth that the ionizing radiation from the quasar can penetrate into the BLR, which is proportional to the square root of the luminosity. The figure below (from Watson et al. 2011) shows the relation between distances ($D_L$) determined by this technique and distances obtained from type Ia SNe.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hW3hQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hW3hQ.png"" alt=""DL""></a></p>

<strong>Advantages over supernovae</strong>

<p>A huge advantage of quasars over SNe is that they don't disappear after a few weeks, meaning that if e.g. we want to refine some measurement, we can go back and observe it again at any time. Another advantage is that quasars, being so luminonous, can be detected out to much larger distances (roughly to $z\simeq4$) than SNe (which are only observed ut to $z\simeq2$).</p>

<strong>Reverberation mapping</strong>

<p>Since quasars are so far away, the BLR, being less than a parsec in size, cannot be resolved. But luckily, a technique call ""reverberation mapping"" allows us to determine the size:</p>

<p>The spectrum of the quasar consists of a continuum with spectral lines. Quasars vary in luminosity on rather short timescales. If we measure a quasar's luminosity regularly over some period of time, we get a so-called ""lightcurve"". But since the lines are created at a distance from the source, a given ""bump"" in the lightcurve (i.e. a temporary increase in luminosity) does't show up in the continuum and the lines at the same time. Instead, there is a delay, corresponding to the extra distance that the light had to travel from the quasar to the cloud reflecting$^3$ it.</p>

<p>In the figure below, <em>blue</em> shows the continuum, while <em>red</em> shows the lines. The lines are seen to lag behind the continuum, since they first had to travel from the quasar (<em>black</em>) to the clouds (<em>magenta</em>).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wFL0M.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wFL0M.png"" alt=""reflect""></a></p>

<p>Since the clouds lie at a range of distances, they exhibit different time lags, effectively broadening the line:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PGYwc.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PGYwc.png"" alt=""lightcurve""></a></p>

<p>So, in the figure above, showing observed flux as a function of time, the light in the <em>line</em> increased in luminosity roughly 1.5 days later than the light in the <em>continuum</em>. This means that the BLR is roughly 1.5 lightdays (or ~250 AU) in radius.</p>

"Why is there a difference between the cosmic event horizon and the age of the universe?","549","","<p>According to wiki the cosmic event horizon is 5 Gpc but the age of the universe is about 13,7 billion years. Usually light from far galaxys needed at most 13,7 billion years to reach the earth so the event horizon should be the same. But in wiki the event horizon is 5*3,2billionly=16 billion ly. So is this difference just a matter of rounding or old data or is there something else what causes the differences?</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon#Event_horizon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon#Event_horizon</a></p>
","<p>From the link you provide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The particle horizon differs from the cosmic event horizon, in that the particle horizon represents the largest comoving distance from which light could have reached the observer by a specific time, while the event horizon is the largest comoving distance from which light emitted now can ever reach the observer in the future. The current distance to our cosmic event horizon is about 5 Gpc, well within our observable range given by the particle horizon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your confusion somes from the fact that you are mixing to different horizons:</p>

<p>The <strong>particle horizon</strong> is the sphere centered on us that has a radius equal to the distance that light can travel in 13.8 Gyr (the age of the Universe). That is, light that was <em>emitted when the Universe was born</em> at a point on that horizon, reaches us today. Note that, because the Universe is expanding, the distance is not 13.8 Gly, or 4.2 Gpc, as one might naively expect, but in fact 47 Gly.</p>

<p>The <strong>cosmic event horizon</strong> is also a sphere centered on us, which holds all points from which light, if it is <em>emitted today</em>, it will reach us in the future. If it is emitted outside this horizon, the expansion of the Universe ensures that the light will never reach us.</p>

<p>As time goes, we will see light that came from farther and farther away, and thus the distance to the particle horizon is <em>in</em>creasing. Meanwhile, the accelerating expansion of the Universe ensures that light emitted from distant galaxies in the future are able to reach us only if they are increasingly closer. Thus the distance to the event horizon is <em>de</em>creasing.</p>

<p>You can see the particle and the event horizons as blue and red lines in the plot in <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/24142/pulsar"">@Pulsar</a>'s great answer <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/60519/can-space-expand-with-unlimited-speed/63780#63780"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The 16 Gly that the distance to the event horizon is today is sort of a coincidence. It has nothing to do with the age of the Universe. It only depends on the future expansion of the Universe, which in turn depends on the densities of the components of the Universe ($\Omega_\mathrm{b},\Omega_\mathrm{DM},\Omega_\Lambda$, etc.). If the Universe has been dominated by matter (or radiation), then there would be no event horizon: No galaxy, ever-so far away would <em>not</em> be visible to us, if we just had the patience to wait. A galaxy is 10,000 billion lightyears away? Just wait long enough (exactly how long depends on the actual density).</p>

<p>However, our Universe happens to be dominated by dark energy, which accelerates the expansion without boundaries. This unfortunately means that the light leaving today from a galaxy 17 Gly away will be carried away by the expansion faster than it can travel toward us. In contrast, the light emitted today from a galaxy 15 Gly away will travel in our direction, but will nonetheless initially move away from us due to the expansion. However, its journey toward us makes this expansion rate smaller and smaller (since the expansion rate increases with distance from us), and after a period of time it will have traveled so far that it has overcome expansion and starts decreasing its distance from us and eventually reach us after 100 Gyr or so.</p>

<p>d)According to our understanding of stellar evolution, black holes should make up a much higher percentage of the galaxy's mass. </p>

<p>In my own understanding, I feel like it should be a). Since the black holes are forming all the time, I think it is hard to detect all of them. But I am not quite sure, could someone give any insight?</p>
","<p>(a) We can't detect ALL of <em>anything</em>, but we can certainly makes estimates of their integral properties.

We have also observed a tiny fraction of the stellar black holes in our galaxy - those few examples that have revealed themselves through their binary companions.</p>

<p>(b) Yes we do. It is just over 4 million solar masses and thus a negligible fraction of the Galaxy's total mass.</p>

<p>(c) and (d) It is not just stellar evolution that is involved, it is the distribution of stellar birth masses (the initial mass function) that needs to be known, possibly as a function of time.</p>

<p>The stellar evolution part has a major uncertainty in that although it is reasonably certain that all stars above about 10 solar masses end their lives in supernovae, it is not certain what fraction will leave black hole remnants. This is probably a strong function of mass - higher masses favour a black hole and progenitor metallicity; low metallicity stars lose less mass during their lives and are more likely to directly collapse to a black hole - see <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212469"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Heger et al. (2003)</a>.</p>

<p>You can do a back of the envelope calculation. Suppose the IMF has the Saltpeter form $N(M)\propto M^{-2.35}$ between 0.1 and 100 solar masses. Further assume that: because a 1 solar mass star has a lifetime of 10 billion years, the age of the Galaxy is 10 billion years and the stellar lifetime is a very strong inverse function of mass $(\propto M^{-2.5})$, that the 100 billion stars that we deduce exist in our Galaxy (by counting up the local stars and measuring stellar densities elsewhere and extrapolating) are predominantly all the 0.1 to 1 solar mass stars that have <em>ever</em> been born. This allows us to then estimate how many stars have been born in any mass range - even if they have long-since died.</p>

<p>So making the above assumptions, I will make the further assumption that all stars from 20-100 solar masses die and leave a black hole remnant.Then if my maths is correct then there are about $10^{11}/1400 \sim 7\times 10^{7}$ black holes in our Galaxy. That is there is 1 black hole for every 1400 stars of 0.1-1 solar mass.</p>

<p>The remaining parts of the puzzle are what is the mass of a typical black hole and what is the mass of the Galaxy? A good number for the former is about 10 solar masses, since the black hole binaries appear to cluster at this value or a little lower (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04757"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ozel et al. 2010</a>). The latter is still a topic of investigation. It appears to be an order of magnitude bigger than all the stars, gas and dust due to some form of dark matter. Let's use the number $7\times 10^{11}$ solar masses (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04757"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eadie &amp; Harris 2016</a>).</p>

<p>So my final number is that black holes form $7\times 10^{7}\times 10/7\times 10^{11} = 0.1$ percent of the Milky Way mass.</p>

<p>You could push this number up by a factor of a few by assuming that the IMF contained more higher mass stars in the past, or that the threshold mass for black hole production was lower in the past for low metallicity stars.

<p>You are overestimating the size and the capabilities of a supermassive black hole. Contrary to pop sci portrayals of black holes, black holes are not giant vacuum cleaners in space that suck up anything and everything close by. While the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way is indeed very massive (about four million times the mass of our Sun), it isn't very large physically. It's less than a couple dozen solar diameters across. It also isn't that hungry, gobbling up perhaps the equivalent of four or so Earth masses over the course of a year.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the central bulge of a spiral galaxy contains several million stars in a fairly small volume. That central bulge is what you are seeing in those images.

<p>I know there would be total destruction everywhere, but I would like to know what, including more scientific short- and long- term effects, would happen?</p>

<p>If you can't explain three stars, two stars colliding would be okay. I'm still an amateur at astronomy, so please don't make the answer too complicated.</p>
","<p>The collision of another star with our sun would be a very effective way of ending all life on Earth. Fortunately stars are so far apart that the the chance of it happening in the life of the sun is very close to zero.</p>

<p>However in the densely packed cores of globular clusters the rate of collision is much higher, and there may be a collision somewhere in the milkyway once every 10000 years or so. Three way collisions don't happen (or are exceptionally unlikely) but would be similar to two two-star collisions.</p>

<p>The result varies depending on the size of the stars, their density, the relative velocity, and whether a collision is head on or not. Generally a denser star is likely to come out of a collision in better shape. So a red giant, could have most of its very rarified outer layers pulled off and the core escaping.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if two main sequence stars, like our sun, collide, they first compress each other. Some of the stellar envelope escapes perpendicular to the collision (think of jam being squeezed out of a sandwich). But within a few hours the two stars have mixed and merged, and   a new, larger star formed.</p>

<p>The mixing adds lots more hydrogen to the core of the star, which causes it to rejuventate. The first evidence of stellar collisions is in globular clusters, in which there are some large blue stars that seem younger than all the other stars in the cluster (Blue stragglers)</p>

<p>A white dwarf and main sequence star collision is bad news for the star. The collision causes the core of the star to heat up and a massive release of thermonuclear energy. Plenty more than is needed to completely disrupt the star. The star is completely destroyed in the process. However the white dwarf is relatively unscathed.</p>

<p>The planets in the solar systems have orbits with pretty low <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity#Examples"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eccentricities</a> (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitationally_rounded_objects_of_the_Solar_System"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> for more eccentricity values). At the upper end is Mercury, with an eccentricity of 0.2056. At the lower end is Venus, at 0.00677. Earth is in between but moderately low, at 0.0167. The distance between <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion_and_aphelion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">perihelion and aphelion</a> is 5 million kilometers - in an orbit with an average radius of about 150 million kilometers. Note, though, that eccentricities are always changing.</p>

<p>We would certainly have ""seasons"" if there was no axial tilt, but they most likely would not be dramatic. As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion_and_aphelion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of the increased distance at aphelion, only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given area of land as does at perihelion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#Elliptical_Earth_orbit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> page, it says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Orbital eccentricity can influence temperatures, but on Earth, this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors; research shows that the Earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when farther from the sun. This is because the northern hemisphere has more land than the southern, and land warms more readily than sea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So more land means that the planet can absorb heat better, which counteracts the change in distance.</p>

<p>But I think that's pretty boring. Don't you? So let's calculate how eccentric Earth's orbit would have to be for it to have seasons without axial tilt. From the chart <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#Modern_mid-latitude_meteorological"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> we can see that the highest average hemispherical temperature is 22 degrees Celsius, while the lowest is 8 degrees Celsius. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2nptu.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2nptu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What about other planets?</p>

<p>There's a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitationally_rounded_objects_of_the_Solar_System#Planets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">steady downward trend</a> as we get further away from the Sun (Venus is an exception because of its runaway greenhouse effect). For Earth, the average surface temperature is 287 K (15 degrees C). So our maximum would be 295 K and our minimum would be about 281 K (Kelvin = Celsius + 273). Compare that to the other planets.</p>

<p>I made a graph, which unfortunately I cannot paste here, that shows that to have a surface temperature of 295 K, the planet would have to be - well, not much closer than we are. Relatively, that is. Roughly 0.975 AU from the star. To have a surface temperature of 281 K, it would have to be at 1.05 AU from the star. This neglects, by the way, the different levels of land/sea absorption.</p>

<p>So, actually, if the Earth's orbit had an eccentricity of about 0.35, it could have some moderate seasons.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Note: I used <a href=""http://www.1728.org/ellipse.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> eccentricity calculator for the sake of accuracy and time. I would still be obliged if anyone could check my overall calculations for this answer.</p>

"Does natural satellite(s) of a planet affects its orbital velocity around a star?","540","","<p>Please excuse me for a lay question. </p>

<p>As we know, to calculate the orbital velocity, we take the mass of the orbiting body, the mass of the body being orbited and the distance between the two bodies into account. </p>

<p>However, we don't really care about the natural satellite(s) (of a planet) in the calculations. Why are they insignificant? Why isn't the whole system involved in the calculations?</p>
","<p>Yes, it does affect the planet's orbital velocity. Both planet and satellite move around the planet-satellite center of mass. That center of mass is orbiting the star with some constant velocity (let's assume circular orbits to keep things simple) but if you're only looking at the planet, then the orbital speed around the star will wobble up and down around the because of its additional motion around the planet-satellite center of mass.</p>

<p>For most planet-satellite systems this effect is very small since usually the satellite is very, very light compared to the planet. Only when you have a genuine double system like Earth-Moon or Pluto-Charon does this effect start to matter. For transiting exoplanet systems they're trying to infer the existence of exomoons by exploiting the effect this will have on the transit timing of the planet. So far no exomoons have turned up though.</p>

","<p>Star temperature is an interesting question since temperature varies a lot in a star. I think that the more relevant temperature to this question is the core temperature of the star: a star is born when it starts to burn hydrodgen in its core.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, hydrogen begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest
  of the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar

<p>(See this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation#Protostar"">Wikipedia page</a>)</p>

<p>The temperature needed for hydrodgen burning is <strong>10 million Kelvin</strong>, so that's how hot a star must be to be considered as a star.

"Why is Enceladus the only geologically active moon among its neighbours?","539","","<p>My understanding of why Enceladus is geologically active is that tidal forces from Saturn and - to a lesser extent - from the nearby larger moon Dione provide heat to the moon's interior, just like Jupiter does for Io. </p>

<p>Should the other mid-to-large-sized moons Mimas, Tethys, Dione and Rhea not also exhibit similar activity from the same forces? Granted, Dione and Rhea are further from Saturn and thus less susceptible to tidal stresses, but what about Tethys and Mimas? What special attributes does Enceladus possess that has allowed it to be geologically active in modern times? Is it purely down to the fact that the interior of Enceladus is more ice than rock compared to the other moons, or are there more factors to consider?</p>
","<p>This puzzle is something called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus#Mimas.E2.80.93Enceladus_paradox"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Mimas paradox</em></a>. The two bodies are nearly twins, but Mimas is substantially less active than Enceladus. There are currently several proposed solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2015/EGU2015-10569.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mimas cooled quickly</a>, before it entered its resonance with Tethys (which contributes to tidal heating, just as Dione does for Enceladus). <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus#Radioactive_heating"" rel=""noreferrer"">A ""hot start""</a> from rapid radioactive decay (of <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6445323.stm"" rel=""noreferrer"">aluminum-26 and iron-60</a>) shortly after Enceladus' formation could have allowed its subsurface ocean to stay liquid.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/2200.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Enceladus is rockier</a> and therefore has a higher density. This would have led to quicker cooling, and would also mean that tidal dissipation could be higher for Enceladus than for Mimas. It does seem a bit paradoxical - one would imagine that more rock would mean less water ice and therefore a smaller subsurface ocean - but this isn't a problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's worth noting that Tethys is thought to be made almost entirely of ice. If the rocky-Enceladus hypothesis is true, then that could be a major factor in the lack of geological activity on Tethys. However, Tethys likely once had a subsurface ocean. Dione currently does, and experiences tidal heating; however, its semi-major axis is large enough that the effects are not as strong as on Enceladus.</p>

"Mars night sky - how many stars visible?","536","","<p>How would the night sky look like from the Martian surface?</p>

<p>Would there be more stars visible or less (compared to Earth)?</p>

<p>Would they appear brighter/dimmer/same?</p>
","<p>I'll add to Wayfaring Stranger's comments. In fact most of the time you would be able to see <em>fewer</em> stars in the night sky of Mars, than in a good dark night sky on Earth, because of dust obscuration.</p>

<p>Even in favourable conditions, the optical depth of the Martian atmosphere is usally somewhere between 0.5 and 1 per airmass. (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063311002960"">Petrova et al. 2012</a>; <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4234"">Lemmon et al. 2014</a>) and is nearly wavelength independent. This corresponds to a reduction in flux to between 37% and 60% of its value above the atmosphere. This compares to a typical optical (V-band) extinction of around 0.1 magnitude at a good site on Earth, which allows 90% of the flux through.  There are times when it can be much worse than this on Mars.</p>

<p>This means that the limiting magnitude on Mars would be somewhere between 0.44 and 0.96 magnitudes brighter than it is on a dark site on Earth and that all the stars would be fainter by these values.</p>

<p>As a rough guide to the effect this has I took the Hipparcos catalogue and made a frequency histogram of V-magnitude of the stars. If we define a Hipparcos magnitude of 6 as the limit you can see from a good dark site on Earth, then you would see 4559 stars (that's over the whole of the sky in both hemispheres). If that limit was reduced to 5.56 or 5.04, then this number decreases to 2745 or 1560 respectively. Thus there would be a <em>reduction</em> in the number of stars you could see by typically between a factor of 1.66 and 2.92.</p>

"Could there be dark matter black holes?","533","","<p>Could dark matter compress and form black holes? Since dark matter is even more abundant than normal matter, a dark matter black hole should not be rare...right?</p>
","<p>The problem with trying to form a black hole with dark matter is that dark matter can only weakly interact (if at all) with normal matter and itself, other than by gravity.</p>

<p>This poses a problem. To get dark matter concentrated enough to form a black hole requires it to increase its (negative) gravitational binding energy <em>without</em> at the same time increasing its internal kinetic energy by the same amount. This requires some sort of dissipative interaction between dark matter and normal matter (or itself).</p>

<p>The following scenario should make this clear. Suppose we have a lump of dark matter that gravitationally attracts another lump of dark matter. As the two approach each other, they accelerate and gain kinetic energy. The kinetic energy gained will be exactly enough to then separate them to a similar degree to which they started, <em>unless</em> some dissipative process takes place.</p>

<p>An example is to suppose that dark matter is weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). WIMPs are gravitationally drawn towards the centres of stars. If the weak interactions happen sufficiently frequently then it <em>might</em> be possible for them to accumulate in stars, rather than shoot through and out the other side.</p>

<p>It has been hypothesised that black holes could be made like this near the centre of a Galaxy, seeded by dense neutron stars. The density of neutron star matter, combined with the enhanced density of dark matter near galaxy centres <em>could</em> result in dark matter accumulation in the neutron stars, leading to the formation of black holes.</p>

<p>Once a black hole is formed then any dark matter that enters the event horizon cannot emerge regardless of what kinetic energy it gains in the process. However, there is still a problem. Material in orbit around a black hole has <em>less</em> angular momentum the closer it orbits. To pass inside the event horizon requires the dark matter to lose angular momentum. Normal matter does this via an accretion disc that can transport angular momentum outwards by viscous torques, allowing matter to accrete. Dark matter has almost zero viscosity so this can't happen.</p>

<p>So building a supermassive black hole from a smaller seed would be difficult, but forming small black holes out of neutron stars might be easier. It has been proposed that a relative lack of pulsars observed towards our own Galactic centre <em>could</em> be due to this process. </p>

","<p>Since the astronomers are using radio telescopes and not optical telescopes, I'd like to point out why they are doing so - The centre of the Milky Way is a <em>very</em> dusty place. Wavelengths from the millimeter to optical get easily absorbed by all this dust, so it's very difficult to see the centre of the galaxy in the optical spectrum. But radio waves do not get absorbed, and the centre of our galaxy is a very strong source of radio waves. Therefore looking in radio will give us the clearest picture of what's happening over there.</p>

<p>The images you get from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLBI"">VLBI</a> aren't images in the traditional sense, like you would get from an optical telescope.

"How do you define the diameter of the Sun","527","","<p>That is, it's twice the radius where the radius is from the centre of the sun to some edge. But what is that edge?</p>
","<p>Fusion reactions taking place inside the core of the star produce a huge amount of energy, most of which becomes heat. These reactions are not evenly distributed through the star and so there are phenomena such as sun spots and solar flares, however the total amount of energy produced tends to be reasonably constant.</p>

<p>I would say that the edge is defined by the average point where the gravity reaches equilibrium with the pressure of the star's super-heated gases (as a result of internal fusion).</p>

<p>See the picture of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sun on Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>That edge/balance will change when the sun begins to run low on hydrogen. At this time, the reactions inside the star will change causing it to become become a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#After_core_hydrogen_exhaustion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">giant red star</a>. </p>

<p>Along with scattering, there is also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air#Refractive_index"">refraction</a> which can be especially problematic when combined with atmospheric turbulence.

"Does anyone know why three of Jupiter's largest moons orbit in 1:2:4 resonance?","526","","<p>Three of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons"">first four moons</a> ever discovered outside of our own planetary sphere of gravitational influence orbit in very close to perfect resonance. Europa's orbit is almost exactly twice as long as Io's, and Ganymede's is almost exactly twice as long as Europa's. Perhaps it is just coincidence. If you look at enough random things, you start to see patterns that aren't necessarily there. But it would be a pretty big coincidence. When I see something like this in nature, I have to wonder if there is an underlying cause.</p>

<p>The ratios aren't quite exactly 2, so if there is a gravitational influence or something that pulls them into this resonance, the influence must not be overpowering enough to force exact resonance. Or maybe it is, given enough time, but ""recent"" collisions or the pull of other satellites in the system may have driven them a little bit off of their resonance. Has anyone studied this and found a probable reason for this phenomenon?</p>
","<p>When the Galilean moons formed, they weren't in resonance with each other. All of them were in slightly smaller orbits than they are now. Over time after their formation, Io's orbit slowly moved outward due to tides from Jupiter. This is the same effect that is causing our moon to slowly move away from the Earth (at about the same rate your fingernails grow). It goes like this. The Moon's gravity causes tides to form in Earth's oceans. This bulge of water gets carried forward with Earth's rotation, because the Earth is spinning faster than the Moon is orbiting. Because the moon is still attracting the bulge, it causes a drag on the Earth, slowing its spin. At the same time, the bulge is attracting the moon, causing it to go faster in its orbit. As the moon speeds up, its orbit gets bigger. So essentially, the Earth's spin energy is getting transferred into the Moon's orbital energy. The same thing happens with Jupiter and Io, with a bulge in Jupiter's atmosphere causing Io's orbit to get bigger.</p>

<p>As Io's orbit expanded, its 'year' got longer, until it approached a 2/1 resonance with Europa. Once they reached resonance, they got 'locked in', their mutual gravity acting on each other reinforced it. Io was still raising tides on Jupiter, though, and its orbit was still trying to expand. As Io's orbit kept expanding, it gave a gravitational kick to Callisto on each pass, expanding both of their orbits until Callisto reached a 2/1 resonance with Ganymede. This is where the inner 3 Galilean moons got their resonance. The orbits are still expanding, but much more slowly because with each one you add on, it gets harder to transfer the energy. Given enough time, all 4 Galilean moons would probably reach resonance, although the sun will die before that happens.</p>

<p>I may have some of the minor details wrong here, but this is the story as I understand it.</p>

"How did Jupiter form where it is?","524","","<p>Since Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system and is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium, (the gases the Sun uses to create energy), how come it didn't form as far out as say Uranus or Neptune since when our star formed it took most of the gases around it to create? Just a little confused on this, thanks for the help! </p>
","<p>It's at Jupiter's distance and beyond that ices were able to form out of the disk of material surrounding the early sun.  Go much further in and there is too much energy from the sun for them to stay as solids (and will sublimate into gases); this is why asteroids are principally rocks and metals.  So at this distance more of the materials of the planetary disk can form the base planetesimals. </p>

<p>At this point, your question is answered largely by a geometric consideration (or two) and one of Kepler's laws.</p>

<p>First, the geometric consideration.  A circle of radius $r$ has area $\pi r^2$.  The bigger the radius, the more area.  The material for Jupiter (or any other planet) came from an annulus: stuff outside one circle, but inside a slightly bigger circle.  This annulus had a lot more area for the out planets than the inner planets, and so could contain a lot more mass.</p>

<p>Of course, that could makes us think that Jupiter shouldn't be the largest of the gas giants: it's the closest of them all to the sun, after all.   The density of the disk needn't have been approximately constant throughout these regions, though.  Quite possibly the density was such that Jupiter's region had more mass than the areas for the other planets.  As HDE's answer (posted as I was finishing this) points out, these ices probably also helped stop materials from passing into the inner solar system, maintaining a higher density than you might otherwise expect in the inner solar system, as well as causing materials to sort of ""dam up"" right around Jupiter's orbit.</p>

<p>Now for the Kepler's law.  The further you get from the sun, the slower your orbital period.  Picking the correct units, we have $P^2=a^3$, where $P$ is the period measured in years, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit measured in AU.  The further out you go, the slower you go around the sun; indeed, it's not just that it takes you a longer total time, but your actual velocity goes down.  We can also see this as a Newton's law of gravity consequence.  At Jupiter's furthest point from the Sun, the escape velocity is a little more than 18 km/s.  At Saturn's maximum distance, the escape velocity drops to around 13.25 km/s.  So things can go roughly 35% faster within Jupiter's orbit than they can closer to Saturn's, and they have less distance to travel to make a complete orbit.</p>

<p>What this means is that it takes longer for planetesimals to get close enough to each other to accrete together the further out you go, and there is a longer mean time between collisions.  </p>

<p>Now, eventually, the Sun ""turned on"" and started blasting space with it's solar wind (before that, the heat came primarily from thermal radiation from the gravitational contraction of the sun).  This ended up clearing out most of the unaccreted particles out of the solar system, stopping planetary growth (and removed portions of existing atmospheres; a very young Earth probably had a lot of H and He in its atmosphere, until the sun hit it with enough energy to knock any of it not locked up in rocks away).</p>

<p>So Jupiter was probably in a bit of a goldilocks situation.  The average density of the region it formed in was probably higher than where the other giants formed in, it was at the perfect spot for lots of materials to start accreting early, and the accretion process would have been faster.  So Jupiter is growing faster, and this gives it a competitive advantage: the bigger the growing planetesimals get the further their influence extends and the faster they can pull in more materials, and subsequently interfere with the growth of other planets (or planetesimals).  Somewhere around a mass of 10-15 earth masses, the giants can start pulling in large quantities of the hydrogen and helium gasses.  And, again, Jupiter likely hit this mass well before the other giants, and had more material to pull from, so it became much larger than the others could before the solar wind stopped the process.</p>

Is these events frequent, evenly distributed and lasting enough for astronomers to measure any place in our observable universe? Is this method of measurement more preferable than others currently?does this method had any limitations such as an absent of supernova nearby?</p>
","<p>Type Ia supernovae are not common; they are quite rare events, happening maybe once per 100-200 years in a big galaxy. Nevertheless they have two properties that make them fantastically useful for distance measurement.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They are (very close to) ""standard candles"". The physics of the supernova detonation, thought to be when a white dwarf accretes matter and exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, is very ""standardised"". The bomb goes off in exactly the same way with the same amount of identical explosive. That means to a good approximation, measuring the <em>apparent</em> brightness of a type Ia supernova and comparing it with nearby examples means that the distances to these events can be accurately estimated.</p></li>
<li><p>They are really luminous and last 2-3 weeks. This means that they can be seen at enormous distances, they almost outshine the galaxies that they are in, and they last long enough for astronomers to discover them in automated surveys and still have time to follow them up and measure their light curves and estimate their peak brightness.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The limitations are that you can't choose which galaxies you measure the distance to. You have to wait for a supernova to go off and that might take 100-200 years or more for a particular galaxy. There are also continuing debates about just how standard a candle these objects are. It is possible that more distant galaxies that we see in the very early universe made stars with a different composition (far less elements heavier than helium) and that this alters things a bit. Other problems are associated with ""de-reddening"" the supernova light curves to account for the possibility of obscuring dust in the host galaxy. It is also possible that there is more than one way to produce a type Ia supernova (accretion of additional mass or merger of two white dwarfs).</p>

<p>I am puzzled by your question ""Why can't the distances between our Sun and the celestial objects be measured directly?"". Galaxies are much too far away to have a trigonometric parallax distance. Methods like using Cepheids or RR Lyrae variables don't work for very distant galaxies because we can't resolve the individual stars. You could estimate a distance using a measurement of redshift and a cosmological model for the expansion of the Universe, but really the point of using these supernovae was and is to <em>test</em> and <em>improve</em> the cosmological models.</p>

"Inflation cosmology: slow-roll inflation versus tunneling between two vacua","522","","<p>In slow-roll inflation models, the early inflation of the universe is driven by the flat non-zero part of the inflaton potential, and it ends as the ball rolls down the cliff and the potential energy released leads then to the formation of matter.</p>

<p>However, as I have heard such slow-roll models are no longer deemed realistic today in inflationary cosmology, instead other models where the end of the inflation is explained by quantum tunneling of the universe from a state with higher vacuum energy density to another state with lower vacuum energy density are considered for example.</p>

<p>Why (from a physical point of view) are slow-roll inflation models no longer considered to be realistic, what are their disadvantages? What can models that explain (the end of) the early inflation by a tunneling transition between to vacua explain or describe, that slow roll models can not do?</p>
","<p>I...think you've got it backwards? Slow-roll inflation is alive and well, unlike models which involve tunneling between two vacua. The model of inflation first proposed by Alan Guth back in 1980 was a tunneling model. But it had a serious problem: it didn't <em>reheat</em>. Tunneling from a false vacuum to a true one (or a lower-energy false one) wouldn't release any radiation. And we need that radiation, because we <em>are</em> that radiation, cooled down and condensed after nearly 14 billion years of expansion. The solution was slow-roll inflation: as you mentioned in your question, rolling down the potential well releases a great deal of energy, which in turn leads to the wide variety of matter and radiation in the universe today. Slow-roll inflation also does a nice job of predicting the tiny density fluctuations in the early universe that seeded the formation of all the structures in the universe. Wikipedia has <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_%28cosmology%29#Early_inflationary_models"">more on all of this</a>.</p>

If Pluto were in a near-circular orbit larger than Neptune's (at about 33 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit"" rel=""nofollow"">AU</a>), there is a high chance that Neptune could capture Pluto and lock it an orbital resonance (this probably happened when Neptune was at about 25 AU).

"How Much Overlap Will the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way Have When They Collide?","519","","<p>Measurements of Andromeda's blue shift let us conclude that the distance between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way is decreasing and in a few billion years they will ""collide"".</p>

<p>The blue shift only yields the radial component of Andromeda's velocity vector. It is my understanding that measuring the tangential component is crucial in determining whether a ""collision"" will actually happen (in a gravitationally bound two body system, for point-like bodies to collide, the relative velocity component must point <em>exactly</em> towards the other body, i.e. the tangential component must vanish).</p>

<p>Now, galaxies are not point-like, so some small nonzero tangential component might lead to a collision where at least some galaxy arms intersect.</p>

<p>Has the tangential velocity been measured? If so, how? How central is the collision (bulge into bulge, bulge into arms, arms into arms)?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://astrobites.org/2012/06/01/the-fate-of-the-milky-way/"">This page</a>, from June 2012, contains a fairly detailed summary of three papers that considered the tangential velocity and collision problem.  I'll quote a few choice bits from that page:</p>

<blockquote>Andromeda (M31) and the Milky Way are the two largest galaxies in the small group of galaxies called the Local Group. At the moment, M31 is about 770 kpc away from our galaxy, but Doppler measurements of the line-of-sight velocites of its stars have long shown that it is inexorably falling toward us. The exact nature of the collision, however, has so far remained unkwnon. Will it be a miss, glancing blow, or head-on smashup? This depends on the proper motion (sideways motion) of Andromeda in the sky, which is extremely hard to measure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At last, the authors of this study manage to collect extraordinarily accurate Hubble Space Telescope observations of the tangential motion of M31 over a five-to seven-year period, and these data remove any doubt that Andromeda is destined to strike and merge with our Milky Way in four billion years. The Triangulum galaxy M33, the third most massive galaxy of the Local group, which is bound to M31, will likely join in the cosmic boom (with a small chance that M33 will hit the Milky Way first).</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The final result is that M31 has a radial velocity with respect to the Milky Way of about  -109 km/s, and a tangential velocity of about 17.0 km/s (&lt;34.3 km/s at 1-sigma confidence). These numbers clearly imply that the velocity vector of Andromeda Galaxy is statistically consistent with a radial (head-on collision) orbit towards the Milky Way. This means that the Milky Way-M31 system is bound, and that the two galaxies will merge, as investigated further in Paper III.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The simulations show that the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy will merge, consistently with the radial (head-on collision) orbit deduced in Paper II for M31, and  that the first “pericenter” (closest approach) will occur at around 4 Gyr from now. For our Milky Way,  the encounter has 72.2% probability of being prograde (the galaxy spins in the same direction as the flyby). In 41.0% of the Monte-Carlo orbits M31 makes a direct hit with our Milky Way, where the authors define a “direct hit” as an encounter with a first pericenter distance less than 25 kpc. The two galaxies will eventually merge after 5.9 Gyr, and the radial mass profile of the merger remnant will be significantly more extended than the original individual profiles. Roughly speaking, this profile will follow the $R^{1/4}$ law characteristic of elliptical galaxies, in agreement with the predictions from the numerical simulations of major mergers of spiral galaxies.</blockquote>

<p>I'll note that $25 \text{ kpc} = 25,000 \text{ pc} \cong 81,540 \text{ ly}$, and that the Milky Way is only about 100,000 ly in diameter, so the ""direct hit"" definition is quite a substantial distance here.</p>

"Can we see the Big Bang happen if we look far enough?","517","","<p>The observable universe is constantly expanding as more light from the Big Bang reaches us. This light has been travelling for billions of years, so we are looking at the universe as it was a few billion years ago. This being said, would it be possible to look at the Big Bang in action by looking deep into the universe?</p>
","<p><strong>No.</strong> The furthest we can see is the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). Early on (after the big bang), matter was fully ionised and the electrons frequently interacted with the photons. That has two consequences. First, the radition was that of a blackbody at the same temperature as the matter. Second, the universe was opaque, i.e. photons couldn't travel very far. 
Due to the explosive expansion of the universe, the temperature decreased all the time until eventually atoms formed. This is called the epoch of re-combination, though the ""re"" makes little sense. At that point the universe became suddenly transparent and we can see most radiation emitted ever since. In particular the radiation field from the epoch of recombination has been redshifted and appears to us as the CMB.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>
To answer the speculation in the comments what if the universe was not opaque. Well, all we would be able to so is some (nearly) isotropic radiation field emitted very early on (and redshifted by the cosmic expansion since the big bang). The CMB is exactly that, but emitted at redshift $z\sim$1000 (the epoch of re-combination) rather than larger $z$.</p>

<p>Update: to those asking about which stars to consider, just choose e.g. the canonical 7 stars of each.

"How can a planet have a 90° inclination?","515","","<p>Planetary systems as we understand it exist from a disk of mass when the parent star is young.  That's why all our planets are in the same plane, or close to it.  See also <em><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/2224/1462"">Why is the solar system often shown as a 2D plane?</a></em>,  <em><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/6001/1462"">Inclination of planets</a></em>, and answers there.</p>

<p>Yet the newly announced <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-452b"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kepler-452b</a> apparently has an inclination of close to 90° (89.806+0.134−0.049°).  Do we have any model of solar system formation that explains how this can form?</p>
","<p>As <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> notes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the word 'inclination' is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination then the angle between the planet's orbit and the star's rotation must use a different word and is termed the spin-orbit angle or spin-orbit alignment. In most cases the orientation of the star's rotational axis is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of now (7/26/2015), no other planets, smaller objects, or debris disks have been found around Kepler-452. This means that the situation is not as unusual as might be thought. If there were other planets in the system with orbital inclinations near 0°, then things would appear exceedingly odd. Why would this one planet be different than the others?</p>

<p>One possible scenario is that the star's rotation axis has been changed. Think about how Uranus's axial tilt is skewed. Nobody knows for sure what happened, though one popular theory is that it was hit at some point in time by another object. Granted, it would take a rather large object to have any effect whatsoever on the axial tilt of Kepler-452, but it is still possible.</p>

<p>The point of this idea is that perhaps it is the star, not the planet, which is unusual.</p>

<p>Several papers have been written by those much more knowledgeable than I, notably <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0960"" rel=""nofollow"">Crida &amp; Batygin (2014)</a> and <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/784/1/66/pdf/apj_784_1_66.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Xue et al. (2014)</a>. Both refer to Hot Jupiter models, but the ideas behind them are still possible for other planets.</p>

<p>The former suggest</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contemporary observational surveys suggest that a considerable fraction of solar-type stars are born as binary or multiple systems (Ghez et al. 1993; Kraus et al. 2011). Moreover, most stars form in embedded cluster environments (Lada &amp; Lada 2003) where dynamical evolution can lead to the acquisition of transient companions (Malmberg et al. 2007). Recently, Batygin (2012) showed that the presence of a companion to a young star can force the proto-planetary disk to precess around the binary’s axis, so that the plane in which planets eventually form and the equatorial plane of the central star can differ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also suggest that encounters with other planets could be responsible for some cases of this (although an angle of 90° makes this seem rather improbable); a related idea that has been applied to Kuiper Belt Objects is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozai_mechanism"" rel=""nofollow"">Kozai mechanism</a>. The companion to this theory is that the star was perturbed by an encounter, possibly with a companion (as I discussed earlier).</p>

<p>Xue et al. discuss similar scenarios, focusing in part on ""dynamic"" interactions between planets. Direct tidal interactions between the star and the planet are also a possible scenario. </p>

<p>At what point during the ""diamond ring"" does it become too bright to look at safely without safety equipment, and what is the relative brightness of the diamond?</p>
","<p>The corona varies dramatically in brightness from the inner portion near the sun to the outer portion a few solar radii away. The innermost portion is the brightest; at ISO 100 and f5.6, an exposure of ~1/125 second will capture it. So it's roughly the same brightness as the full moon. The outer corona will require much longer exposures of perhaps a half second, but note that during this time the sun will move noticeably with a long lens if you're not using a tracking mount, so some blurring will likely occur. Overall, practicing on the crescent moon will give you a pretty good idea of the dynamic range of the corona.</p>

As you can see, the maximum separation between the barycentre and the solar centre appears to be about 2 solar radii over the timescale covered by these plots, but is as small as a tenth of a solar radius (e.g. in 1950). ""How elliptic?"" Not at all really, it is a complicated superposition caused by the orbits mainly of Jupiter and Saturn, but all the planets contribute to a greater or lesser extent.</p>

<p>The barycenter is calculated from the instantaneous positions of all the discrete masses in the solar system. I do not know for sure, but assume that all the planets are included, but that everything else is negligible at the scale of the thickness of the line.</p>

<p>If it is assumed to be true, then the photons emitted by these galaxies from this point onwards should be around for us to see these galaxies (and even the first light emerged from the Big Bang must be visible).</p>

<p>Then why is the observable so small? It should depend upon the direction in which we look. That is, if we look in the direction of the center of the expanding sphere, it should be a small observable universe. If we train our telesopes in 'exactly' opposite direction of the center, it should be 'fully' observable.</p>

<p>Does it work this way? Or are my basics wrong?</p>
","<p>Quick answer: Because they didn't entered our event horizon. Some never will. And some will move out of our event horizon - their last photons that'll be received here being sent right now.</p>

<p>Let's do some fact checks first:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...]the galaxies that are now at the 'edge' (not visible
  theoretically) must have been (at some point in time) at place around

<p><strong><a href=""http://www.space.com/11386-galaxies-formation-big-bang-hubble-telescope.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">According to current calculations</a></strong>, the first galaxies may have formed around 200 million years after the Big Bang - older estimates went with the 400-500 MY range. For a long, long while, there were no stars to be seen. So if you go back in time you won't be seeing the same structures we see today.</p>

<p>Second, and that may be an awkward mental experiment, nothing else was occupying our place other than ourselves. I'll ask you to excuse the cliché, but the old balloon example is very apt to explain this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://astrobioloblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/hubble_expansion.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As the universe expands, the distance between celestial bodies increases. Now, here's a way to put it: <em>space is being generated in between the objects</em>.</p>

<p>And not only that - while there's a limit on how fast you can move on the balloon's surface, <em>it doesn't apply to the amount of space being generated</em>.</p>

<p>As a direct consequence there's a bubble around us that basically works in the very same way as a black hole's event horizon does:</p>

<ul>
<li>In a black hole, gravity is so strong that its pull on photons exceeds <em>C</em> (the speed of light, or 299,792,458 m/s);</li>
<li>On a fringe object, the amount of space generated by the expansion, per second, may exceed <em>C</em>; its photons will never reach Earth.</li>
</ul>

<p>And it seems that we live in a <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">accelerated universe</a></strong> - that is, the spatial acceleration ratio is actually going up.

"Why do certain massive stars leave no remnants?","510","","<p>Mass and metallicity are the two main determinants for a star's fate. This is simple enough.

<p>Generally, as metallicity decreases and mass increases, black holes become more likely to form. At a specific mass and metallicity range, however, there are no remnants left behind. From that point, increasing mass and decreasing metallicity allows for black holes again.</p>

<p>How does this work? Why would there ever be an area in which no remnants are left behind? In fact, it seems almost random, since the range lies right between direct black hole ranges.</p>
","<p>The gap appears because of <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair-instability_supernova"">pair instability supernovae</a></em>. In short, as one looks at such massive stellar cores at increasing temperatures, an ever-larger fraction of the photons are sufficiently energetic to spontaneously form electron-positron pairs. True, they soon recombine, but there is nevertheless a loss in (radiation) pressure, which causes contraction, and thus a further increase of temperature. If unstable, as appears to be the case in such massive stars, this leads to more high-energy photons, more pairs, and a further loss of pressure.</p>

<p>Models of such objects suggest that the collapse leads to a sudden, rapid ignition of oxygen- and silicon-burning reactions. In a mass range between about 150 and 250 solar masses (corresponding to core masses of very roughly half of that), the thermonuclear explosion is enough to rip the core apart, and there's nothing left to collapse. This is a bit like how the sudden onset of carbon burning destroys white dwarfs in type Ia supernovae. More massive cores are more strongly bound by gravity, and models suggest that the nuclear explosion isn't enough to unbind the core.</p>

<p>So below about 150 solar masses (and at higher metallicities, I think), the core doesn't reach pair-unstable conditions. Above about 250 solar masses, the induced nuclear explosion isn't powerful enough to destroy the core.</p>

<p>For instance, let's say the Earth/Sun travel around the Galaxy at approximately 230 km every second and say we want to look at the spot where the Earth was 1000 years ago. Well, it turns out then that the Earth was at some location in space that is currently about $7\times 10^{12}$ km away (7 trillion). But the light that came from the Earth then, has already been travelling outwards at the speed of light for 1000 years, covering a distance of 1000 light-years, which is about $10^{16}$ km.

"When the universe expands does it create new space, matter, or something else?","509","","<p>I am wondering what exactly is meant when it is said the universe expands. Does it simply create new space for matter to fill, does it also create new matter/dark matter to fill that space, or am I way off? Thank you for any help!</p>
","<p>Yes, space is constantly being created. The new space does not hold any matter (like atoms) or dark matter. This means that the <em>density</em> of normal and dark matter <em>de</em>creases at the same rate as the volume <em>in</em>creases. However, dark <em>energy</em>, which is something completely different and thought to be a property of vacuum itself, is being created with the new space, so the density of dark energy stays constant.</p>

<p>This in turns mean that while the early Universe (i.e. from it was 70,000 years old and until it was almost 10 billion years) was dominated by matter, the Universe is now dominated by dark energy.</p>

"Which type of telescope should I make?","508","","<p>I am not very much interested in observational physics but I just like to look at the night sky. It gives me a lot of inspiration. So, i was thinking about making a telescope for basic observations. I googled about the design and found two models. One consisted of two convex lenses of different focal lengths and the other one consisted of a concave lens as the objective lens and a convex lens as the eye-piece(that's called a Galilean one I guess). </p>

<p>I am confused about which one should I make. Can anyone give me some insight into both these types?</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That's the ABC of refractor design - the most basic types of refractor. They are only interesting from a historic perspective.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refracting_telescope"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refracting_telescope</a></p>

<p>You can certainly purchase a large convergent lens (bi-convex, or plan-convex) and use that as an objective. Then, for the eyepiece (ocular), you can use either a small convergent lens (bi-convex, or plan-convex), or small divergent (bi-concave, or plan-concave). Probably only the first one will work well: the image will be inverted, but the field of view will be nice and wide. The second design (divergent lens for eyepiece, Galilean refractor) provides a non-inverted image, but the field of view is extremely narrow and hard to use; avoid it, it's frustrating.</p>

<p>However, this sort of bare-bones design is only interesting if you want to reconstruct the history of astronomy. At least for the eyepiece you could just ""steal"" any cheap 1-1/4"" eyepiece from a telescope or microscope. Even the cheapest one will work much better than your single-lens ""eyepiece"".</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.telescope.com/Accessories/Telescope-Eyepieces/pc/3/47.uts?&amp;refinementValueIds=4469"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telescope.com/Accessories/Telescope-Eyepieces/pc/3/47.uts?&amp;refinementValueIds=4469</a></p>

<p>For the objective, again, I suggest you don't use a single convergent lens. It will work, but it will be full of aberrations (image distortions, color fringes, etc). Instead, go on Surplus Shed, click on the Lens Finder. For lens type, choose Achromat. For diameter, anything over 45 mm. For focal length, anything over 190 mm.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.surplusshed.com/lens.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.surplusshed.com/lens.cfm</a></p>

<p>An achromat is a combination of two lenses, glued together, that are designed to reduce aberrations. The image will be much better.</p>

<p>Their stock varies greatly. Right now, I've found these two:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.surplusshed.com/pages/item/pa1038.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.surplusshed.com/pages/item/pa1038.html</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.surplusshed.com/pages/item/pa1039.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.surplusshed.com/pages/item/pa1039.html</a></p>

<p>The 50 mm diameter, 300 mm focal length achromat, combined with a 15 mm focal length eyepiece, will provide 300 / 15 = 20x magnification. With a 5 mm eyepiece instead, it will give 300 / 5 = 60x magnification. Don't go much higher than this (more magnification is not always better).</p>

<p>The focal length of the objective dictates the length of the telescope tube. E.g. with the 300 mm achromat, the telescope length will be 300 mm plus some extra at the back for the eyepiece.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Be mindful of the f-ratio. Basically, divide the focal length by the diameter, and that gives you the focal ratio.</p>

<p>A lens with a diameter of 50 mm and focal length of 500 mm has an f-ratio of f/10. A lens with a diameter of 50 mm and focal length of 300 mm has an f-ratio of f/6.</p>

<p>It's best to use an achromat with an f-ratio between f/8 and f/20. If you go below f/8 it will be very hard to collimate (fine tune) the scope. If you go above f/20, it will be too long.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sometimes you find super-cheap eyepieces there, too, like this one:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.surplusshed.com/pages/item/l2019.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.surplusshed.com/pages/item/l2019.html</a></p>

<p>Also keep digging around that site, maybe you'll find various other parts necessary for building the refractor.</p>

<p>Enormous care must be given to keeping the objective and the eyepiece collimated (aligned and centered). Even a tiny collimation error will greatly affect performance. This is not a trivial engineering problem.</p>

<hr>

<p>There's also an easier way. You could purchase a complete kit, like the Galileoscope:</p>

<p><a href=""http://galileoscope.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://galileoscope.org/</a></p>

<p>It's a 50 mm (2"") f/10 refractor that has about the same performance like good binoculars. The price is very affordable (and very cheap for what it does). As a telescope and mirror maker, I was impressed by the quality of the achromat doublet objective that they provide (50 mm diameter, 500 mm focal length, f/10). For the price and the size, it is well made and well corrected, and punches well above its price category.</p>

<p>The kit comes with everything you need: all the lenses, the tube, various small parts, etc., including components for the ocular (eyepiece). Another nice thing is that you can swap its eyepiece for a standard 1-1/4"" eyepiece used in a regular telescope (like a cheapie on Surplus Shed). Whoever designed this thing put some good thought in it. There are several different instruction documents on the site, that you can choose from.</p>

<p>My 9 and 12 year old sons put it together in an afternoon. It's that easy.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> What can you do with the Galileoscope?</p>

<p>Obviously, you can watch some of the planets. You'll see the two big equatorial belts on Jupiter, and the 4 galilean moons of Jupiter. Saturn's rings will be quite obvious. Venus will show a crescent - it will look just like the Moon, only much smaller.</p>

<p>You can watch the Moon, too. The big craters are quite visible in an instrument this size.</p>

<p>You can watch some of the deep space objects too. The Orion Nebula is quite visible actually. The Andromeda galaxy is somewhat visible from a place outside the city.</p>

<p>Double stars such as Albireo, which appear as single star to the naked eye, are easily split by a 50 mm aperture. Albireo is very pretty, and easy to see in a Galileoscope - an orange/blue double, easy and wide, very beautiful.</p>

<p>Mizar, one of the main stars in the Big Dipper, is also a double. This one is a lot more tight. I think you should be able to split it in a G-scope anyway.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.synapses.co.uk/astro/bearings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.synapses.co.uk/astro/bearings.html</a></p>

<p>For the planets and the Moon, you'll probably want high magnification. 50x or more, up to 100x (the maximum supported by this instrument).</p>

<p>Make sure the instrument is sitting on a stable, firm support. A flimsy, shaky tripod is the enemy of high magnification.</p>

<p>Look on Surplus Shed and other online stores for 1-1/4"" eyepieces. A 5 mm eyepiece will give you 100x magnification - the maximum. A 10 mm eyepiece will give 50x. A 20 mm eyepiece will give 25x - nice and wide, good for big objects like the Orion Nebula.</p>

<p>Look for eyepieces with a wide field of view (at least 50 degrees, up to 80 degrees, or more, if you can find them). A wide field makes everything easier.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is also possible to build everything from scratch, including making the lenses and/or mirrors yourself from a piece of glass. But that is a MUCH bigger commitment, and a much more long-term project (a few months to a year).</p>

<p>Can I assume this is the same as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_periapsis"" rel=""nofollow"">longitude of the periapsis</a>? Can I just calculate it adding the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of periapsis together?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all the data that I find on this parameter is either related to Duffet-Smith's book or algorithms based on it. So, I have no idea on how this can be calculated for a specific epoch.</p>
","<p>Perigee is the Earth-specific name for periapsis. People use longitude (which is a composite angle rather than an angle) because this solves the problems of circular and equatorial orbits.</p>

<p>The reason you need to use an epoch time to specify the Moon's argument of perigee and longitude of ascending node is because the Moon's orbit about the Earth precesses. Neither the argument of perigee nor the longitude of ascending node is constant. Instead, they are functions of time (and hence, so is longitude of perigee).</p>

<p>In the case of an inclined, non-circular orbit, ""longitude"" is the sum of the right ascension of the ascending node (which is measured on the fundamental plane of the reference system) and some angle (or angle-like measure such as mean anomaly) on the orbital plane. Thus longitude of periapsis (or longitude of perigee in the case of an object orbiting the Earth) is the sum of the object's right ascension of ascending node and it's argument of periapsis.</p>

<p>The use of ""longitude"" as orbital elements are for two reasons: To be able take advantage of Hamiltonian mechanics (this was done by Delaunay, resulting in the Delaunay orbital elements), and to address problems related to orbits with very small inclinations and/or very small eccentricities (this was done by Poincaré, resulting in the Poincaré orbital elements). Anomaly and longitude are synonymous in the case of an orbit with zero inclination.</p>

<p>While it is invalid to add two angles on different planes and treat the sum as if it were an angle, it is not necessarily invalid to treat that sum as what it is, a composite angle or dogleg angle, which is exactly what the Poincaré orbital elements do. (""Dogleg angles"" aren't angles. Analogous terms include ""dwarf planets"", which aren't planets, and ""red herrings"", which oftentimes are neither red nor herrings.)</p>

<p>I think that when Arcturus passed through the meridian, the hour angle will be 0 degree. Sidereal time equal hour angle plus right ascension. right ascention of any stars always be the same. So Sidereal time will be as same as every times while the star located at the meridian. And it doesn't matter because solar time equal sidereal time minus 12hr. Do I understand something wrong? And how do I do this question?</p>

<p>Adding question;</p>

<p>Your answer was very clear. But if I consider about the moon instead ex; the observer is at the equator and saw the moon which has a declination of 0 degree set at 11:00 PM yesterday, what time the observer will see the moon set today? I try to use the thinking process like this again. I know that the sidereal month of the moon is 27.32166 days. I calculate the solar month of the moon from 365.24219 of solar year divided by 12, and I get 30.43684 days per solar month. From subtracting both of these numbers, I get 3 days plus about 2 hours 45 minutes and 52 seconds. So to answer this question I will get 2 hours 45 minutes 52 seconds behind. My answer is that I will see the moon set at 13:45:52 PM. Do I right? I don't understand why the time I get is behind instead of earlier as the question about the Arcturus I asked before. I'm also not sure that does the declination of the moon and the position of the observer relate or not too. Thank you very much:)</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Find the time that Arcturus passed the meridian in 29 April.</p>

<p>With respect to the Sun, the Earth rotates once every 24 hours.  But because the Sun's apparent position changes in the sky due to Earth's revolution around the Sun, the Earth rotates once every <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/14700/how-long-is-a-day-on-earth/"" rel=""nofollow"">23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds with respect to the stars</a>.  Because of this 3 minutes, 56 seconds difference, all stars rise and set 3 minutes, 56 seconds earlier each succeeding day.  This applies to the time of a star passing through the meridian as well.</p>

<p>So, on the next day, April 29, Arcturus will pass the meridian at 22:56:04.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And what day does the Arcturus will pass the meridian about 01:00:00?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over the course of an entire year, about 365 days and 6 hours, these 3 minutes and 56 seconds adds up to an entire day, so that exactly one year later, the same star will pass through the meridian at the same time of day.</p>

<p>For Arcturus to pass the meridian exactly 22 hours earlier, it should be 22/24 of a year before then, or about 335 days later, or about 30 days earlier, or March 29.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>solar time equal sidereal time minus 12hr</p>

<p>Generally not correct.  Solar time is based on the average time it takes for the sun to cross the meridian (24 hours), and <a href=""http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/what-is-sidereal-time"" rel=""nofollow"">sidereal time</a> is based on the time it takes for a star to cross the meridian.  Sidereal time counts 24 ""hours"" in 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds, meaning that it runs slightly faster than our normal solar time.</p>

<p>There is one day in which solar and sidereal time are 12 hours off, on the northward equinox in March.  The Sun is on the northward equinox, but solar time is measured since midnight where sidereal time is measured since passing the meridian (local noon).</p>

<p>There is one day in which solar and sidereal time coincide, on the southward equinox in September.  The Sun is on the southward equinox, 180 degrees in the sky from the northward equinox, so the 12 hours off from midnight and the Sun being 12 hours off from the northward equinox cancel.</p>

"How do astronomers estimate the total mass of dust in clouds and galaxies?","506","","<p>As I understand it astronomers estimate the mass of stars by studying the orbits of their companions (other stars or planets).  This helps them to derive relationships between the luminosities and masses of stars.  This allows them to infer the mass of stars of known luminosity.</p>

<p>But how do astronomers estimate the mass of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust"" rel=""nofollow"">cosmic dust</a> in particular clouds or in entire galaxies? </p>
","<p>Dust absorbs stellar light (primarily in the ultraviolet), and is heated up. Subsequently it cools by emitting infrared, ""thermal"" radiation. Assuming a dust composition and grain size distribution, the amount of emitted IR light per unit dust mass can be calculated as a function of temperature. Observing the object at several different IR wavelengths, a Planck curve can be fitted to the data points, yielding the dust temperature. The more UV light incident on the dust, the higher the temperature.</p>

<p>The result is somewhat sensitive to the assumptions, and thus the uncertainties are sometimes quite large. The more IR data points obtained, the better. If only one IR point is available, the temperature cannot be calculated. Then there's a degeneracy between incident UV light and the amount of dust, and the mass can only be estimated to within some orders of magnitude (I think).</p>

<p>If lines from various atomic or molecular transitions are seen as well, the composition can be better constrained. The size distribution can be determined from fitting the theoretical spectrum of a given distribution to observed dust spectra. This information is often not available in a given high-redshift galaxy, so here we can be forced to assume that the dust is similar in nature to ""local"" dust, i.e. in the Milky Way and our nearest neighbors.</p>

<p>If you're interested in the relevant equations, they can be found many places, e.g. <a href=""http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jpw/classes/ast622.fall2009/handouts/dust.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. </p>

<p>Another way to estimate the dust mass is to measure the metallicity of the gas with which the dust is is mixed, either from emission lines or absorption lines if a background source is available. The dust mass is then found from an assumed dust-to-metals ratio, which is pretty well-established in the local Universe, and to some extend also at higher redshifts.</p>

I understand that the comet has an orbit around the sun but how can scientists know that it won't be thrown off course for example by passing Jupiter and Jupiters gravity giving it a tug in a different direction? Its not a very big object in space so it seems to me that its orbit could be changed very easily.</p>
","<p>Each time Halley's comet passes us, we can make a pretty good estimate of its current orbit, and determine how close it will get to the massive bodies of the solar system like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune on its next orbit. We can make good estimates of gravitational perturbation effects, and thereby know where to look for it. </p>

<p>In fact, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley&#39;s_Comet#Computation_of_orbit"">astronomers have been doing exactly that</a> for centuries with remarkable accuracy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Halley thus concluded that all three comets were, in fact, the same object returning every 76 years, a period that has since been amended to every 75–76 years. After a rough estimate of the perturbations the comet would sustain from the gravitational attraction of the planets, he predicted its return for 1758.</p>
  
  <p>Halley's prediction of the comet's return proved to be correct, although it was not seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer. It did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused a retardation of 618 days. This effect was computed prior to its return (with a one-month error to 13 April) by a team of three French mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, Halley's position turns out to be hard to predict for time scales much beyond that of a single orbit; over the long term, <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7762"">the orbit is chaotically unstable</a> and it's possible that it will collide with a planet, or be ejected from the solar system, within some hundreds of thousands of years. </p>

<p>You mention: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Its not a very big object in space so it seems to me that its orbit could be changed very easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As it turns out, the mass of an object in space doesn't affect how the gravity of other bodies changes its trajectory. A feather, a baseball, a comet, and a small moon making a close flyby of Jupiter along the same trajectory, one after another, will all exit Jupiter's neighborhood in the same direction and at the same speed. The small moon will have more effect on <em>Jupiter</em> than the feather will, but aside from that there's no difference.</p>

"Do the planets, asteroid belt, kuiper belt, and scattered disc lie on the same plane?","504","","<p>If not, do any of the four groups in the title lie on the same plane as other members of the group? E.g. does the asteroid belt lie on the same plane as the planets do?</p>
","<p>They are not exactly in the same plane, but roughly are.</p>

<p>For example this graph representing the centaurs, the Kuipier belt and scattered disc objects show that most objects are around the same plane, with few objects with more than 30 degrees of inclination:</p>

<p>Again, few have more than 30 degrees of inclination.</p>

<p>The planets are also all roughly in the same plane. Lets take the ecliptic as a reference (which is almost the same thing as Earth orbital's plane):</p>

<ul>
<li>The Sun's equator has an inclination of 7.25 degrees.</li>
<li>Mercury has an inclination of 7.00 degrees.</li>
<li>Venus has an inclination of 3.39 degrees.</li>
<li>Mars has an inclination of 1.85 degrees.</li>
<li>Vesta has an inclination of 7.13 degrees.</li>
<li>Juno has an inclination of 12.98 degrees.</li>
<li>Ceres has an inclination of 10.59 degrees.</li>
<li>Pallas has an inclination of 34.84 degrees.</li>
<li>Interamnia has an inclination of 17.29 degrees.</li>
<li>Hygiea has an inclination of 3.84 degrees.</li>
<li>Jupiter has an inclination of 1.30 degrees.</li>
<li>Saturn has an inclination of 2.48 degrees.</li>
<li>Uranus has an inclination of 0.77 degrees.</li>
<li>Neptune has an inclination of 1.76 degrees.</li>
<li>Orcus has an inclination of 20.57 degrees.</li>
<li>Pluto has an inclination of 17.15 degrees.</li>
<li>Ixion has an inclination of 19.58 degrees.</li>
<li>Salacia has an inlination of 23.94 degrees.</li>
<li>Varuna has an inclination of 17.2 degrees.</li>
<li>Haumea has an inclination of 28.19 degrees.</li>
<li>Quaoar has an inlination of 7.99 degrees.</li>
<li>1992 QB<sub>1</sub> has an inclination of 2.19 degrees.</li>
<li>Makemake has an inclination of 29.00 degrees.</li>
<li>Eris has an inclination of 44.04 degrees.</li>
<li>Sedna has an inclination of 11.92 degrees.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of those bodies have a low inclination to the ecliptic, but Pallas is an interesting exception. I don't know why Pallas has such a high inclination but I would bet on a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozai_mechanism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kozai mechanism</a> due to Jupiter's influence.</p>

<p>Plutinos and Kuipier belt objects are influenced by Neptune, and part by the Kozai mechanism.</p>

<p>Eris is a special and curious case, it is too far from Neptune, although there is still some weak gravitational Neptune's influence there, but I don't know why its inclination is so high. This contrasts with Sedna, which have a more reasonably lower inclination.</p>

<p>Further, the Oort cloud is expected to be full of bodies of essentially unrestricted inclinations and possibly very excentric orbits, as a result of gravitational interactions with passing stars on the past. By the way, a passing star in a distant past might be an explanation for Eris orbit and inclination.</p>

","<p>Ok guys, I've found the solution. Sadly, if you really want to know the really  exact datetime, there is no exact and universal formula.</p>

<p>I found several formulas:</p>

<p>There are several problem with these formulas.</p>

<p><strong>What I'd like to know?</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned in my original post, I have a datetime, and a geolocation, and with that Swiss ephemeris program, I can ""query"" the angle of the sun.</p>

<p>From this point, I substract 88 degree with this angle, and I want to know the exact date time by the angle and the geolocation.</p>

<p><strong>The problems</strong></p>

<p>The first problem is the declination. There are several problems with this. The declination is not the same at every day in a year as you know. Ok, let's say, I want to figure it out. I can not. Since, I want to know the exact date first, I do not know, the ordinal date. Sigh, at this point the whole formula has a missing value. But, let's assume, I know. Even, if I know the ordinal date, the formula is not right, because the declination is not the same at 2015-01-01 and 2016-01-01. Let's see:</p>

<pre><code>swetest.exe -edirD:/Apache/htdocs/astro/vendors/swiss/ -b01.01.2010 -geopos19.2,47.29,0 -topo  -p0 -eswe -fPlTd -g, -head -n5 -s365.4
Sun            , 280.4507684,01.01.2010,-23.0283899
Sun            , 280.6104798,01.01.2011 9:36:00 ET,-23.0160751
Sun            , 280.7713793,01.01.2012 19:12:00 ET,-23.0008866
Sun            , 280.9345061,01.01.2013 4:48:00 ET,-22.9876598
Sun            , 281.0890407,01.01.2014 14:24:00 ET,-22.9741190
</code></pre>

<p>-22...., -23... is the declination. Declination is the same in a day. </p>

<p>So these formulas can gives you approximate results, but not the exact, even if you know the ordinal date. And I think, the formula is does not calculate with the leap years.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>

<p>In my case, the solution was to track back 95 days, and get 20 recors for every day from that time. 95 because the sun is moving 1 degree about 1 day and 2-3 hours. The sun has different speed at different dates, 95days seems enought for me for 88 degree.</p>

<p>With my program, I am checking, where the integer values are equals. For example, if I need to get 69.217465 degree I am just checking, where the sun was in 69.xxxxx position.</p>

<p>When I have this date, I am track back 3 days, and list the values by hours, 72 hours. I get the  proximate date and time. And after this, I track back 3 hours, and listing the results by seconds.</p>

<p>This will be the exact (most proximate) date and time.</p>

<p>From a Yahoo group, a guy told me, this is an interpolation. This is how you can get the exact date time for a given angle, I do not know more precise method. If you know, please write me.</p>

"How does light affect the universe?","504","","<p>When light is emitted by for example a star, that star loses energy - which causes it to reduce its gravity. Then that energy begins a journey for potentially billions of years, until it reaches some other object.</p>

<p>When that light reaches a surface, such as another star or galaxy, it will give that energy to the destination star in the form of heat. This causes the receiver to increase its energy, in turn restoring a sort of balance. It also causes the receiver to emit a minute amount of more light again, almost like a reflection.</p>

<p>It will also excert pressure on the receiving surface once it reaches its destination, be it a star, a rock or anything else.</p>

<p>But while that light is travelling through space, its energy is ""unavailable"" to the rest of the universe. Naturally I ask the following question: </p>

<p><strong>Will light cause gravity, while it is traveling?</strong></p>

<p>Every single star emits light in every direction, and will eventually reach every other star in the universe. At any single point in the universe, there must be a continous ray of light coming from every single other star in the universe, that has a direct path to that point. Given that all stars on the sky is sending photons that reaches every square centimeter of the earth surface, the amount of pressure should sum up to be quite large.</p>

<p><strong>Is the amount of pressure really neglible, given that every single atom on any surface is receiving light from every single lightsource on the sky?</strong></p>

<p>Based on a calculation found at <a href=""http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qshrink.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qshrink.html</a> the sun will during its lifetime emit 0.034 % of its total mass as energy. Assuming the sun is average, and that there are about 10^24 stars in the universe, and all of these stars on average are half way through their lifetime, there should be energy amounting to the gravity of about 1.7*10^22 suns distributed throughout the universe.</p>
","<p>Old question, but I'll address something that hasn't been brought up by the previous answers.</p>

<h2>Photons $\simeq$ CMB photons (to first order)</h2>

<p>As the others has already said: yes, light has energy and hence it gravitates. The bulk of photons that permeate the Universe isn't of stellar origin, though, but is in fact the cosmic microwave background, the energy density of which several orders of magnitude larger than other photons, as seen in the graph from <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/196373/70207"">this answer to ""Number density of CMB photons""</a>. In terms of number density, there are 4-500 photons per cm$^3$.</p>

<h2>Space is big and isotropic</h2>

<p>Since CMB photons are isotropically distributed, the ever-so-small radiation pressure is equal in all directions, and hence cancels out. And although we're all the time bombarded by both CMB photons and stellar photons, space is so mind-bogglingly big (<a href=""https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker&#39;s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Chapter_8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">D. Adams, 1978</a>) that if you consider a random photon in the Universe, the probability of it hitting anything at all is negligible. Roughly 90% of the CMB photons have traveled for 13.8 billion years without hitting anything; the remaining 10% interacted with the free electrons that were released after reionization, but weren't absorbed, just polarized, and by far most of these interactions took place shortly after reionization; by now, the Universe has simply expanded too much. </p>

<h2>Photons are redshifted</h2>

<p>Although there <em>is</em> energy in photons, and hence they add to gravitation, first of all they're homogeneously distributed in the Universe (and thus pulls equally in all directions), and second their energy density is negligible compared to baryons (""normal matter"" like gas, stars, and planets), dark matter, and dark energy. In fact, their relative densities are $\{\rho_\mathrm{bar},\rho_\mathrm{DM},\rho_\mathrm{DE},\rho_\mathrm{phot}\}/\rho_\mathrm{total} = \{0.05,0.27,0.68,10^{-4}\}$. But this was not always the case. As the Universe expands and new space is created, the density of matter decreases as $1/a^3$, where $a$ is the scale factor (""size"") of the Universe. The same is true for photons, but since additionally they're redshifted proportionally to $a$, their energy density decreases as $1/a^4$. That means that as you go back in time, the relative contribution of photons to the energy budget increases, and in fact until the Universe was 47,000 years old, its dynamics was dominated by radiation.</p>

"Sky photography through compositing images in software?","504","","<p>I've read about and seen some rather sophisticated rigs for night sky photography that allow for ultra-long-exposure photos by counteracting the rotation of the sky by rotating the camera with it. The problem is mechanics for such rigs is rather complex, expensive and not entirely within reach of an amateur.</p>

<p>I was considering a different approach: </p>

<ul>
<li>Set the camera on a firm tripod or whatever, leaving it motionlessly.</li>
<li>Use intervalometer in the camera firmware to take multiple photos of moderately long exposure, short enough that the stars don't blur into lines.</li>
<li>Save each as RAW so that the trace amounts of light captured in each of them don't get lost.</li>
<li>Either using more bright stars as markers, or even calculating the misalignment of the photos basing on movement of the sky and lens geometry composite the images in software, to obtain good images of the night sky.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously I wouldn't get very far with high zoom images, as the field of vision would shift away long before I'd get enough light in for a good photo, but obtaining a photo of a fair section of the sky from a relatively wide angle lens should be doable. </p>

<p>Is such approach used or even viable? Is there such software ""out there"" already or would I need to write my own from scratch? </p>
","<p>What you are talking about is making a 'mosaic'. This technique is commonly used in astronomy to stitch together many images that are off-set from each other of some (apparently) large astronomical object (e.g., a star cluster or a nearby galaxy). In addition to covering a large field of view, making a mosaic generally also improves signal to noise where the images overlap. </p>

<p>One way to realign the images is to uses cross-correlation to find the optimal shift for consecutive images in order to align them. This can be done in common data analysis languages such as python (free), matlab or IDL (not free).</p>

<p>I have not used black-box software to do this, but here is a list of programs that might help: <a href=""http://astronomyonline.org/AstronomySoftware.asp#CCD_Control_and_Imaging_Software:_"">http://astronomyonline.org/AstronomySoftware.asp#CCD_Control_and_Imaging_Software:_</a></p>

<p>How do I build something like that? I'm primarily interested in observing sunspots, but would also like to know, if there is any way for me to safely observe Sun's coronal activity to any appreciable detail with an enthusiast grade newtonian/dobsonian telescope? </p>

<p>Additionally, could I project the telescope's image directly on some screen behind it, without having to use any intermediary digital equipment, like a recording camera and a digital light projector? </p>
","<p>As for projecting the Sun onto a screen at a low cost, I would recommend starting with a ~50-200$ sunspotter box, which is basically a lens mounted on a wooden box, that projects the sun onto a white piece of card. The advantage of using a telescope is that it can be programmed to track the Sun, so that if you want to trace sunspots, for instance, you can do so at leisure, instead of having to race to finish before the Sun moves off of the page.</p>

<p>As for observing coronal features- this is a very difficult task. A H-alpha filter (expensive) can be purchased for a home telescope outfitted for solar observing. This would allow you to see filaments/prominences, which is low T (10^4 K) chromospheric material that extends into the corona, suspended by magnetic field and buoyancy forces. </p>

<p>To observe coronal material from Earth, you would need a coronagraph, which blocks out light from the central disk of the Sun. This is because coronal features are extremely dim, as compared with the photosphere. From Earth, coronal features are best observed with during a total eclipse. Using a telescope mounted coronagraph at home is not ideal (and probably not feasible) because a lot of light from the Sun would leak into your field-of-view, due to both diffraction, as well as sky brightness. The University of Hawaii takes these sorts of observations, but even with all of their expensive equipment, the space-based LASCO instrument is able to do far better. </p>

Even though the Earth makes an arc, I guess we make it a straight line.</p>

<p>I guess my question is whether I have understood the second law correctly? That the area of a triangle was being calculated in an elliptical orbit, no matter how elliptical the orbit is. </p>
","<p>Hohmannfan's answer is correct, but as I understand your question, you do understand the general idea correctly and the answer to your question is yes, no matter how eccentric the orbit, the planet spans equal areas over equal time, at least nearly perfectly. (more on that later)</p>

<p>You're mistake is in calling the sectors ""triangles"".    They're sectors of an ellipse from a focal point, not from the center.  I'm not sure what the mathematical term is for those shapes, but calling them triangles, while convenient, is incorrect, calling them sectors of an ellipse is problematic too because a sector without clarification implies it's initiated from the center point, not a focal point.   So, near as I could find, ""Sector from a focal point of an ellipse"" is correct, but long winded.  ""Kepler area"" would probably do the trick.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> just puts up a picture and calls them ""shaded areas"" or ""shaded sectors"".  </p>

<p>As for deviations from Kepler's law.  Mercury is close enough to the sun that relativity caused an observed deviation from it's predicted elliptical orbit.  Late 19th and early 20th century astronomers tried to explain that by adding a planet (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_(hypothetical_planet)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vulcan</a>), but they couldn't find that theoretical planet.   Einstein's laws later explained Mercury's observed deviation.  </p>

<p>Also, planets pull on each other and that's been known at least since Newton's time, as he did a fair bit of work on it but never solved it to his satisfaction.  Earth, for example, speeds up if Venus and Jupiter are ahead of it, and slows down when they are behind it.  These are called orbital perturbations and are simple in principal, quite complicated mathematically.   An unexplained deviation in Uranus' elliptical orbit lead to the discovery of the planet Neptune.  That's not a flaw in Kepler's law.  His law is so exact that when a deviation to an elliptical orbit is observed, we know there's another gravitational body out there and we even know about where to look.</p>

<p>The five <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lagrange points</a> are unstable, for one because of the gravitational anomalies of the two massive bodies of the Lagrange system, eccentric orbits, and there are many other factors to their instability. At the same time, they are least gravitationally attractive points around two massive bodies.</p>

<p>Think of L-points as parking your car on a flat space at the top of the hill. You'll have to approach with some control and then try to balance at your parking spot, if you don't plan using your handbrake and also remain there stationary:

<p>No body with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass"" rel=""noreferrer"">rest mass</a> would stay there on its own accord, not unless it has active attitude control to position itself there and constantly adjust for changes in gravitational attraction vector as the two mass bodies rotate around their axes, change distance while orbiting each other, or L points being influenced by other mass bodies of the same planetary system.</p>

He may live in a space station around Jupiter, or in any ot it's moons (I believe that it doesn't matter for this question). If this person look to the Sun he can see the asteroid belt, since it is between them? If generally not, then he would be able to see larger bodies such as Ceres?</p>
","<p>No. The asteroid Belt is on average about 2.6 AU from the Sun.</p>

<p>Earth is 1 AU from Sun, 1.6 AU from the asteroid belt.</p>

<p>Jupiter is 5.2 from Sun, 2.6 AU from the asteroid belt. I.e. much further away.</p>

<p>Also, it should be easier to see asteroids from inside their orbit since they reflect more sunlight towards us. From Jupiter you would see their shadowed sides. Ceres is to Jupiter what Venus is to Earth. Venus is inside of us just like Ceres is inside of Jupiter. When it is at its nearest, we can only see a thin rim of sunlight on one half of its edge. But when an outer object like Mars is at its closest to us, we see its entire hemisphere lit up by the Sun. Add to that that when Venus is at its closest to us, as when Ceres is at its closets to Jupiter, it is very near to the Sun on the sky and therefor lost in the bright Solar light.</p>

<p>Ceres wasn't discovered until year 1801. That's after the discovery of Uranus 20 AU away. You'd need an even better telescope to find Ceres from Jupiter than from Earth.</p>

"Is the angular resolution of a telescope irrespective of used eye-piece?","495","","<p>Suppose a telescope has aperture $D = 20$ cm. The angular resolution of such telescope, according to the Rayleigh criterion (if I have understood it correctly), is given by </p>

<p>$$\theta = 1.22\cdot\frac{\lambda}{D} \text{ rad}$$</p>

<p>In other words, the angular resolution of the telescope is $0.69$ seconds of arc for $\lambda=550$ nm.</p>

<p>So if there is for example a double (binary) star, I will see them as one no matter what kind of magnification/eye-piece I am using if the angle between the stars (from my point of view) is less than $0.69''$? And vice versa, if the angle between the stars is greater than $0.69''$ I will see them as separate stars with <em>any</em> eye-piece or magnification?</p>

<p>(In theory, I know there's a lot of limitations from optics, seeing, etc.)</p>
","<p>The resolution of a telescope is the resolution of the image created by the primary mirror at the focal plane.  It provides the minimum separation between two equal brightness stars that appear separate in that image.  Often, astronomers put a photographic plate or a CCD at the focal plane, create long exposure photos and these can then be examined at arbitrary resolution (with a magnifying glass, microscope, or zoom software on a screen).  But, no matter how much you magnify the image, stars separated by less than the resolution will appear merged.  </p>

<p>It is true that if you use, say, a wide-angle lens when observing directly with a telescope the resolution that you get can be limited by the resolution of your eye.  What is happening is the telescope is forming an image on your retina that has the full resolution, but your eye cannot make use of the finest details.  On the other hand, a hawk looking through the same eyepiece may get full resolution benefits since hawks' eyes have better resolution than humans'. </p>

"How does the Grand Tack Hypothesis explain how Jupiter formed inside the frost line?","490","","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tack_Hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grand Tack Hypothesis</a> states that Jupiter formed at roughly 3.5 AU from the Sun, then interacted with a large portion of objects in the Solar System before settling into its current orbit.</p>

<p>Yet as I found from researching for an answer to <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/10996/how-did-jupiter-form-where-it-is/10997#10997"">this question</a>, giant planets generally form beyond the frost line - in fact, this explains why the giant planets are cut off from the terrestrial planets.</p>

<p>How does the Grand Tack Hypothesis get around this?</p>
","<p>A direct cribbing of the wiki's page for the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_(astrophysics)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">frost line</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In astronomy or planetary science, the frost line, also known as the snow line or ice line, is the particular distance in the solar nebula from the central protostar where it is cold enough for volatile compounds such as water, ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide to condense into solid ice grains. This condensation temperature depends on the volatile substance and the partial pressure of vapor in the protostar nebula. The actual temperature and distance for the snow line of water ice depend on the physical model used to calculate it:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>170 K at 2.7 AU (Hayashi, 1981)</li>
  <li>143 K at 3.2 AU to 150 K at 3 AU (Podolak and Zucker, 2010)</li>
  <li>3.1 AU (Martin and Livio, 2012)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Occasionally, the term snow line is also used to represent the present distance at which water ice can be stable (even under direct sunlight). This current snow line distance is different from the formation snow line distance during the formation of Solar System, and approximately equals 5 AU. The reason for the difference is that during the formation of Solar System, the solar nebula was an opaque cloud where temperature were lower close to the Sun,[citation needed] and the Sun itself was less energetic. After formation, the ice got buried by infalling dust and it has remained stable a few meters below the surface. If ice within 5 AU is exposed, e.g. by a crater, then it sublimates on short timescales. However, out of direct sunlight ice can remain stable on the surface of asteroids (and the Moon) if it is located in permanently shadowed craters, where temperature may remain very low over the age of the Solar System (e.g. 30–40 K on the Moon).</p>
  
  <p>Observations of the asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, suggest that the water snow line during formation of Solar System was located within this region. The outer asteroids are icy C-class objects (e.g. Abe et al. 2000; Morbidelli et al. 2000) whereas the inner asteroid belt is largely devoid of water. This implies that when planetesimal formation occurred the snow line was located at around $R_{snow} = 2.7$ AU from the Sun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in all of the three listed models, as well as the snow line inferred from asteroid properties, it seems that the 3.5 AU starting distance for Jupiter in the Grand Tack hypothesis remains comfortably behind the snow line (for water, at least, which is still an advantage over the inner planets).</p>

<p>Since it ultimately fell well within the snow line for a time, one would expect any exposed ices to rapidly sublimate.  I would guess that it made up for this by accreting the rockier planetesimals found in the inner parts of the Solar System, which could then shield the remaining ices.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~kwalsh/GrandTack.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This site</a> offers a pretty good detailing of the basic structure of the Grand Tack Hypothesis.  The most digestible piece of information is at the very bottom, in the form of an AVI file that models the first few million years of the solar system.  The short answer to your question is ""Jupiter is assumed to have already formed some fundamental core at the start of the hypothesis, then moves around accreting and scattering things through the inner solar system, until returning to the outer solar system to finish growing"".  The initial inward migration is caused by interactions with the relatively thick gaseous disc (the majority of it will never become part of any planet), which creates drag on the planets/planetesimals and causes them to lose velocity and fall inward.</p>

<p>But the video's pretty cool, so I'm going to link it and talk about it just for its own sake.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~kwalsh/Fred/GT-all.AVI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Get the video, as produced by the paper Walsh et. al., 2011</a></p>

<p>You may find it best to run this at half speed or slower to really see what's going on.</p>

<p>Here's how it starts out.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ISkJW.jpg"" alt=""starting configuration""></p>

<p>The solid black orbits are the gas giant orbits, with Jupiter being the innermost one, and Saturn the one after that.  The dashed circle represents a 2 AU distance from the sun (modern day Mars is currently at about 1.5 AU, and the modern asteroid belt stretches roughly 2.2-3 AU).  This is noteworthy since the model is trying to explain why Mars is so small, and why there is so little material (relatively speaking) in the asteroid belt.  The numerous small blue dots are the icy comets/planetesimals that form right around the point Jupiter starts out, and points beyond.  The numerous red dots are the rocky asteroids/planetesimals characteristic of the inner solar system.</p>

<p>For the first several seconds we see Jupiter creep in towards the inner solar system.  You'll notice a lot of rocky planetesimals get scattered out into the outer solar system, while some of the icy ones are scattered to the inner solar system.  Indeed, it seems to be a general feature of this model that the total amount of material within approximately 1 AU undergoes a net increase.</p>

<p>Saturn is also slowly moving in, but not nearly as quicky as Jupiter is (Neptune/Uranus seem pretty stable, but do ""pulse"" in and out a bit).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wZFQ6.jpg"" alt=""jupiter hits the 2 AU mark""></p>

<p>In this image we see that Jupiter hits the 2 AU mark at ~3 seconds in, corresponding to a model time of about 68,000 years.  At this point you can see a dashed circle at about the 3.5 AU distance, corresponding to Jupiter's starting distance.  Saturn is about 4 AU out now, having started at over 5.</p>

<p>The third through fourth second are fairly stable-looking, with Jupiter moving in to about 1.5 AU but the other outer planets staying mostly put.</p>

<p>But in the 5th second (~94,000 years model time)...</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/25OF2.jpg"" alt=""Saturn makes its move""> <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/N2gYH.jpg"" alt=""Saturn still moving fast""></p>

<p>We see Saturn make a very rapid move inwards.  This is the main reason I suggest playing it slowly, as you can very easily miss it and lose track of where each solid black orbit has come from.  By model time 98,000 years (still in the 5th second of the video time), Saturn has already come to within about 2 AU of the Sun; Jupiter is still about 1.5 AU, and there is a thick concentration of mostly rocky planetesimals within 1 AU.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/trda6.jpg"" alt=""Saturn and Jupiter rebound back out""></p>

<p>By model time of about 120,000 years, Saturn and Jupiter are rebounding back out into the outer solar system, to much the same distances we see today, scattering most of the planetesimals that remained in the areas that would become Mars and the asteroid belt.  This leaves a fairly dense disc of material for Earth, Venus, and Mercury to form and grow from, while leaving significantly less for Mars, and lesser still for the asteroid belt.</p>

<p>The whole 10 second movie covers a model time of 600,000 years.

"What are the main differences between solar flares and coronal mass ejections?","484","","<p>Specifically, what causes them, what sort of damage can they cause, and what are the differences in their composition? </p>
","<p>The following definitions are according to NASA.</p>

<p><a href=""http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/flares.shtml"">""Solar Flares""</a> are gigantic explosions from the surface of the Sun, occurring near sunspots along the dividing/neutral line between opposite magnetic field areas.</p>

<p><a href=""http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/CMEs.shtml"">""Coronal Mass Ejections""</a> (CME's) are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>huge bubbles of gas threaded with magnetic field lines that are ejected from the Sun over the course of several hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the Earth's magnetic field protects the biosphere from the worst of these forms of 'space weather', according to the website <a href=""http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/sftheory/spaceweather.htm"">""Space Weather: What impact do solar flares have on human activities?""</a>, the effects that do affect us are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Disturbance of the ionosphere, disrupting radio communications.</p></li>
<li><p>heating, hence expansion of the atmosphere would cause drag on satellites, degrading their orbits, also affecting the accuracy of GPS.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>From the Solar Weather site, an important distinction between CME's and solar flares in how they affect the Earth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coronal mass ejections are more likely to have a significant effect on our activities than flares because they carry more material into a larger volume of interplanetary space, increasing the likelihood that they will interact with the Earth. While a flare alone produces high-energy particles near the Sun, some of which escape into interplanetary space, a CME drives a shock wave which can continuously produce energetic particles as it propagates through interplanetary space. When a CME reaches the Earth, its impact disturbs the Earth's magnetosphere, setting off a geomagnetic storm. </p>

<p>Very severe CME's can also potentially disrupt power grids and communications.</p>

"Is there any hard evidence that rogue planets exist?","483","","<p>A rogue planet (or a rogue anything, for that matter: a celestial body other than a star) is something that's drifting through space without being attached by gravity to any star. They're just out there in the big black void. Is there any evidence that they actually exist? Or are they purely hypothetical?</p>
","<p>Rogue planets have been discovered by infra-red imaging because planets are hot when they form.  Here's a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_planet#Known_or_possible_rogue_planets"">list</a> of a few.  </p>

<p>There's 2 types of Rogue planets.  One is failed stars.  condensing pockets of gas and dust that form similar to how our solar-system formed, but that are too small to form stars.   <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/104210/rogue-planets-could-form-on-their-own-in-interstellar-space/"">Source</a>.</p>

<p>The 2nd type is planets that escape from a star's orbit.   This can happen by the star ejecting material and losing mass which causes the planets to expand in more distant orbits, some eventually escaping, or by gravitational assist either planet on planet or by two stars passing quite close to each other.    It's statistically impossible for Rogue Planets not to, from time to time, get ejected from solar systems, so they have to exist at least in reasonably large numbers throughout the galaxy, though I don't think it's well known how common there are.   </p>

<p>Our solar-system might have ejected a planet - see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_fifth_giant_planet"">here</a>.   In general, larger planets can eject smaller ones but mostly not the other way around, but two stars that pass too close to each other can eject any planets, mostly ones with more distant orbits.  A star that loses a lot of it's mass or a star that goes nova can push planets out of it's orbit too.</p>

"Spacetime curvature illustration accuracy","483","","<p>When a particle travels through spacetime, this is sometimes illustrated moving in flat grid with various depths. How accurate is this way of imagining gravity?</p>

<p>Can the gravity well be infinitely deep?</p>

<p><a href=""http://blakemaybank.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Gravity_well.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gravity well http://blakemaybank.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Gravity_well.gif</a></p>

<p>Looking at this illustration, it suggests that there is an amount of distance going down the well. Is movement <em>down the well</em> limited by the speed of light? Remember, I'm aware that it is an illustration, and the question is about the accuracy of the illustration.</p>

<p>Is all gravitational wells infinitely deep at the exact center? So that if a particle could be made small enough to fit within the center, it would become a black hole.</p>
","<p>Newtonian gravity of a point-source can described by a potential $\Phi = -\mu/r$. If we suppress one spatial dimension and use it to graph the value of this potential instead, we get something that looks very close to this illustration, and is indeed infinitely deep at the center--at least, in the idealization of a point-mass. And farther away from the center, it goes flat, just as many illustrations like this have it.</p>

<p>Illustrations like this are fairly common, and I'm guessing that they're ultimately inspired by the Newtonian potential, because they have almost nothing to do with with the spacetime curvature.</p>

<p>Here's an isometric embedding of the Schwarzschild geometry at an instant of Schwarzschild time, again with one dimension supressed:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lNYcH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Above the horizon (red circle), the surface is a piece of a paraboloid (the <em>Flamm paraboloid</em>). Unlike the potential, it does not go flat at large distances.</p>

<p>Being isometric means that it correctly represents the spatial distances above the horizon at an instant of Schwarzschild time. Below the horizon, the embedding isn't technically accurate because the Schwarzschild radial coordinate does not represent space there, but time. Although if we pretend it's spacelike below the horizon, that would be the correct embedding. Picture the below-horizon part as having one-directional flow into the singularity.</p>

<p>Since we've only represented space and not time, the embedding is not enough to reconstruct the trajectories of particles in this spacetime. Still, it is a more accurate representation of a <em>part</em> of the spacetime curvature of point-source--specifically the spatial part.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>The velocity of the object from this perspective, would seem to increase, until a point - where the velocity in x,y coordinates starts to decrease due to most of the motion happening ""down"" the time dimension. Is this also correct? Would a photon seem to slow down when moving down the well, if seen from above?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is an embedding of a slice of spatial geometry, and is not a gravity well. The mathematical form of the paraboloid above the horizon is best described in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinates"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cylindrical coordinates</a> as
$$r = 2M + \frac{z^2}{8M}\text{.}$$
Here the vertical $z$ coordinate doesn't mean anything physically. It's purely an artifact of creating a surface of the same intrinsic curvature in Euclidean $3$-space as the $2$-dimensional spatial slice of Schwarzschild geometry.</p>

<p>For the Schwarzschild spacetime, radial freefall is actually exactly Newtonian in the Schwarzschild radial coordinate and proper time, i.e. time experienced by the freefalling object, rather than Schwarzschild time. So the Newtonian gravity well isn't actually a bad picture for the physics--it's just not the geometry and so is not a good representation of how any part of spacetime is curved. For non-radial orbits, the effective potential is somewhat different that than the Newtonian one, but ignoring the effects of angular momentum gets us the Newtonian form.</p>

<p>In Schwarzschild time, yes, a photon (or anything else) does slow down as gets near the horizon. In fact, in Schwarzschild time it never reaches the horizon, which is one indication that the Schwarzschild coordinates are badly behaved at the horizon. The coordinate acceleration actually becomes repulsive close to the horizon--and for a fast enough infalling object, is <em>always</em> repulsive. This can be understood as the particle moving to places with more and more gravitational time dilation. In proper time of any infalling observer, however, close to the horizon the acceleration is always attractive.</p>

I am talking about this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The paper, published in Lunar and Planetary Science, declares a planet as a round body that's never undergone fusion, and has less mass than a star. That's it. This means, Pluto would be planet again-- But it would also bring along Ceres, Eris, Makemake and Haumea... as well as 97 other objects.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>This is really a question of Language rather than Astronomy. The meaning of words is defined by their use. The IAU has proposed one way of using the word ""planet"", this group of scientists have proposed another.</p>

<p>Anyone can propose a definition of any word. This group proposes that a ""planet"" is any astronomical body which 1) Does not have, and never has had sustained nuclear fusion in its core, and 2) Is large enough for gravity to pull it into an ellipsoidal shape.</p>

<p>The intention of this definition is to make a planet defined entirely by ""what"" a body is, not by ""where"" it is. Under this definition the classic 8 planets, Ceres, Pluto, Charon, the Moon, the larger moons of Jupiter, Saturn Uranus and Neptune, Eris, Sedna, and the larger Kuiper belt objects would all be ""planets"" - about 100 known in total. The exoplanets would also be ""planets"" </p>

<p>Asteroids (except Ceres), comets and other small solar system bodies are too small, and so would not be planets.</p>

<p>The advantage of this definition is that the usually where something is located is not part of the definition of what it is. However, it contradicts several hundred years of use by defining the larger moons as planets.</p>

<p>Unlike the 8 planet definition, this does not have the support of a large international body of astronomers (the IAU). If you wish to use this definition you are free to. I doubt that without the support of the IAU this definition is ever going to be widely used. Most people will either use the 8 planet definition or the 8+Pluto definition.</p>

"Are we center of universe?","477","","<p>So I just learned that CMB redshift is 1100 regardless where we look (up down left right). According to Hubble's Law that makes it around 46 billion light years away, making it the farthest matter away from us. If CMB redshift is the same regardless which direction we look, then how could that be unless we're in the center of the universe?</p>
","<p>At the time when the universe was ~380,000 years old it was completely filled with a plasma and light. Light could only travel very short distances (I forget the specifics, but think a couple meters at the most) before being absorbed. So the entire universe was a fog, if you were there and there was an object 10 meters in front of you, you couldn't see it because all the light it emitted or reflected would be reabsorbed before it reaches your eyes. There are two things to keep in mind: <strong>1) This fog disappeared across the entire universe simultaneously (plus or minus some time, but effectively simultaneously); at the same point in time after the Big Bang, 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the fog dissipated due to recombination. And 2) Light takes time to travel.</strong></p>

<p>So let's say you are sitting in the fog-filled universe a few seconds before recombination happens. Light travels about 1 foot per nanosecond. So if the fog disappeared and there was a street lamp 10 feet in front of you, you wouldn't receive the first light from that lamp for 10 nano seconds. All of the light the lamp was emitting before recombination was just reabsorbed, but after recombination the first photons to leave the lamp no longer have anything to run into, so they continue on until hitting your eyes. A street lamp 20 feet away wouldn't be visible for 20 nanoseconds after recombination. The light of the plasma itself is effectively a street lamp at every location in space, so due to the 2 facts above, you would see successively farther street lamps in a shell centered on you.</p>

<p>After recombination happened and the entire universe became transparent. The fog is gone, but the farther you look the farther back in time you look, so you can only see back as far as when the fog existed, and the farthest you can see is the fog itself. After 13.8 billion years you can see all the way out to a shell of radius 13.8 billion light years around you (ignore expansion of the universe for now), and what you see is the light of the plasma (the fog) that was filling the universe 13.8 billion years ago, the CMB.</p>

<p>This scenario is the same if the universe is infinite in extent. We are not the center of the universe, we are simply the center of the <em>observable</em> universe, as is anyone else. Aliens looking towards Earth but are at the current location of edge of the CMB in some direction will not see Earth, they will see the last light of the CMB itself at our location when it was emitted 13.8 billion years ago; we are the edge of <em>their</em> observable universe.</p>

"Relation between black hole mass and radius, and our universe's","477","","<p>Is there a graph of known black holes, with their estimated mass in the X axis and their estimated radius in the Y axis? If so, where can we find it? I would like to know if a black whole with the whole estimated mass of our universe would have the estimated radius of our universe (which means our universe could be a black hole, that's why light can't escape it and it looks ""finite"").</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius"">Schwarzschild radius</a> of a black hole is probably the closest we can get to your question.</p>

<p>$$
r_s = (2G/c^2) \cdot m \mbox{, with }\ 2G/c^2 = 2.95\ \mbox{km}/\mbox{solar mass}.
$$
This means, that the Schwarzschild radius for a given mass is proportional to that mass.
The radius shouldn't be taken too literal in the physical sense, because space is highly non-euclidean close to a black hole.</p>

<p>Present (light-travel) radius of the visible universe, as seen from the earth:
$$13.81 \cdot 10^9\ \mbox{lightyears} = 13.81 \cdot 10^9 * 9.4607 * 10^{12}\ \mbox{km} = 1.3065\cdot 10^{23}\ \mbox{km}.$$
 So we need $$1.3065\cdot 10^{23}\ \mbox{km} / 2.95\ \mbox{km} =4.429 \cdot 10^{22}$$
solar masses to get a black hole of the light-travel Schwarzschild radius of the visible universe, pretty close (by order of magnitude) to the number of stars estimated for the visible universe.</p>

"Milky Way mass fraction breakdown review","471","","<p>I'd like to know a <strong>breakdown of the mass of the Milky Way, by the major categories</strong>. So, something like</p>

<pre><code>Stars       ... 3%
Cool nebula ... 7%
Gray matter ... 12%
Etc
Etc
</code></pre>

<p>This <strong>order-of-magnitude knowledge</strong> that everyone should know.</p>

<p>(Of course, when talking of the galaxy, we can, obviously, think of either just <strong>the visible disk-bulge</strong>, or perhaps, <strong>a greater unit</strong> of the galaxy sitting in a ""bulb"" (of - perhaps - dark matter (?), gas (?), dust (?), halo stars (?) or something else): a brief clear answer in a few sentences would expose these concepts.)</p>

<p><strong>Surprisingly, this information is nowhere to be found in one place as an overview.</strong></p>

<p>I appreciate that the largest chunk may be dark matter (is that right?); but I don't even have a <em>ballpark idea</em> for the rest. It's the sort of knowledge that is obvious to professionals, but surprisingly not outlined in any of the usual popular science sources.</p>
","<p>I should clear this up: the Milky Way isn't a completely well-defined body. Galaxies shouldn't be thought of as a single body — they are more like a collection of various material and stars. That said, I can only give you a wonky estimate of what <em>might</em> be the composition.</p>

<p>By ""Milky Way"", I'm assuming you mean only the Milky Way's disc and halo (and not <em>everything</em> that orbits the Galactic Center, like the satellite galaxies). That alone is hard to define, but let's get a rough estimate. The entire mass of the Milky Way is a bit uncertain, but it falls between $0.8–1.5×10^{12}M_☉$. Let's average that at about $1.2×10^{12}$.</p>

<p>Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of our galaxy, has a mass of roughly $4,000,000M_☉$. That would make it only ~0.0003% of the galaxy! A few sources state that dark matter composes about 90% of the Milky Way's mass.
So it has a mass of approximately $1.08×10^{12}M_☉$.</p>

<p>If we want to dissect the rest, we'll have to make generalizations. From some sources like <a href=""http://members.nova.org/~sol/chview/chv5.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> one, about 75% of MW stars are M type stars, 15% are F-K stars and the remaining 10% are mostly degenerate stars. Knowing that there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy, we can take their average masses and <em>kind of</em> conclude that 3% of the Milky Way's mass is from stellar objects.</p>

<p>Regarding the mass of gases in the Milky Way, <a href=""http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro1101/lectures/21MilkyWay.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this source</a> states that both atomic gas and molecular gas would individually make up 0.25% of the Milky Way's mass. Combined, we get 0.5%. The rest is buried in a sea of contradictions and mystery.</p>

<p>That said, here's the best breakdown I could make:</p>

<pre><code>Sagittarius A*: 0.0003%
Dark matter: 90%
Stellar objects: 3%
Gases and nebulae: 0.5%
Everything else: 6.5%
</code></pre>

"Is starquake unique to neutron star?","470","","<p>I read from somewhere that astronomer use X-ray to observe the ""shaking"" not to be confused with wobbling of a distant neutron star, I think it is similar to what geologist using microphone to detecting sound wave (vibration) inside the earth (no pun) to find out its composition. How does a tightly packed super dense object like neutron star generate starquake? is this neutron star signature move... i mean trait?</p>
","<p>I'm not sure what the current status of neutron starquake theory is, but last time I looked there were a couple of ideas.</p>

<p>The outer parts of a neutron star consist of a solid crust of neutron-rich nuclei (plus electrons, and a little deeper, free neutrons). Neutron stars are born rotating extremely fast, but they spin down due to the loss of rotational kinetic energy through magnetic dipole radiation. As a result, they are born oblate, but as the spin rate decreases this is not the lowest energy configuration. It used to be thought that starquakes (pulsar glitches) were caused by cracking of the crust and rearrangement towards a more spherical configuration.</p>

<p>The second idea is that it could be due to changes in the very intense magnetic field of the neutron star. The magnetic field is tied very tightly to the crustal material, so if the magnetic field shifts, possibly associated with the neutron star spin down, then it will put the crust under stress, which can be relieved by a starquake.</p>

<p>White dwarf stars also contain solid, crystalline material, however they do not spin so fast and do not have similar ultra-strong magnetic fields. I have not heard that they experience starquakes.</p>

<p>""Normal stars"" do not have a crust or any other solid layer, so there can be no similar starquake phenomenon.</p>

"What point does Earth actually orbit?","470","","<p>If we consider the two largest masses in our solar system - the Sun and Jupiter, by themselves, they will orbit a common barycenter which is somewhere offset from the Sun's center in the direction of Jupiter (just above the Sun's surface). If we add Saturn, things get more complicated, but there is still a barycenter, even if it follows a complex path with respect to the Sun's center (or the Sun has a complex wobble around the barycenter). Add Neptune and all the other masses in the solar system, and things get even more complicated. Neverthess, there is still a barycenter (often outside the limb of the Sun) about which the Sun does a complex dance.</p>

<p>Now, what is Earth actually orbiting? The Earth's orbit is described to be an ellipse; the ""center"" of an elliptical orbit occurs at one of the focal points of the ellipse. What is at the focal point of the elliptical path the Earth follows? Is it the solar system barycenter or is it the Sun's (wobbling) center of mass? In other words, is the Earth's orbit shifting as the Sun is tugged around, our distance from the Sun never varying by more than the eccentricity of the ellipse, or do we orbit the solar system barycenter, and our distance from the Sun varies by the sum of our orbital eccentricity plus the amount the Sun wobbles in its own orbit around the barycenter?</p>
","<p>Short answer is ""The Sun"".</p>

<p>As Conrad notes, since when you include the effects of Jupiter, the Earth orbit is non-keplerian, notions of centre are not really defined. But you can ask, in Newtonian gravity, where the Earth's acceleration vector points. Now the acceleration of the Earth is due mostly to the Sun, partly to the moon and slightly to the other planets.  </p>

<p>Let's ignore the moon (ie consider the motion of the Earth Moon barycentre)</p>

<p>The acceleration due to the sun is 4 orders of magnitude greater than that due to Jupiter. So if Jupiter is at right angles to the Earth, the acceleration vector of the Earth is slightly pulled away from the centre of the sun. But not by much, in fact it points to a point about 4000km from the centre. The sun has a radius of 700000km, so the point the Earth is orbiting is well inside the sun, and isn't the Sun Jupiter barycentre.</p>

<p>To see why the Earth doesn't orbit the barycentre, consider the motion of the Sun in a three body system (Sun-Jupiter-Earth) The Earth doesn't orbit the Sun-Jupiter barycentre just as the Sun doesn't orbit the Earth-Jupiter barycenter.</p>

Theoretically, this requires antimatter to have clumped early on, which is rather unlikely/impossible.</p>

<p>A far more likely explanation is that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation"">charge-parity symmetry is violated</a>. In other words, flipping the charges and parities in a reaction may not lead to the same dynamics &mdash; the outcome (when the charge/parity is flipped back) or distributions of outcomes may not be the same. Usually, we expect that if we flip the charges on both sides of a reaction, the reaction proceeds in the same manner (with same probabilities, etc). There is evidence that suggests that this may not be true. If this is indeed the case, then the matter-antimatter imbalance is not that hard to explain.</p>

<p>I know you don't 'discover' a huge disc in the sky. But still, what is the first recorded reference to the Moon being a satellite of the Earth? That someone knew it is smaller and orbiting? Celestial Sphere does not count.</p>
","<p>From before the dawn of history people naturally assumed that the sky was a solid dome above the flat earth.  The dome was assumed to rotate once a day, so the stars were assumed to be lights attached to the dome.  </p>

<p>Anyone who assumed that the sky dome was opaque had to assume that the sun and the wandering planets were nearer than the sky dome.  I think that it was usually assumed the sky dome was opaque and colored blue, thus making the sky seem blue when it reflected the light of the sun during the day, thus making the sun closer than the sky dome.</p>

<p>Those who kept records of astronomical observations soon noticed that the moon occulted or passed in front of stars, planets, and the sun (solar eclipses), and thus was closer.</p>

<p>Everyone assumed that the sun and the moon were tiny, until traveler's reports showed that they had the same apparent diameters every place that as visited, and so were about equally far away from every place that was visited.  Thus as the size of the known world grew larger and larger, the minimum possible size and distance of the moon and the sun grew larger and larger.</p>

<p>The idea of a spherical earth was proposed and gradually accepted by Greek philosophers between the sixth and third centuries BC.  Thus the earth became known as Earth, a sphere instead of a flat disc, and the dome of the sky became a hollow spherical shell around it.</p>

<p>In Hellenistic times the diameter of the Earth was calculated with reasonable accuracy, as well as the distance to the moon and thus its diameter.  So it became known that the moon was about a quarter the diameter of the Earth and over sixty Earth radii distant.</p>

<p>Because of solar eclipses, it had been known since prehistoric times that the moon was closer than the sun, and keepers of astronomical records of events when the moon occulted (passed in front of) stars and planets knew that the moon was closer than planets and stars.</p>

<p>Anyone who assumed geocentrism, that the Earth was the enter of the universe, naturally assumed that every object revolved around the Earth, including the moon, and that the moon was thus the closest satellite of the Earth.  A few ancient Greek philosphers supported the Heliocentric theory, that the Earth and the planets revolved around the sun.  Some of them could have believed that the moon also revolved around the sun, but as far as I know all heliocentric believers also had the moon revolve around the Earth.</p>

<p>By the last few centuries BC there were many educated persons who believed that the Earth, the moon, and the sun were giant balls of rock (and thus somewhat similar objects), that the sun was a giant burning rock, and that the stars and planets might also be giant burning rocks far, far away from the Earth and appearing as dots as seen from Earth.  Since everybody already since prehistoric times believed that the moon revolved around the Earth, by the last few centuries BC educated people in Western civilization believed that the moon was what we now call a natural satellite of the Earth, though some of them believed and some did not that the sun and planets were also natural satellites of the Earth.</p>

"Why can we see stars but not astronaut on the moon","467","","<p>A question came up today in astronomy class and it got me wondering all night.</p>

<p>How is it that if stars are so far away, we can see them so clearly but we cannot see astronauts on the moon.</p>
","<p>An astronaut on the moon could only be seen by reflecting the Sun's light towards Earth. Stars on the other hand emit their own light.</p>

<p>To first order, the amount of flux incident upon the Moon from the Sun is the same as that at the Earth - about 1.4 kW/m$^{2}$.</p>

<p>Let us assume that an astronaut is <em>perfectly reflective</em> and that the relevant reflective area that we can see from the Earth is 1 m$^2$. NB: If the astronaut is not lit up by the Sun, then there is obviously no way that they can be seen.</p>

<p>Treating the astronaut on the Moon as an isotropic point source emitter of reflected light, we have a light source of power 1.4 kW at a distance of 400,000 km. The flux at the Earth is therefore $7\times10^{-16}$ W m$^{-2}$.</p>

<p>How does that compare with starlight? Well, the total luminosity of the Sun is $3.8\times10^{26}$ W. It has an absolute magnitude of 4.8. This means that if we put the Sun at a distance of about 20 pc, it would be about as faint as the faintest naked eye star in the sky. The flux received at the Earth from such a star would be $8\times 10^{-11}$ W m$^{-2}$ and thus 100,000 times brighter than the astronaut.</p>

<p>No need to worry about the resolution of the eye, since both the star and the astronaut (at the distance of the moon) are unresolved points.</p>

<p>Also no need to go into the problems of contrast against the moon's bright surface (which you <em>would</em> need to consider if an astronaut's reflective area was 100,000 times bigger), the reflected light from the astronaut is just too faint to be seen at that distance.</p>

"What happens to galaxies when they die?","466","","<p>Stars explode when they die and blast heavy elements into space.  Do galaxies do the same thing?</p>
","<p>Well, it would be useful to define what a 'dead' galaxy is.  Probably the most simple method would be a galaxy that is no longer producing new stars.  We might also consider a galaxy that no longer produces significant light in the visual spectrum, or perhaps EMR across the entire spectrum.</p>

<p>Generally, there's unlikely to be a firm line between living and dead, and not nearly as dramatic as larger stars. More akin to watching a camp fire burn itself out.  Star formation is largely dependent available gases, but as more and more stars fuse those gases into heavier elements, there is less gas available for star formation. For your average sized galaxy, this will eventually result in running out of gas. Eventually the galaxy will dim and go dark, a process purported to begin at the center of the galaxy, where star formation is heaviest according to research based on Hubble images of giant galaxies. (Tacchella, et al.) The matter ought to (mostly) all still be there and still orbiting the (presumed) SMBH, but with no energy coming from fusion, it's going to be a dark, cold, and barren place. Sounds dead to me.</p>

<p>There are some complicating factors.  It's believed that encounters with nearby galaxies can affect available gases. The gravity from a larger galaxy could potentially strip the gases from a smaller one, a fatal blow for the smaller galaxy. Fortunately, it won't suffer much as the death will come (relatively) quickly. This process has been deemed 'strangulation' by a study published in Nature several <s>years</s> <s>months</s> days ago. (Ping, et al.) Note that as the study indicates, the methods of death are proposed solutions - not conclusive understanding of the exact processes that result in a galaxy's death.</p>

"Would a high albedo reflective substance cool down Venus?","465","","<p>If we were to put a highly reflective substance into Venus's upper atmosphere, could we cool it down?  I am envisioning adding a highly reflective fine dust or gas, possibly lighter than ""air"" to the atmosphere.  I believe to have the proper effect, it should also reflect infrared light, which causes heat.  Apparently Venus already has a high albedo of .75 (reflects 75% of light): <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/36833/albedo-of-venus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.universetoday.com/36833/albedo-of-venus/</a> .  However, if we were able to raise that higher, even up to 99%, would that cool it down, perhaps even making it habitable (temperature wise), or possibly even making it ice cold?</p>
","<p>Eventually, yes. </p>

<p>Interesting information about Venus: Venus is hotter than Mercury, despite being nearly twice as far from the Sun. Earth, despite being further from the Sun, receives <strong>more</strong>
energy from the Sun than Venus, due to Venus's very high albedo.</p>

<p>As you might guess by this information, the major factor that keeps Venus hot isn't how much energy it receives from the Sun, but rather its inability to rid itself of energy. While adding a cloud of some high albedo substance to the atmosphere may effectively prevent the Sun from heating Venus, it would also likely prevent infrared radiation from leaving Venus, thus keeping it warm.</p>

<p>As you know, Venus already has a very high albedo. It's thick atmosphere prevents energy from leaving the planet, which is what caused the temperature to rise far above the Earth-like temperatures we believe it once enjoyed. This is caused by IR radiation being emitted from the surface and being reflected back down towards the planet by the atmosphere <a href=""http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_is_infrared_radiation.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">more detail</a>, which plays an essential part in the greenhouse effect.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a more effectual method in terms of making it habitable would be to find a way to drastically <em>lower</em> the albedo of Venus to allow all the excess energy to escape.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ah, I just studied this about a week ago! What you're looking for is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_temperature"" rel=""nofollow"">effective temperature</a> of the planet, which can be calculated as
$$T=\left(\frac{L(1-A)}{16 \pi \sigma D^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}$$
where $L$ is the star's luminosity, $A$ is the planet's albedo, $\sigma$ is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_constant"" rel=""nofollow"">Stefan-Boltzmann constant</a>, and $D$ is the distance from the star.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how does the mass of a star relate to the distance of the frost line, and is there an already existing equation to estimate this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn't able to find an explicit equation for this, but it's calculable. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_(astrophysics)"" rel=""nofollow"">frost line</a> is a certain distance from a star in a stellar nebula such that the temperature is about 150 Kelvin.</p>

<p>If you know the mass of the star, you can use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93luminosity_relation"" rel=""nofollow"">mass-luminosity relation</a>:
$$\left(\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \right)=\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right)^a$$
Re-arrange that to solve for the luminosity. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law#Light_and_other_electromagnetic_radiation"" rel=""nofollow"">inverse-square law</a> says that the intensity of power drops off as the distance from the source increases:
$$I=\frac{P}{4 \pi r^2}$$
You can solve for $r$ if you can figure out the required intensity:
$$r=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{P}{\pi I}}$$
Here, $P \approx L$. Figure out the necessary intensity to heat the nebula to 150 K and you've found the frost line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To find the most likely average mass of a potential planet, what information would I need?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't help you much there, but I can give you a starter. The density $\rho$ of a circumstellar disk at a distance $r$ (as given by Michael Woolfson in <em>On the Origin of Planets</em>) is
$$\rho (r)=C \exp \left[-\frac{(r-r_{\text{peak}})^2}{2 \sigma ^2} \right]$$
where $\sigma$ is one standard deviation and $r_{\text{peak}}$ is the peak density, and $C$ is a constant.</p>

<p>As promised, here are some more, set forth by Woolfson.</p>

<p>The disk decays over time; its density at time $t$ is approximated by
$$\rho_t=\rho e^{- \gamma t}$$
where $\gamma$ is a decay constant. If you've taken certain math course, you've probably seen this equation many times before, just in with $\rho=y$ and $\gamma=k$.</p>

<p>Another equation - really, a couple equations - deal with accretion by a small dust particle in a circumstellar disk. The variables involved are: $m$ (mass of the particle), $t$ (time), $s$ (the radius of the particle), $\rho_s$ (the density of the particle), $\rho$ (the density of the disk), $f$ (the fraction of the medium that is dust), $T$ (the temperature), and $k$ (Boltzmann's constant, not be confused with the Stefan-Boltzmann constant).</p>

<p>The relevant pair of equations are:
$$\frac{dm}{dt}=4 \pi s^2 \rho_s \frac{ds}{dt}$$
$$\frac{ds}{dt}=\frac{3f \rho}{4} \left( \frac{kT}{4 \pi \rho_s^3} \right)^{1/2}s^{-3/2}$$
Using these, you can find the size and mass of a given dust particle at any given time.</p>

"Do blue giants have a habitable zone?","463","","<p>Or would the planet(s) need to be too far away for life to exist?</p>
","<p>Just because a planet is in the ""Habitable zone"" doesn't mean it is habitable. A planet is said to be in the habitable zone if it is possible for liquid water to exist on the surface. A planet may be in the habitable zone, and yet not be habitable if, for instance, it's atmospheric pressure is too low (like Mars) or too high (like Venus), both of which are in the habitable zone of the Sun.</p>

<p>A star may be unsuitable for life for other reasons: it may be prone to extreme flares, for example. A blue giant is a star that burns bright and dies young, only lasting a few million years. Planets around such a star would have only just formed (they may still have molten surfaces). Blue giants tend to be unstable, being variable over a range of timescales, and ejecting large amounts of matter into space.</p>

<p>So while there would be a region which is ""habitable"" in the sense that the surface temperature of a planet could be in the range 0-100, you wouldn't expect such a planet to actually be suitable for life.</p>

"What is the speed of time?","463","","<p>From the theory of relativity, if any object is moving with the speed of light or more than the speed of light, then the time stops or seemed to be stopped for that object.

<p>So what will be the speed of time for an object in the space, travelling at a negligible speed(i.e.,zero) or approximately stationary.</p>
","<p>The expression ""speed of time"" doesn't make much sense, since speed is the rate of change of position with time, and ""time"" doesn't have a position. Hence it doesn't have a speed.</p>

<p>If you want to know the amount of time dilation at a given speed, it is answered by special relativity. $t' = t\gamma $ where $t$ and $t'$ are the amount of time that passes in the two frames, and
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} $$</p>

<p>At low speeds, $\gamma$ is approximately 1, and at high speeds it approaches $\infty$. </p>

<p>To fit with your notion of the speed of time as being the relative rate of passing of time in the two frames, an expression for the speed of time would be $t/t' = 1/\gamma$, which is close to zero at high speeds, and close to 1 for low speeds. </p>

"Where does energy at the beginning of a star's lifecycle (before any nuclear reactions) come from?","463","","<p>David Christian's <a href=""http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520271449"" rel=""nofollow"">Maps of Time</a> has this to say about the period during which the first stars started to form from the diffuse clouds of hydrogen and helium that then made up the universe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under the pull of their own gravity, the clouds of hydrogen and helium began to collapse in on themselves...As gravity packed each cloud into ever smaller spaces, pressure built up in the center. Increasing pressure means increasing temperatures, and so, as they shrank, each gas cloud began to heat up (~Kindle location 1469).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The part I'm working on understanding is ""Increasing pressure means increasing temperatures."" Does the pressure itself cause the molecules to heat up? Or is it the kinetic energy that the particles pick up as gravity pulls them towards the center of the cloud? Or is the phenomenon here something other than increased energy per unit mass?</p>

<p>Of course, once the nuclear chain reaction gets started in the star it's not hard to figure out where the energy comes from. I'm talking about before that.</p>
","<p>This is basic thermodynamics.</p>

<p>When you compress a gas, you inject energy into it. Think of the pump you use to inflate the tires on your bike. It takes some force to move the piston, right? That effort is not wasted, but goes directly into the air in the pump. Now the air has more energy.</p>

<p>But what happens to a gas when you put energy into it? It's molecules jiggle around faster. Well, faster jiggling is basically the definition of higher temperature. By putting more energy into the gas, you raise its temperature.</p>

<p>You can actually tell that the bike pump is getting warmer if you pump quickly and forcefully - this is something you can experience yourself.</p>

<p>Same with stars - the whole star is the ""bike pump"", and gravity is the one who's pushing the piston. Due to compression (shrinking) under gravity, the gas gets hotter and hotter. It turns out a star has A LOT of gravitational energy, so the gas can get VERY hot.</p>

<p>In your terms, yes, it's the acceleration that molecules experience falling into the gravity well of the star that makes them move faster. Faster moving molecules = higher temperature. Pretty straightforward phenomenon, really.</p>

<hr>

<p>Historically, gravitational compression was thought to be the main source of energy for the stars, before the discovery of nuclear physics. Helmholtz and Lord Kelvin proposed this hypothesis in the 1800s.</p>

<p>The pressure-temperature relation of any gas was originally known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay-Lussac%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">the Gay-Lussac law</a>.

"Is the conversion from proto-star to main sequence an event or a process?","462","","<p>When a proto-star becomes a main sequence star, is that something that happens in an instant when a certain threshold is met, or is it a process that takes a few thousand/million years?</p>
","<p>Astronomers distinguish a prototstar from a star based on whether the object is visible. A protostar is hidden by the gas cloud that surrounds it. Protostars aren't visible. At some point in their evolution (and where this occurs depends on mass and metallicity), a protostar will start clearing the surrounding cloud of gas. This process happens very quickly from an astronomical point of view. (Aside: From a human point of view, this is anything but quickly.)</p>

<p>In the case of very massive stars, the newly emerged star is already on the main sequence. Very massive stars are ""stars"" (objects with a stable mass, stable size, and fusing hydrogen into helium) well before astronomers can see them. In contrast, very small stars spend hundreds of millions of years of evolution between being a ""star"" (visible to astronomers) and being on the main sequence. The star is a pre-main sequence star during this long span of time.</p>

<p>Intermediate mass stars also spend some time as a pre-main sequence star. How much time depends on mass and metallicity. In the case of a star with a mass of ~1 solar mass and metallicity comparable to that of the Sun, the time spent as a pre-main sequence star is on the order of tens of millions of years. In contrast, the time spent as a protostar is very short, tens of thousands of years. The time taken to clear the star system of gas (the transition from protostar to PMS star) is shorter yet, hundreds to a few thousand of years.</p>

<p>There is no point at which one can say fusion starts. It's a probabilistic thing, with probability increasing sharply with density and temperature. What about objects at the low end of density and temperature? This is the boundary that separates red dwarfs from brown dwarfs.</p>

<p>There is very little difference between the smallest red dwarfs and the largest brown dwarfs. The smallest red dwarfs are quite cool. They fuse hydrogen into helium via the <em>p-p</em> chain, but rather infrequently. The largest brown dwarfs also fuse hydrogen into helium via the <em>p-p</em> chain, but here the fusion reactions are so very infrequent that the brown dwarf gets cooler and cooler. In a trillion years, we might be able to point to a marked boundary between old red dwarfs and old brown dwarfs. Right now, that boundary is rather arbitrary.</p>

"Statistics of elements abundance in exoplanets","462","","<p>Recently, I encountered the concept of carbon planets - planets, which would be, unlike the Earth, formed mostly by carbon, instead of oxygen, silicon and magnesium. (I am not counting iron, which is mostly locked in the core). Now, I am interested in the planetary chemical compositions in general. I found interesting articles investigating the topic of variance of the planetary chemical compositions (for example <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/profile/D_Fischer/publication/230967637_The_Planet-Metallicity_Correlation/links/00b7d52be357729458000000.pdf"">here</a> or <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3253.pdf"">here</a>), but it is quite hard for me to make an overall picture of the state in the field.</p>

<p>I would like to ask on these things:</p>

<p><em>1. What typical compositions of terrestrial planets are expected to occur?</em> (I guess there will be plenty of correlations, some groups of elements occuring together as they are bound, for example to the CNO cycle or other nuclear cycle.)</p>

<p><em>2. How much different the chemical compositions of terrestrial planets really are?</em> (I.e. are all terrestrial planets mostly similar to each other, or should one rather expect that every planetary system has unique ratios of elements?)</p>
","<p>The observational determination of the chemical abundances in exoplanets is in its infancy. In terms of <em>terrestrial</em> type planets, i.e. those of size less than a few Earth radii, the constraints are confined to comparing the measured densities (obtained from the masses and radii of transiting planets found by Kepler and CoRoT) with models of what planets with certain assumed composition would look like. An excellent recent example of this can be found in <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...800..135D"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dressing et al. (2015)</a>. In this paper they make the claim that all of the low-mass
planets are consistent with a single, simple 2-component models (a mixture of 83% MgSiO$_3$ and 17% iron, but that this changes at higher masses, where more volatile elements or significant water are needed to explain their lower densities. The plot below, taken from that paper, illustrates the available data and should be quite up-to-date. Note how all the low-mass planets (and the Earth and Venus) can lie on the same family of models.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0pKj2.png"" alt=""Planet mass vs radius from Dressing et al. (2015)""></p>

<p>I don't think that the authors are claiming that this is exactly what all the planets are made of, but simply illustrating that at present there do not seem to be any large deviations from such a composition (for example, planets that are made solely of iron). </p>

<p>There are relatively few planets on this diagram, because it is difficult to obtain the masses of small transiting planets (it requires detection of the doppler shift caused by the pull of the planet on its host star).</p>

<p>Of course different models yield somewhat different results. For instance, <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...541A.103W"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wagner et al. (2012)</a> used the same data for Kepler-10b and CoRoT-7b and their own detailed models to argue that these planets have an iron core that makes up about 60% of the planet - i.e. a lot more than makes up the Earth.</p>

<p>At the moment the data for the lowest mass planets currently indicate that there <em>could</em> only be a limited amount of diversity. But the information that we are working with, the sample size, and the fact that only masses and radii are
determined, is too sparse to be sure.</p>

<p>From a theoretical point of view there are many ideas. The basic concept about the formation of the terrestrial-type planets is that they form (relatively) close in to the parent star and have compositions that are reflective of what elements and minerals can condense out of the protoplanetary disk at high temperatures. This in turn depends on the balance of elements that are present in the protoplanetary disk, where in the disk the planet forms, the detailed structure of the protoplanetary disk, how it cools and how planets migrate in the disk.  Unsurprisingly, by varying some of these conditions it is possible to create planets with a wide variety of compositions, which as I said above, appears to be mildly contradicted by the available evidence. At the most basic level we understand why the Earth and other terrestrial planets are comparatively lacking in ""volatile"" elements like hydrogen and helium (and to some extent C, N, O and noble gases), because they (or minerals containing them) could not condense at the high temperatures close to the proto-Sun.</p>

<p>Examples of these theoretical approaches can be found in <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...787...81M"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Moriarty et al. (2014)</a> (of which you are familiar), but also <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...747L...2C"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see Carter-Bond et al. (2012)</a> for examples of how chemical diversity might arise. It seems that the Mg/Si and the C/O ratios have the biggest influence on the final compositions of the formed planets. A low C/O ratio favours the formation of silicates and fewer carbon-carrying compounds; but if there is more carbon than oxygen then it becomes more favourable to form carbon and silicon-carbide (I guess this is what you mean by ""carbon planets""), but this also depends on the temperature in the region where the planet forms. For reference, the solar C/O ratio is 0.54 and the relative abundance of carbon in the Earth is much lower (than in the Sun) but the C/O ratio measured in other stars can be higher.</p>

"Do parallel universes exist?","461","","<p>Do other universes like ours exist?
If they exist, <strong>how do we know that they exist when we have even not seen the ends of our own universe?</strong></p>

<strong>We Don't Know</strong></p>

<p>Parallel universes may or may not exist. There is no definitive way to prove that these universes do or don't exist.</p>

<p>A parallel universe is a separate existence to ours. The Theories that suggest that there may be parallel universes are classified as theories of <strong>multiverses</strong>.

Can someone explain me how this works? It doesn't have to be numerical or with detailed formulas, just the idea what is going on. </p>
","<p>The key to understanding this is the concept of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_mechanism"" rel=""nofollow"">forbidden lines and forbidden transitions</a>.</p>

<p>A forbidden transition is one that cannot occur radiatively via an electric dipole interaction. Instead, it must proceed either through magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole emission, with <em>much</em> lower probability, or the transition may be accomplished through collisional (de)excitation. </p>

<p>A forbidden line is the radiation at a wavelength corresponding to a forbidden transition. In laboratory plasmas these are usually not seen - hence the term forbidden lines - because the transitions are normally accomplished through collisional de-excitation on a timescale much shorter than the radiative lifetime through magnetic dipole/electric quadrupole emission. However, in astrophysical plasmas the densities can be many orders of magnitude lower than even the best laboratory vacuums. In this case, forbidden lines <em>are</em> seen and indeed are often an important means of radiative cooling.</p>

<p>The property of forbidden lines which makes them an excellent density-sensitive tool is that they can be ""quenched"" if the density becomes large enough to make collisional de-excitation more probable than radiative de-excitation. The strength of the forbidden line is thus sensitive to the electron density (which is what dominates the collisions) between densities where ""quenching"" starts to become effective and higher densities where the line essentially becomes unobservable.</p>

<p>Taking the specific example of OIII (doubly ionised oxygen) optical line emission. There are three forbidden transitions of interest between the $^1D_2 \rightarrow\ ^3P_2$ (501 nm), $^1D_2 \rightarrow\ ^3P_1$ (496 nm) and $^1S_0 \rightarrow\ ^1D_2$ (436 nm) states.
These transitions produce optical forbidden lines which are quenched at different characteristic densities. Measuring a line strength <em>ratio</em> is important because the ratio will be <em>independent</em> of the abundance of OIII. The ratio will depend on electron density, providing the electron density is $&gt;10^{5}\ cm^{-3}$, <em>and</em> temperature (at lower densities, the ratio is just temperature dependent).</p>

<p>To get the density in this case requires more information - usually supplied by a similar line ratio for something like NII, which has a similar set of forbidden lines, but with differing density and temperature dependence.</p>

<p>A more straightforward route is to use the line ratio for forbidden lines of OII or SII where there are a closely spaced pair of energy levels, both undergoing forbidden transitions to the same lower level. In this case the ratios are density sensitive, but not temperature sensitive, again over a range of densities where one or other of the transitions is in the process of being quenched (e.g. for OII 372.6/372.8nm, $10^2 &lt;n_e &lt; 10^{6}\ cm^{-3}$.)</p>

I'm putting together a presentation on Milankovitch Cycles, and I would like to bring up the difference in distance to the sun (km) at aphelion and perihelion when the earths orbit is at maximum and minimum eccentricity. The numbers I've found are that the maximum eccentricity of Earth's orbit is 0.0679, and the minimum is 0.000055.</p>
","<p>I like the math of ellipses cause there's enough parts to keep it interesting, but it's not super complex either.   The answer to your question as you put it, is remarkably simple.  I've bolded the letters that represent distances for easier reading.</p>

<p>Eccentricity or $e = c/a$, where $a$ is the semi major axis and $c$ is the distance between the focal point (sun's location) and the center of the ellipse. $ea$ is the distance between the center point and the focal point.</p>

<p>So, the answer to your question is simply $a$ plus $ea$ and $a$ minus $ea$.   For the Earth and sun, the semi major axis or $a$, is $149,600,000\:\mathrm{km}$, then simply add and subtract $ea$ to both.</p>

<p>When $e = .0679$, $ea = 10.15\:\mathrm{million\:km}$. So $149,600,000 \pm 10,150,000$. $159,750,000$ and $139,450,000\:\mathrm{km}$ at furthest and closest.</p>

<p>When $e = .000055$, $ea = .008\:\mathrm{million\:km}$, so $149,680,000$ and $149,520,000$ at most circular.</p>

"What are the arguments against the Feng and Gallo thin disk explanation of galactic rotation curves?","454","","<p>The well-known <strong>galaxy rotation problem</strong> is described <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Basically (as one moves outward from the galactic centre, $R$ increasing) the <strong>observed</strong> pattern of variation in orbital speed $V$ is very different from the pattern <strong>expected</strong> on the basis of the distribution of mass inferred from detectable radiation. This is illustrated by the two curves in the following figure.
<img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/M33_rotation_curve_HI.gif/420px-M33_rotation_curve_HI.gif"" alt=""galactic rotation curve""></p>

<p><strong>Feng and Gallo</strong> in several papers such as <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3778"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this 2010 article</a> have proposed a method for modelling mass distributions in discoidal galaxies.  The method can be applied to an individual galaxy to produce a ""tailor-made"" mass distribution which (by applying basic Newtonian physics) predicts a galactic rotation curve matching the curve observed for the galaxy. They explain the failure of other attempts, using ""ordinary"" physics, to predict observed galactic rotations on the use of crude luminosity:mass assumptions and on the inappropriate application of Keplerian models to galaxies.</p>

<p>""Mysterious"" explanations of the galaxy rotation problem such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dark Matter</a>  and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MOND</a> are still being considered seriously. Presumably therefore Feng and Gallo's ideas are not widely accepted.  What are the reasons for the rejection of their explanations?</p>
","<p>Feng &amp; Gallo have published a series of extremely similar papers, all of which essentially claim that they have ""discovered"" a major flaw in the way (some) astrophysicists think about rotation curves. Instead of assuming spherical symmetry, they try to solve for the mass distribution, using a rotation curve, without assuming spherical symmetry, instead adopting a planar geometry with cylindrical symmetry.</p>

<p>Of course they <em>do</em> have a point; statements that the flat rotation curve can be compared with a Keplerian prediction (that assume spherical symmetry, or that all the mass is concentrated at the centre) are overly simplistic. So far so good, but they then go on to claim that their analysis is compatible with the total <em>stellar</em> mass of galaxies and that dark matter is not required.</p>

<p>So, in their planar model (and obviously this is open to criticism too) they invert rotation curves to obtain a radially dependent surface density distribution that drops pseudo-exponentially.</p>

<p>Problem 1: They concede (e.g. in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3236"" rel=""nofollow"">Feng &amp; Gallo 2011</a>) that ""the surface mass density decreases toward the galactic periphery at a slower rate than that of the luminosity density. In other words, the mass-to-light ratio in a disk galaxy is not a constant"". This is an understatement! They find exponential scale lengths for the mass that are <em>around twice</em> (or more for some galaxies) the luminosity scalelengths, so this implies a <em>huge, unexplained</em> increase in the average mass to light ratio of the stellar population with radius. For the Milky way they give a luminosity scalelength of 2.5 kpc and a mass scale length of 4.5 kpc, so the $M/L$ ratio goes as $\exp[0.18r]$, with radius in kpc (e.g. increases by a factor 4 between 2 kpc and 10 kpc). They argue this may be due to the neglect in their model of the galactic bulge, but completely fail to explain how this could affect the mass-to-light ratio in such an extreme way.</p>

<p>Problem 2: In their model they derive a surface mass density of the disk in the solar vicinity as between 150-200 $M_{\odot}/pc^2$. Most ($\sim 90$%) of the stars in the solar neighbourhood are ""thin disk"" stars, with an exponential scale height of between $z_0= 100-200$pc. If we assume the density distribution is exponential with height above the plane and that the Sun is near the plane (it is actually about 20pc above the plane, but this makes little difference), a total surface mass density of $\sigma = 200M_{\odot}/pc^2$ implies a local volume mass density of $\rho \simeq \sigma/2z_0$, which is of order $0.5-1 M_{\odot}/pc^3$ for the considered range of possible scale heights.  The <em>total</em> mass density in the Galactic disk near the Sun, derived from the dynamics of stars observed by Hipparcos, is $0.076 \pm 0.015 M_{\odot}/pc^3$  (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998A%26A...329..920C"" rel=""nofollow"">Creze et al. 1998</a>), <em>which falls short by an order of magnitude</em>. (This does not bother the cold, baryonic dark matter model because the additional (dark) mass is not concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy).</p>

<p>Problem 3: For the most truncated discs that they consider with an edge at $r=15$ kpc, the total Galaxy mass is $1.1\times10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$ (again from <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3236"" rel=""nofollow"">Feng &amp; Gallo 2011</a> ). The claim is then that this ""is in very good agreement with the Milky Way <em>star counts</em> of 100 billion (Sparke &amp; Gallagher 2007)"". I would not agree. Assuming ""stars"" covers the full stellar mass range, then I wouldn't dissent from the 100 billion number; but the average stellar mass is about $0.2\ M_{\odot}$ (e.g. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003PASP..115..763C"" rel=""nofollow"">Chabrier 2003</a>), so this implies $\sim 5$ times as much mass as there is in stars (i.e. essentially the same objection as problem 2, but now integrated over the Galaxy). Gas might close this gap a little, white dwarfs/brown dwarfs make minor/negligible contributions, but we still end up requiring some ""dark"" component that dominates the mass, even if not as extreme as the pseudo-spherical dark matter halo models. Even if a factor of 5 additional baryonic dark matter (gas, molecular material, lost golf balls) were found this still leaves the problem of points 1 and 2 - why does this dark matter not follow the luminous matter and why does it not betray its existence in the kinematics of objects perpendicular to the disc. </p>

<p>Problem 4: Feng &amp; Gallo do not include any discussion or consideration of the more extended populations of the Milky Way. In particular they do not consider the motions of distant globular clusters, halo stars or satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, which can be at 100-200 kpc from the Galactic centre (e.g. <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/785/1/63?rel=sem&amp;relno=2"" rel=""nofollow"">Bhattachargee et al. 2014</a>). At these distances, any mass associated with the luminous matter in the disk at $r \leq 15$ kpc <em>can</em> be well approximated using the Keplerian assumption. Proper consideration of these seems to suggest a much larger <em>minimum</em> mass for the Milky way independently of any assumptions about its distribution, though perhaps not in the inner (luminous) regions where dark matter appears not to be dominant and which is where F&amp;G's analysis takes place. i.e the factor of 5-10 ""missing"" mass referred to above may be quite consistent with what others say about the total disk mass and the required dark matter <em>within 15kpc</em> of the Galactic centre (e.g. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...794...59K"" rel=""nofollow"">Kafle et al. 2014</a>). To put it another way, the dynamics of these very distant objects require a large amount of mass in a spherical Milky Way halo, way more than the luminous matter and way more even than derived by Feng &amp; Gallo. For instance, Kafle et al. model the mass (properly, using the Jeans equation) as a spheroidal bulge, a disk and a spherical (dark) halo using the velocity dispersions of halo stars out to 150 kpc. They find the total Galaxy mass is $\sim 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ and about 80-90% is in the spherical dark halo. Yet this dark halo makes almost no contribution to the mass density in the disk near the Sun.</p>

<p>Problem 5: (And to be fair I do think this is beyond the scope of what Feng &amp; Gallo are doing) Feng &amp; Gallo treat this problem in isolation without considering how their rival ideas might impact on all the other observations that non-baryonic dark matter was brought in to solve. Namely, the dynamics of galaxies in clusters, lensing by clusters, the CMB ripples, structure formation and primordial nucleosynthesis abundances to state the obvious ones. A new paradigm needs to do at least as well as the old one in order to be considered competitive.</p>

  substantial amount of mass in the bulge that is offset from the line</p>

<p>On the other hand, this academical <a href=""http://www.lhup.edu/%7Edsimanek/scenario/tides.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a>

  crosses our meridian before we experience the highest tide.</strong>] How
  early? Some books show misleading diagrams with the symmetry axis of

<p>Can you say what is the real position of the bulge? it is surely a hard fact not open to interpretations. Do you have access to sites that say where is now the moon and where is the tidal bulge?</p>

<p>According to the basic laws of conservation of momentum and energy, a mass moving to a greater radius should be slowed downm and if we add friction the lag of 12 minutes or more makes sense.

","<p>There is no great contradiction. The offset of the tidal bulge is about 3 degrees. It is exaggerated in diagrams for clarity. The diagram is correct, but not to scale.</p>

<p>This causes the tides to be slightly <strong>late</strong>. Imagine a person standing on the Earth of the diagram, with the moon directly overhead. The tidal bulge is on their left. The rotation of the Earth will take them towards the left (the moon is also orbiting but its motion is much slower), so a little later (12 min later) they will reach the maximum of the tide. The maximum is delayed by about 12 min.</p>

<p>Actual flows of water around the coast are driven by this tidal bulge, but are complex effects of local topography.

","<p>Observing the Sun through a telescope is very dangerous, whatever the telescope you use, if you don't use the appropriate tools.</p>

<p>You may have already tried to make the Sun light converge through a little magnifying glass (which works quite similarly to a telescope).

Optical depth is a unitless number that defines one's ability to ""see"" through a gas (or plasma). An optical depth of 1 or higher means the gas is opaque and cannot be seen through. An optical depth less than one means the gas is transparent and can be seen through.</p>

<p>However, when you have something the Sun or even fog, the optical depth varies with the distance you're looking into that object. I'll talk about fog since it's familiar, but the same idea applies to the Sun's atmosphere. Say you're standing in a forrest and its very foggy out. There's a tree 1 meter away from you that you can see. You could measure your optical depth, $\tau$, of the fog between you and tree and might find that $\tau = 0.15$. Since $\tau$ is less than one, that implies you can see the tree, but the value of $\tau$ also implies how well you can see it. If $\tau = 0$, there's nothing between you and the tree to impede your ability to see it. Let's say there's another tree that's 5 meters away. Now there's more fog between you and the tree and while you can still see it, it is harder to see it. The optical depth of the fog between you and the tree 5 meters away might be $\tau = 0.75$. It's still less than one, implying the tree is visible, but because there's more fog between you and the tree, the optical depth is higher. Finally, there may be a tree 10 meters away with so much fog between you and the tree that the optical depth is $\tau = 1.5$. You can't see this tree because there's too much fog in the way. Hopefully you now realize that anything which is at a distance where $\tau &gt; 1$ is not visible to you. That effectively defines a ""surface"" around you precisely when $\tau = 1$. Anything beyond that point is not visible and anything closer is visible.</p>

<p>If you're talking about the Sun, you can look at the Sun, but you'll only see light which originates from a point where $\tau &lt; 1$. There are countless photons bouncing around inside the Sun, but you can't see them because they're in an opaque part of the Sun. Astronomers use the optical depth as a metric for defining the ""surface"" of the Sun.</p>

<p><sub>Keep in mind the above description is highly simplified, almost to the point of being wrong. The optical depth is a useful metric for defining a surface, but it doesn't imply there's an exact radius for the surface or even that the surface is constant for every wavelength. There are a lot of other factors that make this much more complicated than I'm describing here. Hopefully you get the general idea though.</sub></p>

<h3>The Sun's atmosphere</h3>

<p>For the Sun, the atmosphere would be anything above the surface. Nominally the surface is defined as the point where the $\tau = 2/3$ (despite what I said above, and for reasons I won't go into here). The atmosphere above this surface is complicated and difficult to study. The atmosphere, just above the surface, is violent, turbulent, filled with outbursts and magnetic fields, and <em>extremely</em> hot. Below are some pictures of this region of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the Sun extends far beyond that though. In fact, Earth is currently moving through the Sun's atmosphere. It's very tenuous out near Earth, but still exists. The Sun's atmosphere hitting our planet is the reason for aurora. Beyond the lower portions, the atmosphere is generally referred to as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"" rel=""noreferrer"">Solar Wind</a>. This solar wind actually extends far out, beyond Pluto even. Exactly how far is difficult to define, but estimates place our Sun's atmosphere extending out to about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_shocks_in_astrophysics#Around_the_Sun"" rel=""noreferrer"">$\sim230\:\mathrm{AU}$</a>. At that point is the bow shock, where our Sun's atmosphere slams into the interstellar medium surrounding us.</p>

<p>Our own Sun's atmosphere is hard to study on a large scale since we're inside it, but we have been able to observe this bow shock around other stars, as shown below.</p>

"Are white dwarf stars supported by proton degeneracy as well?","451","","<p>In general, fermions form a degenerate gas under high density or extremely low temperature. It's clear that white dwarf stars are supported by electron degeneracy pressure. However, there are still a significant number of protons in a white dwarf. Under those high densities, do the protons form a degenerate gas?</p>

<p>In addition, are white dwarfs supported by proton degeneracy pressure as much as they are by electron degeneracy pressure?</p>
","<p>Straightforwardly no.</p>

<p>For a start there are almost no free protons inside a white dwarf. They are all safely locked away in the nuclei of carbon and oxygen nuclei (which are bosonic).
There are a few protons near the surface, but not in sufficient numbers to be degenerate.</p>

<p>Let us assume though that you were able to build a hydrogen white dwarf that had equal numbers of free protons and electrons.</p>

<p>The density at which the electrons become degenerate is set by the requirement that their Fermi (kinetic) energy exceeds $kT$. The Fermi energy is given by
$$E_F = \frac{p_F^{2}}{2m} = \left(\frac{3}{8\pi}\right)^{2/3} n^{2/3} \left(\frac{h^2}{2m}\right),$$
where $n$ is the number density (which would be the same for protons and electrons), but $m$ is the mass of a proton or electron, which is different by a factor 1800.</p>

<p>Thus for a given white dwarf temperature, the electrons become degenerate at number densities a factor of $(m_p/m_e)^{3/2} = 78,600$ times lower than do protons.</p>

<p>Even if we were to compress a hypothetical hydrogen white dwarf to the point where the protons were also degenerate (which for a typical white dwarf interior temperature of $10^{7}$ K, would need mass densities considerably in excess of $10^{12}$ kg/m$^{3}$), the (ideal) degeneracy pressures would then be given by
$$ P = \frac{h^2}{20m}\left(\frac{3}{\pi}\right)^{2/3} n^{5/3}$$
and so we immediately see that the degeneracy pressure due to protons would be $\sim 1800$ times less than that due to the same number density of electrons.</p>

<p>If we push up to higher densities then both the protons and electrons will become <em>relativistically</em> degenerate. In this case the pressure becomes <em>independent of the particle mass</em>. However, the Fermi energies of the particles would now be high enough ($&gt;1$ GeV !) to block beta decay and instigate neutronisation. The protons and electrons start combining to form neutrons and an n,p,e fluid is formed where the neutrons vastly outnumber the protons and electrons. This in fact prevents the protons ever becoming relativistic, even at neutron star densities, and the contributions of electrons to the pressure is <em>always</em> orders of magnitude higher than for the protons.</p>

<p>A <strong>handwaving</strong> way of understanding this is that the degeneracy pressure depends on the <em>product</em> of the momentum and velocity of the particles. In turn, the momentum of the fermions depends on how much they are compressed through the uncertainty principle. For a given particle number density, the separation $\Delta x$ is the same for protons and electrons and therefore the uncertainty principle says that the $\Delta p \sim \hbar/\Delta x$ of the momentum is also the same. This is another way of saying that the Fermi momentum does <em>not</em> depend on the mass of the fermion; however, for a given fermion momentum, the velocity clearly does! Therefore the degeneracy pressure must be lower by approximately the mass ratio of the fermions</p>

"What are the maximum and minimum impact speeds for an asteroid that would strike the Earth?","451","","<p>I gather that the impact speed depends on the radius of the orbit of the asteroid.</p>

<p>Is the orbit of asteroids in the same direction around the sun, or can they move in the ""opposite"" direction?</p>
","<p>Although most objects orbit the Sun in the same direction — having emerged out of the same rotating gas cloud that spawned the Solar System — some asteroids and other <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_planet"" rel=""noreferrer"">minor planets</a> do move in opposite, or <em>retrograde</em>, orbits (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exceptional_asteroids#Retrograde"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Wikipedia article</a> for a list of such objects).</p>

<p>The minimum speed for an asteroid is achieved if it has more or less the same velocity around the Sun as the Earth. In this case the gravitational attraction of Earth will accelerate the object to the escape velocity of Earth, i.e.
$$
v_\mathrm{min} = v_{\mathrm{esc,}\oplus} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus}} \simeq 11\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}.
$$
Here, $G$, $M_\oplus$, and $R_\oplus$ are the gravitational constant and the mass and radius of Earth, respectively.</p>

<p>The maximum speed is achieved at a ""head-on"" collision. Earth's speed around the Sun is
$$
v_{\mathrm{orb,}\oplus} = \sqrt{\frac{GM_\odot}{d}} \simeq 30\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1},
$$
where $M_\odot$ and $d$ are the mass of the Sun and the distance from Sun to Earth (1 AU).</p>

<p>If the asteroid travels on the same orbit, but in the opposite direction, the impact will then be at 60 km/s. However, if the asteroid comes from far away (e.g. the Oort Cloud), it will be accelerated by the Sun and achieve a velocity equal to <em>the escape velocity from the Sun at the location of Earth</em>. As is seen from the two equations above, the orbital speed and the escape velocity differ by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. That is, an object falling from infinity toward the Sun, will have a speed equal to $30\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\times\sqrt{2}=42\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ when it reaches Earth.</p>

<p>Hence, the maximum impact velocity is
$$
v_\mathrm{max} = 30\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 42\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 72\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}.

"Sun's apparent magnitude at 2.5 AU?","450","","<p>Imagine an astronaut standing on an asteroid 2.5 A.U. distant from the Sun. He is gazing, naked-eye, towards the Sun.

<p>What is the apparent magnitude of the Sun at that distance, and is that bright enough to blot out any of the inner planets? No light blockers and solely viewing with the Eyeball Mark I?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What is the apparent magnitude of the Sun at that distance?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, there's a formula known as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_modulus"" rel=""noreferrer"">Distance Modulus</a> which is defined to calculate precisely this information. The equation is given by</p>

<p>$$m-M=5\log_{10}(d_{pc}) - 5$$</p>

<p>where $m$ is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"" rel=""noreferrer"">apparent magnitude</a> of your star, $M$ is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude"" rel=""noreferrer"">absolute magnitude</a>, and $d$ is the distance from the star, in units of $\mathrm{parsecs}$. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is easily looked up and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=absolute%20magnitude%20sun&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8"" rel=""noreferrer"">found to be</a> $M_\odot = 4.83$. The distance, you provide as $2.5\:\mathrm{AU} = 1.2120342\times10^{-5}\:\mathrm{pc}$. Now its simple to solve for $m$.</p>

<p>$$m = 5\log_{10}(1.2120342\times10^{-5}) - 5 + 4.83$$</p>

<p>$$m = -24.75$$</p>

<p>As far as apparent magnitudes go, this is still pretty bright. You can see a table of typical apparent magnitudes for comparison <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude#Table_of_notable_celestial_objects"" rel=""noreferrer"">right here</a>. Interestingly, this table lists $-25$ as the ""minimum brightness that causes the typical eye slight pain to look at"". At $m=-24.75$ (remember higher value = less bright) you'd be just above this threshold and so the Sun would be safe to look at without causing eye strain or pain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is that bright enough to blot out any of the inner planets?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to determine the the brightness of the inner planets, we have to do some more math. Unfortunately, people don't really calculate the absolute magnitudes of planets so the form of the distance modulus listed above isn't entirely useful. Instead, we'll use a different form.</p>

<p>$$m_1 - m_2 = -5\log_{10}\left(\frac{d_2}{d_1}\right)$$</p>

<p>This equation relates an object with an apparent magnitude of $m_1$ at a distance $d_1$ to its apparent magnitude $m_2$ at a distance $d_2$. If we look up the apparent magnitude of the various inner systems from Earth, and figure out their distance from Earth at those times, we can figure out the apparent magnitude at the distance of your asteroid.</p>

<p>I'll work this out for Venus since Venus will likely be one of the brightest of the inner planets (given its high <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo"" rel=""noreferrer"">albedo</a>). Venus as viewed from Earth, at its brightest, has an apparent magnitude of $m_1 = −4.89$. This occurs when it is an the point of greatest elongation. As determined from this <a href=""https://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/Solar"" rel=""noreferrer"">solar system orrery</a>, the distance is approximately $d_1 = 0.75\:\mathrm{AU} = 0.36\times10^{-5}\:\mathrm{pc}$. On your asteroid, you'll be about $d_2 = 2.17\:\mathrm{AU} = 1.05\times10^{-5}\:\mathrm{pc}$ from Venus at the same point of maximum brightness (based on a little trig). From this we can calculate $m_2$ to be</p>

<p>$$m_2 = −4.89 + 5\log_{10}\left(\frac{1.05\times10^{-5}\:\mathrm{pc}}{0.36\times10^{-5}\:\mathrm{pc}}\right) = -2.57$$</p>

<p>From the comparison table listed above, this would make Venus, at its brightest, about as dim as the ""minimum brightness of the Moon"". This is a rough calculation, but I don't expect the actual answer to vary too much from this value.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, that's the maximum brightness of one of the brightest inner planets. Any other time Venus will be dimmer and all other planets will never be brighter than this. So all in all, the inner planets will likely be outshined by the much brighter Sun. There's a chance, with the right conditions, if you managed to properly block the light from the Sun using some sort of occulting disk or <a href=""https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/1015/"" rel=""noreferrer"">flower starshade</a>, that you could see the inner planets with the naked eye as they still would be pretty bright in their own right. You just need to get rid of the sunlight outshining them. </p>

"Will Sirius B start accreting from A and become a supernova type Ia?","450","","<p>Sirius B is a massive white dwarf of 1 Solar mass, orbiting at about 25 AU distance from the 2 Solar mass Sirius A. As it evolves and expands, will the A star start shedding matter to the white dwarf, and when will this start happening? Will the Sun be at a safe distance when/if it does happen, or is Sirius our doom?</p>
","<p>Will Sirius B start accreting? Yes, it is doing so now. Sirius A will have a wind and some of that wind will be captured by the white dwarf.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of wind capture is a strong function of relative wind speed. An analytic approximation to the accretion rate, known as <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_accretion"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bondi-Hoyle accretion</a>, goes as the inverse cube of the relative speed. In its present evolutionary state, the mass loss from Sirius A will be relatively weak (like the Sun) and relatively fast (like the Sun). This disfavours any significant accretion by the white dwarf.</p>

<p>However, in the later stages of its life, Sirius A will swell to become an asymptotic giant star. The envelopes of such stars are gradually (on timescales of millions of years) blown away quite slowly by a dusty wind. If Sirius A is around 2 solar masses now, it will lose about 1.4 solar masses during this phase at speeds of only 10-20 km/s. </p>

<p>Only <em>a fraction</em> of this mass may be accreted by the white dwarf, because the separation between the stars is still large compared with the likely terminal size of Sirius A (probably of order 2 au). If you look at the <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_lobe"" rel=""noreferrer"">likely Roche lobe size</a>, then Roche lobe overflow would require A to reach about 40% of the separation, which isn't going to happen. Exactly what fraction <em>is</em> captured by the less efficient wind accretion process (the majority will likely disappear into space <em>and</em> widen the orbit) depends strongly on the wind speed, which is hard to predict. </p>

<p>Even if Sirius B could accrete the 0.35-0.4 solar masses (I think that is unlikely, but lack the wherewithal to do the hydrodynamic simulation) it needs to become unstable, it is not clear if that mass will ""stick"". A build up of hydrogen-rich material can ignite and explode in a nova (not supernova) on the surface of a white dwarf, causing mass loss!</p>

<p>Finally, when will this happen? Well Sirius is probably about 300 million years old now and has another perhaps 500 million years before it starts to evolve in the way I described. It will be nowhere near the Sun then.</p>

"If the moon wasn't receding from Earth, what would be the impact on the weather and tides?","449","","<p>Moon is slowly receding from Earth, which means that after its formation it was much closer to the Earth than now. How would weather look like if it wasn't receding at it would be now as close as at the beginning?</p>

<p>Surely, the tides would be much higher, but how big would be the difference? I've also watched document stating that the hurricanes would be much stronger. Was there any simulations, how much stronger they would be?</p>
","<p>Tidal amplitudes roughly scale inversely with distance to the fourth power (this comes from the tidal force scaling as $r^{-3}$ and the Earth's potential scaling as $r^{-1}$). At its formation, the Moon <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ARA&amp;A..42..441C"" rel=""nofollow"">was approximately seven Earth radii away from Earth</a>, or about ten times closer than it is today. Thus, the amplitude of the tide on Earth would have been approximately $10^4$ times larger than it is today. As the typical ocean tide is 1&nbsp;m, this means ocean tides would have been 10&nbsp;km high on Earth! Of course, the collision that formed the moon turned the surface of the Earth molten, so really we're talking about a 10&nbsp;km tall molten tide, which is far less scary...(kidding).</p>

<p>Imagine all the noise the ocean makes when it crashes on a beach. That noise requires energy to produce, and is partially driven by the action of raising/lowering the ocean via tides. Now imagine how loud a 10 km wave crashing would be. This is why the Moon receded quite quickly from the Earth shortly after forming, the tides enable the dissipation of a <strong>lot</strong> of orbital energy.</p>

<p>As for the hypothetical effect of this supertide on the present-day Earth's weather, the Earth's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere"" rel=""nofollow"">troposphere</a> (which contains pretty much all of the Earth's weather phenomena) extends 10&ndash;20&nbsp;km from the ground.

"The role of gravity during planetesimal accretion","449","","<p>As far as I understand, during the formation of a planetary disc, grains of dust stick together due to collisions and chemical bonding. Considering the size of the grain - say, 1 mm - and the speed - 1cm per sec - it would seem that gravity plays a minor role during accretion. My question is, to what extent is gravity a factor during accretion? To what extent is it related to fragmentation? In other words - how does gravity affect whether the fragments return and stick to the main body? Is there a size barrier, or is it dependent only on the speed?</p>
","<p>The very first stage of planet formation involves purely inelastic (i.e., sticky) collisions between pairs of small particles of dust to make slightly larger particles of dust, pairwise collisions between these slightly larger particles to make even larger particles, and so on. So far, the only gravitation that comes into play is that of the central protostar and the disk as a whole. The gravitation of these little objects is very small.</p>

<p>Then some magic happens that makes the little rocks that result from this very first stage grow into planetesimals that do gravitate. How do little rocks (a few centimeters in diameter) grow into little planetesimals (a few hundred meters in diameter)?  This is the key open problem in the theory of planet formation.</p>

<p>The core of the problem is that objects the size of a spec of dust to an object the size of a small pebble move with the gas that forms the bulk of the disk. The outward pressure from the gas in the disk makes the gas and small objects move at a slightly less than orbital speed. Once an object reaches the centimeter scale or so, the pressure from the gas no longer provides the support needed to keep those objects moving at that slightly suborbital speed. The objects start to become separated from the gas. By the time an object reaches a meter or so in diameter, the gas is equivalent to a hurricane force headwind.</p>

<p>One consequence of this is that collisions become ever more violent as objects grow beyond a centimeter in size, and hence are more likely to break colliding objects apart than to make them coalesce. An even bigger problem is that that headwind makes centimeter- to meter-sized objects spiral into the protostar, and very quickly (a few hundred years from 1 AU). A number of proposals have been put forth to overcome this meter barrier problem. So far, none appears to have stuck. (Sorry for the pun.)</p>

<p>Once objects reach some critical size, the drag from the gas reduces in importance thanks to the square-cube law and the gravitational attraction increases. That critical size varies from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers, depending on which paper one reads (experts vary). These objects are ""planetesimals,"" and there are lots of them. These once again combine readily to make planetary embryos. From then on, its just a mopping up process as gravitation either makes these planetesimals / planetary embryos combine or ejects them from the star system.</p>

"Why do medium stars collapse to form supernovae while big stars collapse to form black holes?","448","","<p>I understand that a star runs out of fuel slowly and gradually by fusing heavier and heavier particles (because of pressure by gravity) until the last heaviest particle is not able to fuse at the core of the star. This is where gravity takes over, and mass collapses (emitting gases out) to become a smaller dense star (with no energy left to give, just the gravity to absorb). </p>

<p>What I don't understand is why medium stars collapse to become a supernova which emits light while big stars collapse to form black holes which absorb all light.</p>
","<p>There are 2 main kinds of supernova.  The kind you are referring to is a <strong>type 2</strong> supernova.  There are also type 1a, type 1b, and type 1c supernova.  Type 1a supernova are not caused by the implosion of huge stars, but rather, a white dwarf accumulating ever greater amounts of mass from a companion star until the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chandrasekhar limit</a> for mass is reached.  Then we get the type 1a supernova, which leaves little core remnant and is more or less constant sized explosion with standard luminosity.  This is the reason type 1a supernova are used as standard candles to gauge the distance of objects in the universe.</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/21641/why-do-medium-stars-collapse-to-form-supernovae-while-big-stars-collapse-to-form/21643#21643"">David Hammen's answer</a> has pointed out, type 2 supernova endings occur only for stars that are more than 8x our sun's mass. Neutron stars and black holes are remnants left post-supernova, after the outer layers and majority of star has has blown off.  The size of the remnant is  predictable to an extent pre-supernova and depends on the mass of the star.  However this is only an approximation and there are always exceptions as the physics is complex and depends on too many variables. Type 1 supernovas leave little of no remnant.</p>

<p><strong>Cause of Type 2 Supernova:</strong></p>

<p>So what causes a dying star of said mass or greater to blow itself up to smitherines in such a way that more energy is released in the short span of the explosion that that of an entire galaxy for same time period.  This is in contrast to the much more docile, gradual, and protracted conclusion of stars whose mass is less than 8xSun;  planetary nebula after a red giant collapse and leaves white dwarf as remnant.</p>

<p><strong>Massive Star Pre-Supernova</strong>(type 2) and implosion:</p>

<p>The core of a massive star will accumulate iron and heavier elements which are not exo-thermically fusible.  Iron is the end of the exothermic fusion chain. Any fusion to heavier nuclei will be endothermic.  Endothermic fusion absorbs energy from the surrounding layer causing it to cool down and condense around the core further.  This added inward pressure is in addition to the inward pressure of gravity and causes a gradient where the core continues to collapse and get denser while exothermic fusion maintains expansive outward pressure above the gradient.   </p>

<p>When the density of the inner core reaches a point where the pressure overcomes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">electron degeneration pressure</a>.  Then another gradient is formed where inside the gradient atoms no longer exists because the electrons of the atoms will join their nucleus. The protons in the nucleus combine with the electrons to become neutrons, and release neutrinos.  There will be no more individual atoms inside of this gradient.  The sudden collapse inside the electron degeneration pressure gradient of the core triggers the initial supernova implosion as said core collapses in a few seconds to a tiny point object of nuclear density (3×10<sup>17</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>) no bigger than <a href=""http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/NeutronStars/index.php/neutron-star-radii/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Manhattan</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Supernova Explosion:</strong>  </p>

<p>The sudden in-rush of both the heavy element core outside the electron degeneration gradient, and the exotherimically fusible outer layers of the star cause immense heat and pressure in a few seconds period of time causing much of the lighter than iron elements to simultaneously fuse all at once.</p>

<pre><code>**Anti-Matter:**
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the extremely dense and energetic neutrino flux would be rushing outward from the mentioned EDP core collapse.  When the neutrinos encounter head on the equally energetic atomic nuclei rushing  inwards the following occurs:</p>

<p>When a neutron absorbs a neutrino, antimatter is formed as neutrons become anti-protons and positrons.
When this Anti-Matter encounters normal matter, we have the most efficient and complete mass to energy conversion possible: 
Matter-AntiMatter Annihilation  (MAMA).</p>

<p>The combination of the simultaneous fusion and the MAMA causes all hell to break loose in the greatest release of energy in the shortest time, 2nd only to the gamma ray burst, known in the universe.</p>

<p><strong>Remnant Post-Supernova:</strong></p>

<p>What is left behind after most of the star has blown off is a solid extremely dense mass of neutrons around the size of Manhattan.  Thus the term neutron star.</p>

<p>There is nothing denser than a neutron star. (See note below) It is just pure mass with no empty space left. To get a perspective what we are taking about here, our normal atom on earth is almost all empty space. If we take the simplest atom which is hydrogen, and the nucleus (one proton) was scaled up to the size of a pea sized marble in the middle of a football stadium, the orbital of the single electron would extend all the way at the outer edge of the stadium, the electron no bigger than a grain of sand; almost all empty space.</p>

<p>Now just imagine a sphere of solid mass of such marbles filling the stadium with no space left. That is how we can picture the density of a neutron star, and it is the density limit of the universe. A black hole has this same density, just more massive.</p>

<p>""A neutron star is so dense that one teaspoon (5 milliliters) of its material would have a mass over 5.5×10<sup>12</sup> kg (that is 1100 tonnes per 1 nanolitre), about 900 times the mass of the Great Pyramid of Giza.""</p>

<p>With the density limit constant, a neutron star can only get larger, occupy a greater volume, as it gains more mass. The mass and surface area determine the escape velocity, the velocity needed for an object to escape the host's gravity from the surface. The immense gravity causes the smallest neutron star to have an escape velocity of 100,000 km/s, or one third of the speed of light.</p>

<p>When the mass of the neutron star surpasses the level at which the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">escape velocity</a> for the neutron star exceeds the speed of light, then even light cannot escape its gravitation, thus becoming a <strong>black hole</strong>.</p>

<p>Note: There is theoretically a point where the gravity and density of a neutron star will reach a threshold called the neutron degeneracy pressure.  This was hypothesized by Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff, and limit by same name.  This would result in greater density called baryonic density.  Then if we go denser, we can get quark density, and so on.  These are all speculative theories since the sub-nuclear interactions are not well understood, and we can't look inside a black hole to see the evidence.</p>

<h1>Sure. Aberration is always the same. Parallax depends on the distance, and the phase is different.</h1>

<p>Why is their phase different? They all have a one year period.</p>

<p>Generally we should not worry about the light aberration, right? Even space telescopes have reference stars. The position of the reference stars are fixed. So although there are detectable wobble(20"") in one year , because we use reference stars, this kind of effect is removed every day immediately. Every night, when the night assistant lets a telescope point at some direction, he has to use reference stars to calibrate that night's pointing. </p>

<p>Am I right? </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>That is a horrible value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That value for aberration of starlight is ""horrible"" in two ways: One, in that's is very small. And two, in that it's large enough to interfere with parallax measurements.</p>

<p>In the late 1600s, scientists had already adopted the heliocentric model, and so were looking to measure the distance to the stars via parallax. Robert Hooke was among the first to attempt it, and probably the first to claim a measurement of the parallax. His observations were not very convincing at that time, but he probably did observe some effects from aberration of starlight (though they didn't know such a thing existed back then).</p>

<p>In the early 1700s, Bradley attempted to make a more precise measurement of parallax, and did obtain significant data, but the variations in the star positions were out of phase with the model. Using the speed of light estimate by Ole Roemer from Hooke's time, he correctly proposed that this was not parallax, but a speed-of-light phenomenon, now known as the aberration of starlight.</p>

<p>More info here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.2061.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.2061.pdf</a></p>

<p>It took another century, until early 1800, for Bessel to measure the first parallax.</p>

<p>Basically, aberration of starlight produces the same variation in the positions of all stars, a periodic elliptic ""wobble"" that is the same for all stellar objects. Parallax produces a similar kind of wobble, but the amplitude depends on the distance to the star, and the phase is different from the aberration's.</p>

<p>There are also other effects, such as nutation, which introduce further perturbations.</p>

<p><a href=""http://cseligman.com/text/history/bradley.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://cseligman.com/text/history/bradley.htm</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Aberration per se is easy to explain via the old analogy to running through the rain. When you're standing, rain falls vertically. When you're running, rain appears to come from a different direction. Same with starlight. Like in this diagram (by Professor Courtney Seligman, linked above):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Yynv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now, small as that value is, it's still 20 arcsec. The resolving power of early telescopes (and modern amateur telescopes) is 1 arcsec or better - which is more than enough. What you need is a very solid mount with good setting circles. Lacking that, you could build a telescope with a fixed position, very rigid, forever pointing at the same place in the sky - that's what Hooke did - and then you're only limited by resolving power.</p>

<p>In any case, the precision required was quite doable with 1700s technology. An amateur could do it today, at very low cost - what you need is persistence to follow through with a long term project.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure. Aberration is always the same. Parallax depends on the distance, and the phase is different.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is their phase different? They all have a one year period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go to the site by Prof. Seligman, link above, and look at the two diagrams showing the aberration and the parallax. In point B (in April), the star is in the middle of the ellipse due to parallax, but it's at the right-hand tip of the ellipse due to aberration.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, parallax is a position-based effect, whereas aberration is a speed-based effect. It makes sense that they are out of phase by 90 degrees (remember trigonometry?)</p>

<hr>

<p>Proper motion appears as a long-term drift of stellar positions that remains even after you subtract aberration, parallax, nutation, etc. There's a back-and-forth-back-and-forth from aberration and parallax, whereas proper motion keeps going in one direction only.</p>

<p>You could measure proper motion with relatively short term observations, but it only works for stars that are nearby and are moving fast. If you're willing to wait decades, proper motion is much more easy to measure.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally we should not worry about the light aberration, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, sort of. You know, at any given moment, the size and the direction of it. So you could simply subtract it from the measured position of the star you're watching.</p>

<p>OTOH, it was an additional source of error, until speed of light and the Earth's orbital parameters were very precisely determined. Perhaps it still contributes to the noise added to the data, to some extent - I'm not entirely sure here.</p>

"How do scientists name space objects?","440","","<p>I am curious that there are lots of celestial objects (planets, comets, stars, galaxies, etc.) in space. How do we name them?</p>
","<p>Millennia ago, when only a few thousand stars, a handful of planets and nebulae, and some transient objects like supernovae and comets, were known, people usually named these objects after gods and heros, but also after everyday objects. Stellar constellations that vaguely resembled something known, was named after this. Mars is red, so it was named after the god of war; Mercury, being the fastest to complete one cycle around the Sun, was named the god of messaging and traveling.</p>

<p>With the advent of telescopes, so many objects are now known that we had to come up with a more pragmatic convention, so usually an object is named according to its place in some catalogue, its type, and/or it coordianates on the sky. For instance, a quasar detected at the ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_%28astronomy%29#Julian_years_and_J2000"">J2000</a>"" coordinates $\{\mathrm{dec.},\mathrm{RA}\} = \{22^\circ\, 22'\, 56'', -09^\mathrm{h}\, 46^\mathrm{m}\, 36^\mathrm{s}\}$ may be called J2222–0946. An x-ray source observed in the constellation Cygnus may be called Cyg X-1, while its binary counterpart is number 226,868 in the Henry Draper Extension Catalogue and is thus named ""HDE 226868"".</p>

<p>Oftentimes, an object appears in multiple catalogues, and will thus have multiple names. For instance, a Lyman $\alpha$-emitting galaxy appears in a catalogue of Ly$\alpha$ emitters, but due to its infrared properties, it will also appear in some catalogue over dusty galaxies (though Ly$\alpha$ emitters tend to contain little dust).</p>

"Orbiting supermassive black hole or galactic center of mass?","430","","<p>One of the ways they measure the (supposed?) supermassive black hole at the galactic center of the milky way is to measure those tens of stars right at the galactic center that are orbiting what appears to be nothing, but what is said to be a supermassive black hole.</p>

<p>My question is why there is a distinction between all other stars in the galaxy orbiting (for instance, our own sun) and those few right near the galactic center orbiting.  My point is, if you ask what our solar system orbits, an astronomer wouldn't say ""the supermassive black hole at the center,"" he would say ""the galactic center of mass.""  My assumption is that you couldn't even calculate the mass of the supermassive black hole by knowing our sun's mass and orbit - people would probably say we are too far out, or we are orbiting the galactic center of mass rather than the black hole, yadda yadda.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>1) Why the distinction?  How do we know that the stars right at the galactic center aren't also orbiting the galactic center of mass vs. the supermassive black hole?</p>

<p>2) What would happen if you magically removed the supermassive black hole in an instant?  Would the stars right at the center continue to orbit the center?  If so, how is that different than what they were originally doing?</p>

<p>Note that I know that center of mass of the galaxy and the supermassive black hole are two different things.  I also know that the center of mass of the galaxy is either superimposed on the supermassive black hole, or quite close to it.  I just want to know how or why some objects feel the center of mass of the galaxy and respond to it, while others feel the pull of the supermassive black hole and respond to it.  How far away do you have to be to be considered ""orbiting the center of mass"" rather than ""orbiting the supermassive black hole?""</p>
","<p>1) It is the mass internal to the orbit that determines the orbital speeds. These stars are so close to the center that the amount of bulge star mass contained within the orbit would be insignificant compared to the BH.
2) If the BH disappeared these stars would go into highly radial orbits out to much greater distances.  That distance would be about where the mass of the bulge/nucleus stars and gas equals the mass of the BH. </p>

"Hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets orbiting the Sun","429","","<p>The planet HD 106906 b was found at 650 AU from its home star, a star not so different from the Sun. Fomalhaut b is also a young planet that is orbiting very far away from its star.</p>

<p>These two planets were discovered mainly because they are young enough to still be hot enough to be seen in the infrared. I think that old planets in very high orbits would have temperatures below 10K, and thus be black and invisible.</p>

<p>Some people agree with the hypothesis that, in our Solar System, somewhere out beyond Neptune, some non-dwarf planets might be orbiting the Sun. The existence of HD 106906 b and Fomalhaut b suggests that this is possible. What are the odds that we could find at least one of these planets in our Solar System?

This is, of course, in part because any mention of such a discovery will cause a stir, but it is also in part because of the claimed probability if the movements of the Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) being purely by chance: 0.007%, or 1 in 14,000, which corresponds to a probability of ~ 3.8<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">$\sigma$</a>.</p>

<p>That said, the actual probability that this planet exists is a bit lower - 90%, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/01/20/new-evidence-suggests-a-ninth-planet-lurking-at-the-edge-of-the-solar-system/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to Brown</a>, and 68.3%, <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/discovering-planet-nine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to Greg Laughlin</a>, an astronomy at UC-Santa Cruz who knew of the results prior to the paper's publication.

<li>Transit.</li>
<li>Gravitational microlensing</li>
<li>Direct imaging.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prior surveys either don't look enough in-depth, in-depth but in other areas of the sky, or cover wavelengths in which this planet doesn't show up in.<sup><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/13335/2153"">[4]</a></sup> This is another problem with the use of WISE detailed in <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/1183/2153"">MBR's answer here</a>. Others problems are that planet is probably not massive enough for WISE to see it, and is extremely far away. It may also be cold and have a low albedo, making direct detection hard.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I bring all this up because, surprisingly, the case of Planet Nine is very relevant to the detection of these other planets that you mentioned in your question.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_106906_b"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HD 106906 b</a></strong></p>

<p>There are several similarities here between this planet and Planet Nine.</p>

<ul>
<li>HD 106906 b has an orbit with a semi-major axis of at least 650 AU. By comparison, Planet Nine is thought to have a semi-major axis of about 700 AU, according to the estimates in the paper. That said, other orbital properties are unknown for HD 106906 b and may differ.</li>
<li>HD 106906 b has a mass of about 11 Earth masses; Planet Nine has a mass of about 10 Earth masses.</li>
</ul>

<p>One difference is that HD 106906 b may have formed where it is at the moment. Scattering, like Planet Nine experienced, appears to be unlikely. This means that the two could have different compositions - although I would think that both might be ice giants or the remains thereof, given where they formed.</p>

<p>In short, HD 106906 b may be very similar to Planet Nine, and while we do not know much about either property, it seems safe to say that detection methods and problems would be similar.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomalhaut_b"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fomalhaut b</a></strong></p>

<p>Fomalhaut b is a bit different. Its semi-major axis is ~177 AU - much smaller than these other two planets - and may be anywhere from 10 Earth masses to several hundred Earth masses.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Fomalhaut b was also indirectly detected, just like Planet Nine. A gap was found in Fomalhaut's dust disk, which could only have been caused by a massive planet. Later, it was directly imaged.</p>

<p>Direct detection <em>might</em> be possible if Fomalhaut b was in the Solar System, especially given its greater size and mass. Additionally, it would have an enormous impact on TNOs. However, it would be a gas giant, not an ice giant, so it would be difficult to explain how it moved out so far.</p>

<hr>

<p>I discussed those planets to take a slight detour and talk about what might (and might not) be beyond Neptune. I'll be more explicit here.</p>

<p><strong>What could be beyond Neptune</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>An ice giant, like Planet Nine, or the remains of one. This would have been formed closer in, near Jupiter and Saturn, which existed in a period resonance with Saturn. Other giant planet resonances would have also existed. Then a instability broke the resonances, bringing the ice giant inwards towards Saturn and then Jupiter, where it was flung outwards. This changed the orbits of the other four gas giants. I talked about this is <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/13311/2153"">another answer of mine</a>, which I seem to be continuously referencing.</p>

<p>That said, the initial answer was incorrect, which I have since noted, and was revised. Batygin's estimates found that Planet Nine would have been ejected many, many, millions of years before the resonances were supposedly broken (according to evidence from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Late Heavy Bombardment</a>). However, this does not mean that there could not have been a sixth giant. The simulations <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.2957v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nesvorný  &amp; Morbidelli (2012)</a> that explored the evolution of a Solar System with four, five, and six giant planets found some good results with five and six giant planets.</p></li>
<li>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Earth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">super-Earth</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Neptune"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mini-Neptune</a>.<sup>1</sup> These are planets that are, at the most, 10 Earth masses. Super-Earths would be terrestrial planets with thick atmospheres; mini-Neptunes would be gas planets. Note that these names do not say anything else about their compositions - for example, super-Earths are not necessarily habitable.</li>
<li>Something else. The region has not yet been explored well, and there could be some other unforeseen objects. This kind of object would likely be cold, as WISE (see next section) might have detected it otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What cannot be beyond Neptune</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>A gas giant.<sup>2</sup> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-field_Infrared_Survey_Explorer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer</a> found <a href=""http://www.space.com/24989-planet-x-search-nasa-telescope.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">no Saturn-mass objects up to 10,000 AU, and no Jupiter-mass objects up to 26,000 AU</a>.</p>

<p>This is, of course, besides <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1633/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">many other planets that cannot exist</a>. Anyway, this is we would most likely have detected Fomalhaut b by now, if it was in the Solar System.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>So, assuming that there <em>is</em> something beyond Neptune, how can we fine it? Well, now that its existence has been hypothesized and we know where it <em>should</em> be, astronomers can turn telescopes towards that location and use direct imaging.</p>

<p>There's been some excitement because <a href=""http://www.naoj.org/Topics/2016/01/21/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Subaru Telescope will be used</a>.

","<p>The easiest method of photometry is by comparing the measured instrumental intensity of the unknown target with one or more other known targets in the same field and then converting the difference into magnitudes.  This is called differential photometry, and is easier because you don't have to worry about things like atmospheric extinction.  The more comparison stars you use, the better your result.  There are tools that will automatically do this analysis and calculate your error bars.  I use MaximDL.</p>

"What are Flamsteed numbers?","429","","<p>Can you tell me about Flamsteed numbers? I just know that it is a specific number used for identification of stars. But what is the theory behind it? In what way is the number given to stars?</p>
","<p>Flamsteed designations are assigned by John Flamsteed. He was an English Astronomer.</p>

<p>Flamsteed Designations (Flamsteed Numbers) are numbers assigned to the stars for the purpose of identification and cataloguing.
Flamsteed designation contained 2554 stars.</p>

<p>Flamsteed designations for stars are similar to Bayer designations, except that they use numbers instead of Greek letters.</p>

<p>[ Bayer designation is a stellar designation in which a specific star is identified by a Greek letter, followed by the genitive form of its parent constellation's Latin name. The original list contained 1,564 stars.
For the most part, Bayer assigned Greek and Latin letters to stars in rough order of apparent brightness, from brightest to dimmest, within a particular constellation. Since in a majority of constellations the brightest star is designated Alpha (α), followed by beta for the 2nd brightest and so on.
But this was not the rule always followed by Bayer.
Somtimes by position of a particular star in that constellation, sometimes the order of rising up in the sky (the star rises up early will get earlier number), sometimes he follows mythological stories or data or sometimes he even uses his own way of assigning the number.]</p>

<p>In Flamsteed designations, Each star is assigned a number and the Latin genitive of the constellation it lies in.
e.g. 52 Cancri is star in the Constellation Cancer and assigned a number 52 according to star's right ascension. i.e. there are 51 stars in the Cancer constellation to the West direction of 52 Cancri star or there are 51 stars that rise before/earlier of 52 Cancri star.</p>

<p>The numbers were originally assigned in order of increasing right ascension within each constellation. 
[Right ascension is the angular distance measured eastward along the celestial equator from the vernal equinox (it is one of the point of intersection in the space of two imaginary circles: Celestial Equator and Earth's orbit around the Sun. Our Earth is at this point on 21/22 March each year while orbiting around sun.) to the the position of the star. It is measured in degrees  but for simplicity and ease of use, mentioned in the form of hours. That the 360 circle is divided into 24 hours (1 hour = 15 degrees). ]</p>

<p>But due to the effects of precession (Top like rotation of Earth's axis of rotatation in the space mataining a constant angle of 23.5 degrees with verticle) they are now slightly out of order in some places.</p>

<p>Flamsteed catalogue don't cover all the stars visible from Earth with naked eye. Flamsteed's catalogue covered only the stars visible from Great Britain, and therefore stars of the far southern constellations have no Flamsteed numbers.</p>

"""Chain reaction"" supernovae?","428","","<p>I know not all stars can ""go nova"", and that of those that do there are different types of novae, among which are some that aren't even explosions (at least not as we think of them), and that even the ones that <em>are</em> explosions are really not like what we do with TNT or C4 anyway.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I can't shake the comparison from my head, and that got me thinking: Are there any circumstances under which one star going nova can trigger novae in other nearby stars, creating a chain reaction?</p>
","<p>Be careful when saying ""nearby stars"". The scales involved in ""nearby"" are beyond what most people imagine. If our Sun was the size of a soccer ball located in California, the nearest star would be another soccer ball located in Greenland.</p>

<p>Let's say the average distance between ""nearby"" stars is a few light years. Let's say an average supernova is like the recent one in the M82 galaxy. That supernova, at, say, 10 light years, would be less bright and less hot than the Sun as seen from Earth. To make that supernova appear as bright and as hot as the mid-day Sun, you'd have to be at 1/3 light years from it (the supernova would have to be in the middle of the Oort cloud).</p>

<p>Interstellar distances are stupendous. Even a supernova cannot do much to compensate for distance.</p>

<p>But what if the stars are very close to each other? They would pretty much have to orbit each other, forming a double star. Moreover, both would have to be on the verge of going supernova. That's a pretty unlikely situation.</p>

<p>Even then, there are many kinds of supernova. There's type Ia, where a dwarf orbiting a red giant leeches too much material from the giant and eventually explodes:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/16ZQZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Then there's the core collapse supernova, where a star is simply too bloated and too old to sustain enough pressure in the core; the core collapses into itself due to gravity and re-ignites fusion, effectively exploding like a bomb and ejecting the outer layers:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e2etE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is a nearby stellar explosion going to increase instability in its about-to-blow-up companion, or is it going to reduce its chances of exploding? The answer is not trivial.</p>

<p>Bottom line: I wouldn't say it's mathematically impossible, but it's a combination of quite unlikely scenarios. In a ""normal"" galactic neighborhood like ours, it's never going to happen.</p>

"Why does the Chandrasekhar limit affect white dwarfs differently?","427","","<p>The Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star. Beyond this, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf will typically explode in a type 1a supernova, due to the nuclear reactions at those temperatures.</p>

<p>Why is this? Can anyone walk me through, step by step, what happens if a white dwarf (of both compositions) exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, and how each differs?</p>

<hr>

<p>Source: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9701225"">https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9701225</a></p>
","<p>Whether a white dwarf responds to the accretion of material by exploding or collapsing depends on the competition between energy being released in fusion reactions and energy being locked away by endothermic electron capture (neutronisation) reactions.</p>

<p>It is thought that most white dwarfs of moderate mass have a C/O composition. They will need to accrete a lot of mass to get to a density (at about $4\times 10^{13}$ kg/m$^3$, reached at $1.38M_{\odot}$ in a non-rotating WD) where neutronisation becomes energetically feasible. It is possible, that before this happens, that fusion reactions are ignited (due to high density, rather than temperature). The threshold density for ignition is lower for nuclei with lower atomic number (He &lt; C &lt; O) and the ignition threshold densities for He and C are probably lower than the neutronisation threshold for C.</p>

<p>In a C/O WD that has accreted a lot of matter, ignition could take place in C at the core, or it could be triggered in He (at even lower densities) at the base of a deep accreted shell of material. The electron degenerate matter has a pressure that is independent of temperature, leading to runaway fusion and the complete destruction of the star.</p>

<p>O/Ne/Mg WDs are made as the final stages of more massive stars ($8-10M_{\odot}$) and are born as remnants with much higher mass $&gt;1.2M_{\odot}$ than typical C/O WDs. More massive WDs are smaller, with higher density. The neutronisation thresholds for O, Ne, Mg are only $1.9\times10^{13}$, $6\times 10^{12}$ and $3\times 10^{12}$ kg/m$^3$ respectively (all lower than for C). This means that a O/Ne/Mg WD may have to accrete very little mass to reach this central density, begin neutronisation, which leads to collapse. In addition if such densities are insufficient to trigger C burning in a C/O WD, then they certainly won't be high enough to trigger burning in O/Ne/Mg because of stronger coulomb repulsion. Further, if little mass is accreted, then there won't be a deep envelope of accreted material in which to ignite burning off-centre.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, O/Ne/Mg WDs may be more likely to collapse than explode (the collapse would cause a type of core-collapse supernova though).</p>

"Understanding ""dex""","426","","<p>Hi I am trying to understand the concept of dex and how to use it in calculations. The usual definition is that it is the order of magnitude, so $10^{0.1}$ is $0.1$ dex. </p>

<p>I want to do a simple exercise of calculating the value of the RHS of Eqn 4 in this paper <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2102"" rel=""nofollow"">arxiv paper</a>, the gammas are incomplete gamma functions and the value of $\alpha$, $\phi_∗$ and $M_∗$ are given in table 2. The units of $\phi_∗$ is $h_{70}^3$ Mpc$^{−3}$ dex$^{−1}$. The value of the integral is given in the following paragraph as $5.06×10^5 h_{70}^3$ $M_⊙$ Mpc$^{−3}$ (let's take only the first one). If I substitute the values from table 2 to the RHS of Eq 4 and then calculate I get $7.58 × 10^5$ $h_{70}^3$ Mpc$^{−3}$ dex$^{−1}$ . What do I do with the dex$^{-1}$? Is it because of the dex$^{-1}$ I am a little off? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Does the $d(\log(M_{bh}))$ in the integral take care of the $\rm{dex}^{-1}$, and my little off answer is due to rounding errors?</p>
","<p>The ""Schechter-like"" Equation 3 in that paper is meant to give the value of black-hole mass density in units of ""number of black holes of a particular mass per volume per log black hole mass"", with the volume in units of megaparsecs and the ""log black hole mass"" in units of 0.1 log solar-mass units -- i.e., 0.1 dex.</p>

<p>Since the integral involves multiplying by $d \log M_{\rm BH}$, you are multiplying $(\log M_{\rm BH})^{-1}$ by $\log M_{\rm BH}$, and thus the ""dex"" units do indeed cancel out.</p>

<p>As for the exact value, you're going to have trouble reproducing that. First of all, the value from the text that you quoted (""5.06"") is the result when they integrate over <em>all</em> BH masses, not just the $10^6$ to $10^{10}$ limits in Equation 4. From their Table 3, the relevant comparison value would be 4.9 if you're just doing the integration in Equation 4.</p>

<p>Second, the values they quote in Table 3 (and in the text for the full integration) are apparently not straightforward computations from their Equation 4 (or from the full integral). They go through a complicated exercise of computing this value 10001 times, each time tweaking the input coefficients of Equation <em>1</em>, then applying some more using random Gaussian deviations, so they end up with a distribution of BH density values, not just a single one. They say</p>

  <p>The final SMBH density is defined as the median of this distribution
  with the 1σ error given by 68 percentile range</p>

"Claim that 30-m class telescopes will have resolution far superior to Hubble: true?","423","","<p><a href=""http://www.space.com/14075-10-biggest-telescopes-earth-comparison.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> makes the claim that the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT, number 4 in the list) will have resolution 10 times better than that of Hubble, while the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT, number 3 in the list) will have resolution 12 times better than that of Hubble.  These are claims I find impossible to believe.  </p>

<p>A simple application of, for instance, the Raleigh Criterion ($\theta = 1.22~\lambda/D$), where $\theta$ is the angular resolution of the telescope, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light in question, and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope, would show that a comparison between angular resolutions is as simple as comparing the diameters of the telescope apertures.  Hubble's mirror is 2.4 m; comparing with the 24.5 m GMT and the 30 m TMT we see that the GMT will have 10.2 times the angular resolution of Hubble, while the TMT will have 12.5 times the angular resolution of Hubble.  I think a calculation similar to the one I have described is how the article linked above came up with the numbers they did about the angular resolution of these telescopes compared to Hubble. </p>

<p>However, the Raleigh criterion only applies to telescopes working at their diffraction limit.  Space telescopes (if they're designed well and built correctly) can work close to the diffraction limit (maybe even at the diffraction limit).  Ground-based telescopes, however, are limited in angular resolution by the atmosphere, which at best will limit resolution to about an arc-second at the best sites on Earth. Thus the GMT and TMT by themselves will <strong>not</strong> have better image resolution than Hubble.</p>

<p><strong>My question, then, is whether this article is correct (possibly because of one of the reasons I list below) or whether it seems this article naively applied the Raleigh Criterion for angular resolution with no thought about how the atmosphere will affect the resolving capabilities of these large ground-based telescopes.</strong></p>

<p>Possible reasons the article may still be correct:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adaptive optics, a developing technology which can allow telescopes to correct for distortions to the image produced by the atmosphere.  Perhaps GMT and TMT will have very fancy adaptive optics systems.</li>
<li>Another technique, such as speckle imaging or lucky imaging.</li>
<li>Article could be referring to <em>spectral</em> resolution, rather than <em>angular</em> resolution (or image resolution).  However, obtaining good spectral resolution is as much the job of the spectral instrument as it is of the telescope so I don't consider ""spectral resolution"" to be an inherent property of a telescope.</li>
</ul>
","<p>Adaptive optics, as it says on the <a href=""http://www.gmto.org/overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">GMT website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most sophisticated engineering aspects of the telescope is
  what is known as “adaptive optics.” The telescope’s secondary mirrors
  are actually flexible. Under each secondary mirror surface, there are
  hundreds of actuators that will constantly adjust the mirrors to
  counteract atmospheric turbulence. These actuators, controlled by
  advanced computers, will transform twinkling stars into clear steady
  points of light. It is in this way that the GMT will offer images that
  are 10 times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and on the <a href=""http://www.tmt.org/science-case"" rel=""nofollow"">TMT web</a> site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to providing nine times the collecting area of the current
  largest optical/infrared telescopes (the 10-meter Keck Telescopes),
  TMT will be used with adaptive optics systems to allow
  diffraction-limited performance, i.e., the best that the optics of the
  system can theoretically provide. This will provide unparalleled
  high-sensitivity spatial resolution more than 12 times sharper than
  what is achieved by the Hubble Space Telescope. For many applications,
  diffraction-limited observations give gains in sensitivity that scale
  like the diameter of the mirror to the fourth power, so this increase
  in size has major implications.</p>

"Supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies","423","","<p>The fact is, many, if not most large galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their center. My question is why? Is it because when these galaxies were first formed supermassive black holes were created out of super-dense clouds of matter, which then attracted the rest of the galaxy? Or is the black hole attracted to the center of the galaxy in such a way that due to its large mass and ability to perturb everything around it, the interactions with the galaxy tend to move the center to where the black hole is located?</p>

<p>It seems interesting that Sagittarius A* is at the precise center of the galaxy, when it has so much less mass than the rest of the galaxy put together. The sun being at the center of the solar system makes a lot of sense - it accounts for 99.8% of the mass of the solar system. But the mass of Sagittarius A* is on the order of one millionth the mass of the galaxy.</p>

"What is meant by ""Radial Direction"" of a galaxy?","422","","<p>There is a scientific journal article having a line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""In order to study the star formation scenario in the radial direction
  of the LMC....""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is meant by 'radial direction' of a galaxy ?</p>
","<p>'Radial direction' typically means from the center, moving outwards. Typically, these kinds of studies will break a galaxy up into several annuli, or rings, and examine the star formation activity within each ring. (Imagine drawing a series of concentric circles, each one a little bigger than the last.) Then, if the star formation rate or star formation history changes as a function of radius, those changes can be more easily quantified.</p>

<p>It is often difficult to do this well because galaxies are not perfectly symmetric. The LMC, for instance, is a dwarf irregular galaxy, meaning its structure is not nearly as orderly as some other galaxies (e.g. The Milky Way, which is a spiral). The LMC does contain more stars near its center, and it even has a bar, but it is difficult to discern much more structure than that. To define the center of such a galaxy, the total light profile is measured and the centroid calculated.</p>

<p>Since we are rarely fortunate enough to be looking at another galaxy perfectly face-on, we also have to consider the effects of inclination on our observations. (If you were to hold up a plate and angle it a little bit, it would begin to look like an oval, but that doesn't mean it isn't still actually round.) If they have taken inclination into account, they should reference the ""deprojected radius."" That means that they know that the inclination to our line of sight makes some parts of the galaxy look closer to the center than they actually are, and they corrected for that effect.</p>

<p>I've heard (but should provide a source) it said that Mars core has solidified.  I remember NdGT saying that, but if he says it on a show, it's really the show saying, not him.   Anyway, I'll try to get that point worked out.  </p>

<p>But, these seemingly conflicting statements might still have some relation (I think).  A basic explanation is that the difference between liquid and solid under the pressures you get inside a planet are somewhat inexact.   The other thing is, to generate a magnetic field, you need more than just a liquid metal around a solid metal, but you need dynamic spiraling.  See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/dynamo_effect.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. </p>

<p>Venus rotates very slowly, this rotation means that Venus has essentially zero Coriolis effect, which might help it generate a permanent magnetic field.   Earth's relatively rapid rotation and Coriolis effect, and perhaps it's very gradually slowing rotation due to the Moon, help Earth maintain it's magnetic field.  A very slow variation in the rate of rotation of the solid core and outer solid mantle could generate enough spin to maintain the magnetic field.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://www.physics.org/article-questions.asp?id=64"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> on the Coriolis force and <a href=""https://astronomynow.com/2016/04/01/moon-thought-to-play-major-role-in-maintaining-earths-magnetic-field/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> on the moon's possible role on maintaining the Earth's magnetic field.</p>

<p>The point of all this, planetary magnetic fields are complicated but they likely require the right type of permanent flow within the liquid part of the core, probably around a solid iron core.  Earth maintains that perhaps in part due to higher core temperatures which enable more easy flowing as well as the release of heat through condensation as the outer core solidifies onto the inner core and perhaps also, due to the Moon.    Mars at one time in it's past probably had a magnetic field similar to or perhaps even stronger than Earth, evidenced by some powerful crustal fields that remain.  See <a href=""http://www.space.dtu.dk/english/Research/Universe_and_Solar_System/magnetic_field"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  </p>

<p>I don't know why he uses the word ""solidified"" when other research says liquid.   That might be a good question to ask him, but, Neil deGrass Tyson may be right that the cooling of the smaller Mars may have caused it to lose it's magnetic field, but based on article's I've read, he's incorrect to imply it solidified, but the liquid core may have become solid enough that the dynamics that could have once caused a magnetic field could have stopped, at least, I would speculate that this is possible but I don't think anyone knows for 100% certain.  The history of planetary magnetic fields as well as the precise makeup of planetary cores and what turns on or off a magnetic field inside a planet isn't well understood.</p>

<p>and Zepher's answer is also important that the temperature of a liquid iron core at pressures inside of a planet are very different than the melting temperature at 1 ATM.   Earth's inner core is hotter than it's outer core but the greater pressure keeps it's inner core solid while it's outer core is liquid.  </p>

","<p>Aganju's answer is excellent, but I'd like to add one thing: The radius used is Earth's radius, which is applicable if you're at the equator. At higher latitudes, the effective radius is smaller by a factor $\cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the latitude in radians.</p>

<p>For iMerchant, who seem to be located in Vancouver at

the relevant radius is
$$
R_\mathrm{eff} = R_\oplus\cos\theta = 4150\,\mathrm{km},
$$
so at the $T=1.4\,\mathrm{h}$ of Aganju's answer (1.5 h is just a little too slow), the centrifugal (or <a href=""https://xkcd.com/123/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">-petal</a>, if you prefer) acceleration would be only $g_\mathrm{spin} = 6.5\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.</p>

<p>Moreover, whereas Earth's acceleration is directed toward the center of Earth, in Vancouver the centrifugal acceleration would be directed at an angle $\theta$ toward South. Thus, only a component $g_\mathrm{spin} \cos\theta = 4.2\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ would point upward.</p>

<p>This is not enough to send iMerchant into space. However, a component $g_\mathrm{spin} \sin\theta = 4.9\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, or roughly half a G, would point horizontally toward South, enough to send him tumbling down the street, or at least walk awkwardly.</p>

I'm assuming when you say acceleration, you're referring to the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/science/space/05nobel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">accelerating expansion of the universe</a> so you're not looking at the particular acceleration of an object (which you could get from examining the force of gravity imparted on that object). </p>

<p>So in addition to a redshift, you need to find a way to independently measure the distance. To get out to an appreciable redshift (z~0.5), Type Ia supernova <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder#Type_Ia_light_curves"" rel=""nofollow"">are used</a> as ""standard candles"". They are considered standard because they're believed to be from white dwarfs that explode because they have reached their maximum possible mass, the Chandrasekhar limit, of 1.4 solar masses. Therefore, when they explode, they should all look about the same and any difference in brightness would be from how far they are away from us. So they measured the distance and the redshift of the galaxy the supernova originated from to determine the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating over time.</p>

"How far into the future can we go by traveling close to a black hole?","420","","<p>If we sent someone on a path that passed as near as possible to a black hole without getting pulled in, how far into the future would they go due to time dilation?  Let's assume the black hole is 5 solar masses (I am assuming the mass will affect the calculation).  I would like to know from two considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An observer that can survive anything (e.g. ideal case)</p></li>
<li><p>The forces that a human can tolerate (e.g. a human would not be able to get as close to a black hole as would be ideal) </p></li>
</ul>
","<p>The way that you have specified the question, the answer is as far as you like. You simply put your spaceship into any orbit around the black hole and wait.</p>

<p>A more sensible question is what is the largest time dilation factor that can be accomplished - i.e. that maximises your travel time into the future for a given amount of proper time experienced on the spaceship. </p>

<p>This in turn is governed by how close to the black hole you can come and still tolerate the tidal forces. If you don't put a limit on this (your first case), then the answer is again infinite; you can hover as close to the event horizon as you like, using an enormous amount of rocket fuel, and the time dilation (see below) can be arbitrarily large.</p>

<p>Your second case is more realistic. Roughly we can say that the tidal acceleration across a body of length $l$ is given by $GMl/4r^3$, where $M$ is the black hole mass and $r$ is the distance from the black hole. If we make this acceleration equal to say $1 g$, and your body length $l \sim 1$m, then for a $5M_{\odot}$ black hole $r \simeq 2500$ km (well outside the Schwarzschild radius of 15 km).</p>

<p>If you could ""hover"" at this radius, then the time dilation factor would be
$$\frac{\tau}{\tau_0} = \left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{1/2},$$
where $\tau$ is the time interval on a clock on the spaceship and $\tau_0$ is the time interval well away from the black hole.</p>

<p>For $M=5M_{\odot}$ and $r = 2500$ km, this factor is 0.9970.</p>

<p>If the spaceship is in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation#Circular_orbits"" rel=""nofollow"">circular orbit</a>, the factor is $(1 - 3GM/rc^2)^{1/2} = 0.9955$.</p>

"Contradiction between Theory of Relativity and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation?","417","","<p>Newton's Law of Universal Gravity states that an object will accelerate constantly as it falls. Let's assume an object falling into a black hole. According to Newton's Law, when it reaches the event horizon it must be traveling at <code>c</code>, because c is the escape velocity at the event horizon. Therefore, after it passes the event horizon, it must continue to accelerate past <code>c</code>, yet theory of relativity states that it's never gonna happen. <strong>So, in this condition, what will the object do?</strong></p>
","<p><strong>A) Don't take Newton's law too seriously in the relativistic regime.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Newton's Law, when it reaches the event horizon it must be traveling at $c$, because $c$ is the escape velocity at the event horizon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, assuming the particle freefalls from rest at infinity, but the details are quite different from Newtonian theory. For orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_potential"" rel=""nofollow"">effective potential</a> is
$$V = -\frac{GM}{r} + \frac{l^2}{2r^2} - \frac{GMl^2}{c^2r^3}\text{,}$$
where $l\equiv L/m$ is the specific angular momentum of the orbit. The last term offers relativistic corrections that have no analogue in Newtonian gravity, so in general Newton's law cannot be counted on when near the horizon of the black hole.</p>

<p>But for radial freefall, $l = 0$, and we a total orbital specific energy:
$$\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\right)^2 - \frac{GM}{r}\text{,}$$
which has exactly Newtonian form. In particular, a particle freefalling from rest at infinity will have
$$\left|\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\right| = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}\text{,}$$
so at as it nears the horizon ($r\to 2GM/c^2$), we have $|\mathrm{d}r/\mathrm{d}\tau|\to c$, just as Newtonian theory would predict.</p>

<p>However, the motion is only roughly analogous to what's prescribed by Newton's law, because there are very important differences in the interpretation of those quantities. Specifically, (1) the $\tau$ refers to the proper time of the orbiting particle, not coordinate time $t$, and certainly not any absolute time as Newtonian theory proper, and (2) the $r$ refers to the Schwarzschild radial coordinate, which is defined such that a sphere at this coordinate have surface area $4\pi r^2$, and this is <strong>not</strong> the radial distance to the center.</p>

<p><strong>B) Coordinates have no intrinsic meaning.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, after it passes the event horizon, it must continue to accelerate past $c$, yet theory of relativity states that it's never gonna happen. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suppose I fling a particle along a straight ruler, and that ruler is marked in feet. So if, for example, my particle goes five marked units along the ruler in a nanosecond, that's clearly a problem, because the particle must be superluminal ($c\approx 1\,\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{ns}$).</p>

<p>Now suppose the ruler is not marked in feet, and I don't tell you how it's marked. Is it a problem that the particle goes five units in a nanosecond? Without knowing what the marks are, the statement of this sort of ""coordinate speed"" is not even meaningful. Finally, suppose I tell you how the ruler is marked, but its marks do not actually measure the distance along the ruler. Then is it a problem that it goes through five of those marks in a nanosecond?</p>

<p>The moral is simply this: by themselves, coordinates are simply labels to identify events. One can pick coordinates such that the coordinate speed is arbitrarily large or small, and it doesn't matter, because coordinates are not physical things. The universe does not come with its own coordinates; they're just labels we put on things.</p>

<p>However, what can give coordinates meaning is the <em>metric tensor</em>, which relates coordinates to actual lengths or durations, so that, for example, the Schwarzschild radial coordinate has a set meaning in terms of surface areas. Finally, the Schwarzschild coordinates are pathological near the horizon. They are not defined across the horizon (technically, the Schwarzschild coordinates are actually two entirely different coordinate charts disconnected by the horizon). You can see this in the Schwarzschild metric (units of $G = c = 1$):
$$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)\mathrm{d}t^2 + \left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^{-1}\,\mathrm{d}r^2 + r^2(\mathrm{d}\theta^2+\sin^2\theta\,\mathrm{d}\phi^2)\text{,}$$
where the metric coefficients in the Schwarzschild chart are undefined at the horizon $r = 2M$.</p>

<p><strong>C) ""So, in this condition, what will the object do?""</strong></p>

<p>It will cross the event horizon and meet its end at the singularity.</p>

<p>Here's the same Schwarzschild geometry in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullstrand%E2%80%93Painlev%C3%A9_coordinates"" rel=""nofollow"">Gullstrand-Painlevé coordinates</a>:
$$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\mathrm{d}t^2 + \left(\mathrm{d}r + \sqrt{\frac{2M}{r}}\,\mathrm{d}t\right)^2 + r^2(\mathrm{d}\theta^2+\sin^2\theta\,\mathrm{d}\phi^2)\text{.}$$
In this coordinate chart, space is moving towards the singularity at the estate velocity $\sqrt{2GM/r}$, and the particles are carried along with it. In a related coordinate chart, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lema%C3%AEtre_coordinates"" rel=""nofollow"">Lemaître coordinates</a>, particles freefalling from rest at infinity have zero coordinate speed, with $\mathrm{d}r/\mathrm{d}t = 0$, where here $r$ is the Lemaître radial coordinate. (Edit: corrected example mistakenly attributing this property to the GP chart.)</p>

<p>You can pick any coordinate chart that's well-behaved at the horizon, and any such chart will show it moving across the horizon with no trouble. But the Schwarzschild coordinates do not give such a chart, because they're undefined at the horizon. </p>

"What is this rapidly twinkling red, blue, and white star I saw?","417","","<p>Last night, I was on my balcony at 1AM (PST) and I looked up and saw two stars near the horizon (I'd guess ~30 degrees above the horizon), and they were ""twinkling"" about twice as fast as other stars higher in the sky, and I could clearly see them changing from red to white to blue repeatedly.

"How can gravity lead to the Big Crunch scenario?","416","","<p>According to modern cosmology, space is expanding, causing proper distances (but not comoving distances) to increase between galaxies. In the Big Crunch hypothesis, gravity halts and reverses the expansion of the Universe, causing all matter to collide and eventually form a single black hole. This gives way to other oscillating universe hypotheses, which generally propose that the conditions in a compressed Universe would be the same as those during the Big Bang, leading a cycle of expanding and contracting universes.</p>

<p>Ignoring the <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/13615/are-there-any-studies-that-prove-disprove-the-oscillating-universe-theory/18569#18569"">problems with entropy</a> in reverting the Universe to Big Bang conditions, how can gravity be the cause of a Big Crunch in the first place? Specifically, gravity (to my knowledge) only curves space; the idea that it can revert the Universe to the conditions of the Big Bang seems to imply that gravity actually can contract space. Is this actually the case?</p>

<p>If not, the gravitating objects should be moving through a comoving coordinate system, so space itself would not actually be contracting. As far as I can tell, we would have all the Universe's matter compressed within a single point in space, instead of space itself contracting. This should be completely unlike the Big Bang, when space was far less dilated than it is now. If this is in fact what the Big Crunch hypothesis describes, than I'm utterly confused as to how an oscillating universe could work in such a situation.</p>

<p>Am I mistaken, or do the Big Crunch and oscillating universe hypotheses imply that gravity actually contracts space (as in, the comoving distances of gravitationally attracting objects would not change)? If not, how could gravity possibly lead to these scenarios?</p>
","<p>The amount of matter in the universe is directly related to the curvature of space itself.  We can look at the Friedmann Equations to see how this works:
$$
H(t)^2 = \frac{R'(t)^2}{R(t)^2} = \frac{8\pi G}{3}(\rho_{m} + \rho_{r}) + \frac{1}{3}\Lambda - \frac{c^2}{R^2\mathscr{R}^2}
$$
This is the equation for determining the scale factor for finding distances in the universe at any given time.  Here, $H$ is the Hubble Constant, $R$ is the scale factor, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\rho_m$ is the density of matter (both dark matter and baryonic matter), $\rho_r$ is the density of radiation (photons), $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant due to dark energy, and $\mathscr{R}$ is the radius of curvature of space.</p>

<p>Next, we define a quantity we call the ""critical density"" ($\rho_c$).  This is the density of matter needed to make the universe go from an ""open"", hyperbolic geometry to a ""closed"", spherical geometry.  $\rho_c=\frac{3H^2}{8\pi G}$. We create a value $\Omega=\frac{\rho}{\rho_c}=\frac{8\pi G \rho}{3H^2}$ to take into account this critical density, making our equation:</p>

<p>$$
H^2 = \Omega_m + \Omega_r + \Omega_\Lambda - \frac{c^2}{R^2\mathscr{R}^2}
$$</p>

<p>From here, we input our present-day values for everything.  We define $R$ to be 1 and $H$ to be $H_0$ at the present day.  We also choose to neglect the density of radiation and dark energy.  Simplifying the equation a little gives us:</p>

<p>$$
\frac{c^2}{\mathscr{R}^2} = H_0^2(\Omega_{m,0} - 1)
$$</p>

<p>From here, we can see that the curvature of the universe is dependent on $\Omega_{m,0}$, which is directly related to the density of matter in the universe.  Specifically, for $\Omega_{m,0}\gt1$, $\mathscr{R}$ will be positive, meaning this will be a spherical, closed universe.  If $\Omega_{m,0}\lt1$, $\mathscr{R}$ will be negative, meaning the universe will expand forever, having hyperbolic curvature.  If $\Omega_{m,0}=1$, then $\mathscr{R}=\infty$, which is a flat universe.</p>

<p>So, we can see that having a dense enough universe, gravity will curve space and make it spherical.  You can also use the Friedmann Equation to calculate the deceleration parameter of space - how quickly the expansion is slowing or speeding up:</p>

<p>$$
q_0=\frac{\Omega_{m,0}}{2}
$$</p>

<p>Here, we can see that in a positively curved universe, $q_0&gt;0$, meaning that the universe's expansion will be decelerating.  Eventually, the expansion rate will be negative, and then it will begin collapsing in on itself.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind when thinking about this is that gravity can, in a way, be considered a 'fictitious force'. Gravity is the force objects feel as they attempt to travel in straight lines through curved spacetime.  Matter is what is responsible for the curving of spacetime, so by increasing the density of matter in the universe, you increase the curvature, and thus make objects want to move closer together, which will increase the density, which increases the curvature.  Thus you have a feedback cycle, where you will ultimately collect all matter at a single point, and $\mathscr{R}=0$, so spacetime will have a 0 curvature radius, meaning spacetime has collapsed as well.</p>

When two brown dwarfs collide, if they have <em>enough combined mass</em>, fusion can begin.</p>

<p>This is much different from how normal stars form today, and how they fuse hydrogen and other elements. So my question is this: </p>

<p>Will there be any major differences between the fusion process in the new ""star"" and a star with the same mass that formed via traditional star formation (i.e. collapse of a gas cloud)? Also, how will this affect the new ""star's"" life cycle?</p>
","<p>Your scenario is, of course, rather speculative and considers the very distant future. I don't like that article you're referencing, some stuff seems inaccurate (for example the fraction of baryons locked into stars is tiny and will always remain tiny).</p>

<p>If two brown dwarves collide (extremely unlikely, but if you wait long enough, anything with some tiny non-zero probability eventually will happen), they form a new star with their combined mass. Since the brown dwarves have not undergone any hydrogen burning, the new star has the same composition as a new-born star of the same mass would have had (except for lithium) and, if massive enough, will evolve just like an ordinary M dwarf (or so). In other words, it will fuse hydrogen into helium as all stars on the main sequence.</p>

<p>If the plane of ecliptic of that star happens to be perpendicular to line of sight from Earth to that star - or sufficiently inclined, so that orbits of all its planets as seen from Earth ""circle"" the star without ever transitioning it - does that mean we're completely unable to detect them?</p>
","<p>There are (at least) three main methods to detect planets that orbit so that the orbital plane is at right angles (or thereabouts) to our line of sight.</p>

<p>The first of these is direct imaging. This is already responsible for the discovery of a number of planets. However, in order to be visible against the glare of their host star, the exoplanets need to be in wide orbits and be massive. It also favours the detection of giant planets around <em>young</em> stars, since these planets are still contracting, are still warm, and emitting their own infrared light. A list of about 20 directly imaged exoplanets can be found <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_directly_imaged_exoplanets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>; arguably some of these should more rightly be called brown dwarfs.</p>

<p>A second method is the so-called astrometric detection of exoplanets. This works because the star and planet orbit their common centre of mass. This means that the star executes an orbit with the same period as the exoplanet, but with a semi-major axis that is smaller by the ratio of the planet mass to the star mass. This motion of the star can be detected, in a similar way to which parallax is measured, by precise measurement of position with respect to background objects. The method is most sensitive to wider binaries and massive stars, but is limited by the requirement to see appreciable motion of the star within the duration of the observational dataset. In practice then, this means it is difficult to detect planets with orbital periods of decades, unless one is prepared to wait for some time!</p>

<p>There may only be one accepted exoplanet discovery by this method so far (<a href=""http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_176051_b/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HD 176051b</a>), but the Gaia satellite should be capable of detecting many thousands of exoplanets with masses at or above that of Jupiter and with orbital radii of about 1--10 au (see <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1173"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Perryman et al. 2004</a>).</p>

<p>Thirdly, gravitational microlensing is quite insensitive to the plane of the orbit. This works when a foreground object gravitationally lenses and magnifies the light from a background star. An exoplanet is marked by a ""blip"" in the lensed light curve. There are also about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanets_detected_by_microlensing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">20 planets detected by microlensing</a>. The disadvantage of this technique is that the event is a non-repeatable one-off, so not much more can be learned about these systems.</p>

<p>Notably, all three of these techniques are less sensitive to planets that have small mass (as indeed are transit experiments and the radial velocity technique). However, whilst small planets (in terms of mass) <em>have</em> been found by microlensing, it seems unlikely that the other two techniques will discover Earth-like planets for quite some time.</p>

"On a log-log plot of surface gravity to planet mass, what is the meaning of the y-intercept?","414","","<p>I am playing around with data from exoplanets.org, and am interested in the plot of surface gravity to planet mass. I reproduced this plot <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/lUtlJkh.png"" alt=""this plot""> after downloading their data and performed a non-linear regression model to fit the curve. Unfortunately,the covariance matrix of my fit has infinite values, so I am now trying out a linear fit on a log-log plot, shown below. <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/LPIJF1c.png"" alt=""""> My fit, for $y=ax+b$, is $a=0.9511$, $b=0.8631$. </p>

<p>I am now thinking about what I am plotting. I suspect there may not be anything interesting in $\log \frac{GM}{R^2}$ vs. $\log M$, but, regardless, I am trying to understand if there is any meaning in the y-intercept. </p>

<p>What are possible explanations for the value $b$?</p>
","<p>I think what you have established here is just that $\rho$ tends to increase with mass. The density of planets isn't constant.</p>

<p>Let $\rho = \rho_0 (M/M_{earth})^{\alpha}$, so that $M = (4/3)\pi R^{3} \rho_0 (M/M_{earth})^{\alpha}$ </p>

<p>Then
$$g = \frac{GM}{R^2} = \frac{4\pi G}{3} R \rho$$</p>

<p>Replace $R$ with $(3M/4\pi \rho)^{1/3}$ so that
$$ g = \frac{4\pi G}{3} \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho}\right)^{1/3} \rho$$
$$ g = \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{2/3} G M^{1/3} \rho_0^{2/3} (M/M_{earth})^{2\alpha/3}$$
$$ g = \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{2/3} GM_{earth}^{1/3} \rho_0^{2/3} (M/M_{earth})^{(2\alpha+1)/3}$$</p>

<p>So, bar a (highly possible) algebraic slip, if you plot $\log g$ vs $\log M$, the gradient is $(2\alpha+1)/3$, which from your plot, gives $\alpha \simeq 0.92$ - i.e. the average planet density increases almost linearly with mass.</p>

<p>The intercept then is 
$$ b = \log \left[ \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{2/3} GM_{earth}^{1/3} \rho_0^{2/3}\right],$$
which yields $\rho_0 \simeq 3.5$ kg/m$^3$ (NB: I subtracted 2 from your $b$ to make it SI; giving a density of around 814 kg/m$^3$ at a Jupiter mass).</p>

<p>The fact that density is almost proportional to mass can be found from the same dataset. e.g. see below. Below 0.1 Jupiter masses, the relationship appears to break down, though in actual fact very few of the densities for such planets are very accurately measured (since it requires a radius from a transit), but it works well enough in the range you have plotted. The physics here is that gas giants are governed by a partially (electron) degenerate equation of state that results in them all having a similar radius from about a tenth of a Jupiter mass to about 50 Jupiter masses (albeit with considerable and largely unexplained scatter). Thus the density is proportional to mass. This relationship does not work for small rocky planets, where the radius decreases for smaller masses. Thus your nice line in log space does not continue to lower masses (see plot at bottom - NB: some of the low-mass points have huge uncertainties).</p>

"Create Position-Velocity diagram from a velocity field","412","","<p>Can someone explain to me how I can generate a Position-Velocity (PV) diagram from a galaxy's radial velocity field? I understand that usually PV diagrams are generated across the major axis of the galaxy, but I am not quite sure why they appear as a distribution. For example:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2006/07/aa3210-05/img67.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2006/07/aa3210-05/img67.gif</a></p>
","<p>Such diagrams are usually called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rotation curves</a>, and show the velocity of stars/gas <em>in a disk galaxy viewed edge-on</em> along the line of sight (LOS) as a function of distance from the center.</p>

<p>That is, the $x$ axis gives the distance of the stars from the center ($x=0$) of the galaxy, and the $y$ axis gives the measured velocities at a given distance. Along a given LOS you'll find not a single velocity, but a (Gaussian-like) distribution of velocities, both because there is a certain scatter in velocities, but also because you only measure the component of the velocities projected onto your LOS, while both speed and direction change along the LOS, as seen here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8usas.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8usas.png"" alt=""rotvel""></a></p>

<p><em>If</em> they all had the same velocity along the LOS, the plot you show would be a thin line; instead it is smeared out.</p>

<p>Due to mass being concentrated in the center, there's a steep increase in velocity at low $x$. If there were only the mass you can see, the velocity would decrease at larger $x$ due to the larger distance from the central mass. The reason it stay more or less constant is thought to be the extra, invisible mass known as <em>dark matter</em>.</p>

<p>The reason the left side of the plot is similar to the right, but mirrored not only across the $y$ axis but also the $x$ axis, is that on this side, the stars move <em>toward</em> you, while on the right side they move <em>away</em> from you. The whole galaxy evidently moves away from you at $500\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, since this is the velocity at $x=0$.</p>

<p>So, to recap: How do you generate such a plot? You measure the distribution of velocities along many lines of sight in the galactic plane, from one side ($-R_\mathrm{gal}$) to the other ($+R_\mathrm{gal}$). For instance, at $x=14\,\mathrm{kpc}$, you'd measure $V=675\pm12\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U5JtJ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U5JtJ.png"" alt=""los""></a></p>

<p>In practice, images like this is made by using a grism which disperses the light according to its wavelength, together with a slit placed along the galactic plane, such that you block the light from the rest of the field. This is called <em>slit spectroscopy</em>, in contrast to ""normal"" spectroscopy where you block all light except for a little hole placed on some object (e.g. a star), or integral field spectroscopy, where you get the whole spectrum behind every pixel in an image.</p>

"How rare are earth-like solar eclipses?","412","","<p>Solar eclipses on the earth are so spectacular because the moon has roughly the same size as the sun when viewed from the earth's surface. This is an incredible coincidence, and my guess is that it is a very uncommon phenomenon in the universe.</p>

<p>Is it possible to say anything sensible about the likelihood of a planet having a moon and a sun with same apparent size? Is it possible to make an educated guess about how many places in the universe you would be able to see an earth-like solar eclipse?</p>
","<p>We can certainly <em>speculate</em>.</p>

<p>There are dozens of moons in our own Solar System. I've done some preliminary calculations of their apparent size as seen from the planet vs. the apparent size of the Sun at that distance. The large moons (Jupiter's 4 Galilean satellites, Saturn's Titan, Neptune's Triton) are all substantially larger in the sky than the Sun is. I <em>think</em> there are some satellites that are fairly close to the apparent size of the Sun, but I haven't done all the calculations.</p>

<p>The apparent size of our Moon has changed over time, as the Moon has gradually moved farther away. We are coincidentally in a period of history in which it happens to be very nearly the same apparent size as the Sun.</p>

<p>The criterion for an exoplanet to have solar eclipses like the spectacular ones we have here on Earth is a moon that happens to have an angular size large enough to cover the photosphere, but not so large that it also hides the corona.  For a larger moon, you'd have eclipses in which the corona is visible, but not all the way around the moon. For a smaller moon, you'd only have annular eclipses.  (It could also get interesting if you consider eclipses as seen from other moons.)</p>

<p>So given the distribution of sizes and distances of moons in our Solar System, we can <em>guess</em> that situations where the apparent size of a moon and sun closely match is fairly rare, but since there are moons whose apparent size is smaller than the Sun <em>and</em> others whose apparent size is larger than the Sun, it probably happens sometimes.</p>

<p>The one piece of the puzzle that we're still missing, I think, is the typical sizes and distances of satellites of Earth-like planets. Moons the size of ours orbiting habitable planets might be common or very rare. If they're rare (say, if Mars-like moon systems are far more common), then Earth/Moon style eclipses might be very rare <em>for habitable planets</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> look through a camera, telescope or binoculars with ANY eclipse shades on!</p>

<p>I can see how the enlarged image of the Sun through a telescope or binoculars might overwhelm the eclipse glasses' filters.</p>

<p>But how would looking at the Sun using a camera's viewfinder or LCD screen reduce the effectiveness of eclipse glasses (assuming you're not using any zoom function)?</p>
","<p>Electronic viewfinders (such as the ones using LCD or OLED screens) are excluded from this discussion. There's no danger of eye injury there, except perhaps danger of damaging the camera's sensor if exposure is very long and the lens aperture is big.</p>

<p>It's the classic or optical viewfinders that are targeted by the warning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can see how the enlarged image of the Sun through a telescope or binoculars might overwhelm the eclipse glasses' filters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few observations.</p>

<p>It's really the larger aperture of the instrument that is the problem here. The pupil of your eye is only a few mm in diameter. The objective lens or mirror of a telescope could be anywhere between dozens of mm to hundreds of mm (or thousands for very large instruments). The ratio of areas between telescope aperture and eye pupil is even greater - it's the square of the ratio of diameters.</p>

<p>Let's say your eye's pupil is 2 mm in diameter. Let's say you use a 50 mm aperture telescope (small refractor or binoculars). The diameter ratio is 25x. The area ratio is 625x.</p>

<p>All the light captured by the very large area of the instrument is funneled into your eye through your pupil. With the instrument, now you're getting 625x more energy from the Sun, compared to the naked eye view. It's already dangerous to look at the Sun with the naked eye - with the instrument it's 625x more dangerous. And this is with a very small refractor.</p>

<p>There is a class of ""solar filters"" that are made to be mounted on the instrument's eyepiece, or after the eyepiece. THESE ARE VERY DANGEROUS! All the increased, focused energy of the Sun is now absorbed by the filter, which can warp, melt, crack, or burst into flames. A filter failure at this point is likely to injure the user. White light filtering for solar observations must always occur ahead of the instrument, not after it.</p>

<hr>

<p>As for why classic, optical viewfinders were included in that list: it was out of an abundance of caution. Most of those viewfinders do not capture more light than your eye does, but some do. It's better to be safe than sorry. You can't expect everyone to be able to tell whether their viewfinder is dangerous or not. So, in a warning addressed to the general population, just tell them to stay away from it.</p>

<p>Now, if you install a full-aperture solar filter (like the Baader solar film) ahead of the viewfinder, then it's safe to use - provided the filter is attached firmly to the camera and cannot be blown away by some random gust of wind.</p>

","<p>Your logic isn't unsound. By symmetry there would be a gravitational neutral point between them.</p>

<p>Of course, the black holes could not then be described by the Schwarzschild metric, since that only applies to a spherically symmetric situation.</p>

"What is the ultimate fate of a cluster of galaxies?","410","","<p>We're fairly aware clusters of galaxies drift apart due to space expansion, which will drive them out of each other's cosmic event horizon eventually, leaving them separate, alone, each a single ""body"" within its local observable universe with no means to communicate or influence other clusters.</p>

<p>The clusters themselves are held together by gravitational binding that keeps them from being internally torn apart by space expansion, at least assuming density of dark energy doesn't increase drastically eventually.</p>

<p>What will happen to the cluster though? At first I assumed its black holes will swallow all its available matter, and connect into one single, lonely black hole. But then, neither are black holes ultimately eternal, due to Hawking Radiation, nor do they swallow <em>all</em> the stars, supposedly most stars escaping their gravity well.</p>

<p>Well then, what current theories say a local cluster of galaxies will transform into as t→∞ ?</p>
","<p>As you point out, in an accelerating Universe, large scale structures will become more and more isolated. So at a certain point you will have gravitationally bound superclusters separated by very large voids and less and less filamentary structures.</p>

<p>Once isolated, we can then study the dynamics of these independent superclusters. On very large time scales, galaxies will collide and merge. After collisions you will tend to form elliptical galaxies. So I think that you will end up with a big single elliptical galaxy.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xX0kp.jpg"" alt=""Elliptical galaxy""></p>

<p>Then we can be interested in the future of the stars of these galaxies. First we currently see that the star formation rate has already peaked some billion years ago. So as the number of galaxies collision that usually targets star formation, the star formation rate will slowly continue to decrease. Moreover, as heavy elements (all elements apart from hydrogen and helium) are formed in stars, the future generation of stars will have more and more heavy elements. From the nuclear point of view, the most stable element is iron, so on very very large time scales light elements will be converted into iron, whereas heavy elements will decay into iron.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TEJJf.png"" alt=""Evolution of the star formation rate""></p>

<p>This is a little speculative, but I think that on large time scales, more and more interstellar gas and stars will fall at the center of the gravitational potential of super elliptical galaxy. So as the density will increase at the center, you will mechanically form a heavier and heavier supermassive black hole. Another interesting point is that we do not currently know whether proton are stable or not. So on time scales larger than $10^{30}$ years (see more details <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>) protons may naturally decay into lighter subatomic particles.</p>

<p>So maybe as $t\rightarrow\infty$ we will end up with supermassive black holes and light particles. But as you mentioned, black holes will themselves slowly lose mass by Hawking radiation. In the same time, the expansion rate may have increased significantly leading ultimately to isolated particles in an expanding Universe.</p>

"How are black holes doors to other universes?","409","","<p>I'm watching MIT OpenCourseWare lectures on general relativity and not too long into the first lecture the professor stated that the Kerr Black Hole solution allowed for travel between universes. How is that possible to know? How does one derive this/come to this conclusion?</p>
","<p>It is correct that the Kerr black hole solution of GTR allows travel between universes. However, that does not mean that if you actually jump into any kind of black hole that you could go to another universe.</p>

<p>To motivate the resolution to this conundrum, let's start off very easy: suppose you stand on the ground with a ball in your hand, and you throw it with some initial velocity. For simplicity, let's ignore everything except a uniform gravity. Mathematics will then tell you that the ball follows a parabolic arc, and when and where the ball will hit the ground. And if you take the resulting equations too literally, then it will also tell you that the ball hits the ground <em>twice</em>: once in the future, once in the past. But you know the past solution isn't right: you held the ball; it didn't actually continue its parabolic arc into the past.</p>

<p>A morally similar kind of thing occurs for, say, a Schwarzschild black hole. If you look at it in the usual Schwarzschild coordinates, there's a problem at the horizon. Mathematics will then tell you that the problem is just with the coordinate chart, and that there's actually an interior region to the black hole that becomes apparent in different coordinates. And if you do this generally enough, it will tell you that there's <em>more</em> to it than even that: there's also white hole with a reverse horizon and its exterior region--another universe. This full ""maximally extended"" Schwarzschild spacetime has this other universe connect to ours via an ""Einstein-Rosen bridge"" and then ""pinch off"", producing separate black and white holes.</p>

<p>Of course, that too is an artifact of mathematical idealization: and actual black hole is not infinitely extended in the past and future; it was actually produced by something, a stellar collapse. (And the ""bridge"" isn't traversable anyway; one will be destroyed in the singularity if one tries.)</p>

<p>Finally, on to the Kerr solution, it's a bit better because formally the singularity is avoidable, unlike the Schwarzschild case. However, it's still physically unreasonable: in addition to the fact that actual black holes aren't eternal, the interior of the Kerr solution is unstable in regard to any infalling matter, which will perturb the solution into something else entirely. Therefore, it cannot be taken as a physically meaningful. Still, it is true that full Kerr spacetime contains a way into another universe--in fact, infinitely many of them, chained one after another.</p>

<p>The way I see it, the universe itself was very small 14 billion years ago and has been steadily accelerating in size since.  So the photons that left a star that existed 14 billion years ago couldn't travel for 14 billion years because the universe itself was probably only a few million light years total in diameter.  The universe is not expanding faster than the speed of light, so that photon should have hit the end of the universe before now.</p>

","<p>If a star 300,000 km away from you explodes, it'll normally take the radiation from that explosion one second to start vaporizing you.
If the space between you and that exploding star inflates to 2.6X10^23km (28 billion ly) one half second after the explosion, the radiation will take 14 billion years, plus a half second, to reach you, and won't vaporize you.
Of course the expansion need not be instantaneous. You can plug in about any function you want there. The important thing is not the distance between you and the star at the time of explosion, but the total distance the photon must travel on its path to you. That distance must take into account the expansion of space between the emitted radiation and you, the observer.</p>

Could it be possible what we see today are what's left, i.e. countless planets or moons have been swung out of the Solar System and collided, until a stable (relatively speaking) system is reached as we observe today?</p>
","<p>I think at our current stage of solar system evolution, because of the fact that we have been able to evolve to our current level of sophistication, it could be considered to be very stable and in a very calm period in its evolutionary history. Unstable objects usually will be flung out very early on in the formation of such a system, hence why we do not see them today. However, just look at the Earth-Moon evolutionary history. It is theorised that our current Moon was captured due to a collision between Earth and perhaps a Mars (or similar size) object. This is anything but stable.</p>

<p>The reason why, is of course, related to gravity. Or more correctly, the gravitational potential of the system. All systems want to thermalise (in the same sense that a room of air molecules want to reach a thermal equilbirium). Although our solar system is anything but thermalised, it is constantly working to achieve this. Hence, why, at our present state of the solar system's evolution, we seem like we are in a fairly calm state. At this state, to go into more depth, we can employ Bertrand's theorem which tells us that for a central potential with an $r^{-1}$ dependance on radial distance the orbits will be stable. The stability of orbits in three spatial dimensions is due to the fact that the gravitational potential decreases with distance $r$ as $r^{-1}$.      </p>

","<p>This is a tricky question, not immediate. </p>

<p>If we talk about Main Sequence stars, yes, you can constrain your fictional star by two parameters. The crucial parameters in the diagram, as you said, are the mass and the radius. This is why the HR diagram well represents the stellar population with two axis. Of course, for your scope, we need to do some assumptions. For example, the metallicity, that for your purposes can be fixed as the Solar one. Or, that the initial mass is already in a condition to contract.</p>

<p>You can see it this way: the luminosity is connected with the radius (because it depends on the irradiating surface), while the temperature is connected with the mass (the more is the mass, the more is the pressure at the center of the star).</p>

<p>If you have $L \sim RT$ and $L \sim M$, then you also have $RT \sim M$. 
The degeneracy from one parameter can be overcame if you have your reference star (the Sun), which allows you to trace isoradii lines on the HR diagram. See here for example:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0sS3I.gif"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Or, that is equivalent, you can express your first equation (Stefan-Boltzmann), in Solar units as well (<a href=""http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast122/lectures/lec11.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">as shown here</a>).</p>

<p>Try it out just by your self: choose a mass, or observationally speaking, choose a luminosity. Then <a href=""http://www.kcvs.ca/martin/astro/au/unit4/85/chp8_5.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trace your line on the HR diagram</a>, and find your star. That star has a defined temperature (spectral class), Mass and Radius as well.</p>

<p>If you need the exact equations, feel free to ask please.</p>

<p>Nice aim, anyway. Have fun!</p>

"Determining effect of small variable force on planetary perihelion precession","406","","<p>Is there an analytical technique for determining the effect of a small variable transverse acceleration upon the rate of aspides precession (strictly not a precession but rotation of the line of aspides) of a planet orbitting around the Sun in a 2D plane according to Newtonian gravity law?  </p>

<p>I have modelled such effects in a reiterative computer model and would like to verify those measurements.  </p>

<p>The transverse acceleration formula is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$$At = (K/c^2)*Vr*Vt * Ar.$$</p>

<p>Where:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>c</em> is speed of light, </p>
  
  <p>K is a constant of magnitude between 0 and +/-3, such that $K/(c^2) &lt;&lt; 1$. </p>
  
  <p>Ar is the acceleration of the planet towards the Sun due to Newtonian gravitational influence of the Sun, ($Ar = GM/r^2$).</p>
  
  <p>Vr is radial component of planet velocity relative to the Sun (+ = motion away from the Sun)</p>
  
  <p>Vt is transverse  component of planet velocity relative to the Sun (+ = direction of planet forward motion along its orbital path). Vectorially Vt = V - Vr where V is the total instantaneous velocity vector of the planet relative to the Sun. </p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>The reason why this is interesting to me is that a value of K = +3 in my computer model produces anomalous (Non-Newtonian) periapse rotation rate values very close within about 1% of those predicted by General Relativity and within a few percent of those observed by astronomers (Le Verrier, updated by Newcomb).</p>

$$
\boldsymbol{\omega}=24.\pi^3.a^2.T^{-2}.c^{-2}.(1-e^2)^{-1}
$$</p>

<p>UPDATE 4</p>

<p>I have accepted Walter's answer.  Not only did he answer the original question (Is there a technique...?) but also his analysis produces a formula which not only confirms the computer-simulated effects of the transverse acceleration formula (for K = 3) but which also (unexpectedly to me) is essentially equivalent to the Einstein 1915 formula.</p>

<p>from Walter's Summary (in Walter's answer below):-</p>

<p>: (from first order peturbation analysis) semi-major axis and eccentricity are unchanged, but the direction of periapse rotates in the plane of the orbit at rate $$ \omega=\Omega \frac{v_c^2}{c^2} \frac{K}{1-e^2}, $$ where $\Omega$ is the orbital frequency and $v_c=\Omega a$ with $a$ the semi-major axis. Note that (for $K=3$) this agrees with the general relativity (GR) precession rate at order $v_c^2/c^2$ (given by Einstein 1915).</p>
","<p>You may want to use <strong>perturbation theory</strong>. This only gives you an <em>approximate</em> answer, but allows for analytic treatment. Your force is considered a small perturbation to the Keplerian elliptic orbit and the resulting equations of motion are expanded in powers of $K$. For linear perturbation theory, only terms linear in $K$ are retained. This simply leads to integrating the perturbation along the unperturbed original orbit. Writing your force as a vector, the perturbing acceleration is
$$
\boldsymbol{a} = K \frac{GM}{r^2c^2}v_r\boldsymbol{v}_t
$$
with $v_r=\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}$ the radial velocity 
($\boldsymbol{v}\equiv\dot{\boldsymbol{r}}$) and
$\boldsymbol{v}_t=(\boldsymbol{v}-\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}(\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}))$ the rotational component of velocity (the full velocity minus the radial velocity). Here, the dot above denotes a time derivative and a hat the unit vector.</p>

<p>Now, it depends what you mean with '<em>effect</em>'. Let's work out the changes of the orbital semimajor axis $a$, eccentricity $e$, and direction of periapse. </p>

<hr>

<p>To <strong>summarise the results below</strong>: semi-major axis and eccentricity are unchanged, but the direction of periapse rotates in the plane of the orbit at rate
$$
\omega=\Omega \frac{v_c^2}{c^2}
\frac{K}{1-e^2},
$$
where $\Omega$ is the orbital frequency and $v_c=\Omega a$ with $a$ the semi-major axis. Note that (for $K=3$) this <strong>agrees with the general relativity (GR) precession rate</strong> at order $v_c^2/c^2$ (given by Einstein 1915 but not mentioned in the original question).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>change of semimajor axis</strong></p>

<p>From the relation $a=-GM/2E$ (with $E=\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{v}^2-GMr^{-1}$ the orbital energy) we have for the change of $a$ due to an external (non-Keplerian) acceleration
$$
\dot{a}=\frac{2a^2}{GM}\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{a}.
$$
Inserting $\boldsymbol{a}$ (note that $\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{v}_t=h^2/r^2$ with angular momentum vector $\boldsymbol{h}\equiv\boldsymbol{r}\wedge\boldsymbol{v}$), we get
$$
\dot{a}=\frac{2a^2Kh^2}{c^2}\frac{v_r}{r^4}.
$$
Since the orbit average $\langle v_r f(r)\rangle=0$ for any function $f$ (see below), $\langle\dot{a}\rangle=0$. </p>

<p><strong>change of eccentricity</strong></p>

<p>From $\boldsymbol{h}^2=(1-e^2)GMa$, we find
$$
e\dot{e}=-\frac{\boldsymbol{h}{\cdot}\dot{\boldsymbol{h}}}{GMa}+\frac{h^2\dot{a}}{2GMa^2}.
$$
We already know that $\langle\dot{a}\rangle=0$, so only need to consider the first term. Thus,
$$
e\dot{e}=-\frac{(\boldsymbol{r}\wedge\boldsymbol{v}){\cdot}(\boldsymbol{r}\wedge\boldsymbol{a})}{GMa}
         =-\frac{r^2\;\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{a}}{GMa}
         =-\frac{Kh^2}{ac^2}\frac{v_r}{r^2},
$$
where I have used the identity
$(\boldsymbol{a}\wedge\boldsymbol{b}){\cdot}(\boldsymbol{c}\wedge\boldsymbol{d})
=\boldsymbol{a}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{c}\;\boldsymbol{b}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{d}-
 \boldsymbol{a}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{d}\;\boldsymbol{b}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{c}$ and the fact $\boldsymbol{r}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{a}_p=0$.
Again $\langle v_r/r^2\rangle=0$ and hence $\langle\dot{e}\rangle=0$.</p>

<p><strong>change of the direction of periapse</strong></p>

<p>The <em>eccentricity vector</em>
$
\boldsymbol{e}\equiv\boldsymbol{v}\wedge\boldsymbol{h}/GM - \hat{\boldsymbol{r}}
$
points (from the centre of gravity) in the direction of periapse, has magnitude $e$, and is conserved under the Keplerian motion (validate all that as an exercise!). From this definition we find its instantaneous change due to external acceleration
$$
\dot{\boldsymbol{e}}=
\frac{\boldsymbol{a}\wedge(\boldsymbol{r}\wedge\boldsymbol{v})
     +\boldsymbol{v}\wedge(\boldsymbol{r}\wedge\boldsymbol{a})}{GM}
     =\frac{2(\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{a})\boldsymbol{r}
       -(\boldsymbol{r}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{v})\boldsymbol{a}}{GM}
     =\frac{2K}{c^2}\frac{h^2v_r\boldsymbol{r}}{r^4}
     -\frac{K}{c^2}\frac{v_r^2\boldsymbol{v}_t}{r}
$$
where I have used the identity 
$\boldsymbol{a}\wedge(\boldsymbol{b}\wedge\boldsymbol{c})=(\boldsymbol{a}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{c})\boldsymbol{b}-(\boldsymbol{a}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{b})\boldsymbol{c}$
and the fact $\boldsymbol{r}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{a}=0$. The orbit averages of these expression are considered in the appendix below. If we finally put everything together, we get
$
\dot{\boldsymbol{e}}=\boldsymbol{\omega}\wedge\boldsymbol{e}
$
with [<em>corrected again</em>]
$$
\boldsymbol{\omega}=\Omega K \frac{v_c^2}{c^2}
(1-e^2)^{-1}\, \hat{\boldsymbol{h}}.
$$
This is a rotation of periapse in the plane of the orbit with angular frequency $\omega=|\boldsymbol{\omega}|$. In particular $\langle e\dot{e}\rangle=\langle\boldsymbol{e}{\cdot}\dot{\boldsymbol{e}}\rangle=0$ in agreement with our previous finding.</p>

<p>Don't forget that due to our usage of first-order perturbation theory these results are only strictly true in the limit $K(v_c/c)^2\to0$. At second-order perturbation theory, however, both $a$ and/or $e$ may change. In your numerical experiments, you should find that the orbit-averaged changes of $a$ and $e$ are either zero or scale stronger than linear with perturbation amplitude $K$.</p>

<p><strong>disclaimer</strong> No guarantee that the algebra is correct. Check it!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Appendix: orbit averages</strong></p>

<p>Orbit averages of $v_rf(r)$ with an abitrary (but integrable) function $f(r)$ can be
directly calculated for any type of periodic orbit. Let $F(r)$ be the antiderivative of $f(r)$, i.e. $F'\!=f$, then the orbit average is:
$$
\langle v_r f(r)\rangle = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T v_r(t)\,f\!\left(r(t)\right) \mathrm{d}t
= \frac{1}{T} \left[F\left(r(t)\right)\right]_0^T = 0
$$
with $T$ the orbital period.</p>

<p>For the orbit averages required in $\langle\dot{\boldsymbol{e}}\rangle$, we must dig a bit deeper. For a Keplerian elliptic orbit
$$
\boldsymbol{r}=a\left((\cos\eta-e)\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}+\sqrt{1-e^2}\sin\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\right)\qquad\text{and}\qquad
r=a(1-e\cos\eta)
$$
with eccentricity vector $\boldsymbol{e}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\equiv\hat{\boldsymbol{h}}\wedge\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}$ a vector perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{e}$ and $\boldsymbol{h}$. Here, $\eta$ is the eccentric anomaly, which is related to the mean anomaly $\ell$ via
$
\ell=\eta-e\sin\eta,
$
such that $\mathrm{d}\ell=(1-e\cos\eta)\mathrm{d}\eta$ and an orbit average becomes
$$
\langle\cdot\rangle = (2\pi)^{-1}\int_0^{2\pi}\cdot\;\mathrm{d}\ell = (2\pi)^{-1}\int_0^{2\pi}\cdot\;(1-e\cos\eta)\mathrm{d}\eta.
$$
Taking the time derivative (note that $\dot{\ell}=\Omega=\sqrt{GM/a^3}$ the orbital frequency) of $\boldsymbol{r}$, we find for the instantaneous (unperturbed) orbital velocity
$$
\boldsymbol{v}=v_c\frac{\sqrt{1-e^2}\cos\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}-\sin\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}}{1-e\cos\eta}
$$
where I have introduced $v_c\equiv\Omega a=\sqrt{GM/a}$, the speed of the circular orbit with semimajor axis $a$. From this, we find the radial velocity $v_r=\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{v}=v_c e\sin\eta(1-e\cos\eta)^{-1}$
and the rotational velocity
$$
\boldsymbol{v}_t = v_c\frac{\sqrt{1-e^2}(\cos\eta-e)\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}-(1-e^2)\sin\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}}{(1-e\cos\eta)^2}.
$$</p>

<p>With these, we have [<em>corrected again</em>]
$$
\left\langle \frac{h^2v_r\boldsymbol{r}}{r^4}\right\rangle = 
\Omega v_c^2\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\,
\frac{e(1-e^2)^{3/2}}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\sin^2\!\eta}{(1-e\cos\eta)^4}\mathrm{d}\eta
=\frac{\Omega v_c^2e}{2(1-e^2)}\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}
\\
\left\langle \frac{v_r^2\boldsymbol{v}_t}{r}\right\rangle = \Omega v_c^2\,
\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\,
\frac{e^2(1-e^2)^{1/2}}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\sin^2\!\eta(\cos\eta-e)}{(1-e\cos\eta)^4}\mathrm{d}\eta=0,
$$
in particular, the components in direction $\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}$ average to zero. Thus [<em>corrected again</em>]
$$\left\langle 2\frac{h^2v_r\boldsymbol{r}}{r^4}-\frac{v_r^2\boldsymbol{v}_t}{r}\right\rangle
=\frac{\Omega v_c^2e\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}}{(1-e^2)}

<p><sup>Human cone response, normalized to the same height. In reality, the response of the blue cones is significantly smaller, and the green is somewhat larger (from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision"">Wikipedia</a>).</sup></p>

<p>If an object emits light <em>only</em> at, say, 450 nm, the ratio is roughly 0.1:0.2:1 (in the order R:G:B); it then looks a special way to us, and we call it ""blue"", or maybe ""violet"". If it emits at 550 nm, or 650 nm, we call it ""green"" or ""red"". An object that emits light in a more continuous spectrum that covers the region 500–600 nm, we'd name something like orange-/brown-/olive-ish, depending on the exact spectrum.</p>

<p>The Sun emits photons at all wavelengths, but not in an equal amount at all wavelengths. The particular ratios between the three bands that we can see, we have labeled ""white"". However, when the Sun's light enters our atmosphere, some of the light is absorbed, especially at the blue wavelength. Filtering out the blue results in a spectrum that looks more orange to us. The figure below shows the Sun's ""true"" spectrum (in yellow), and the spectrum seen from the surface of Earth (in red):</p>

<p>Sometimes we want to observe the Sun in a wavelength region that is invisible to humans, for instance in UV or X-rays. This can be done with a telescope and a detector that is sensitive to light in that particular region, but in order for us to see it, we represent the image with a color that we <em>can</em> see. The image in the top of the link you provide is taken with the European spacecraft <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory"">SOHO</a>'s instrument EIT at 19.5 nm, which we call ""extreme UV"", bordering on soft X-rays. Since this is invisible to humans, they arbitrarily chose to represent it using green. They might as well have chosen pink or brown.</p>

"Please Guide me to buy my first Telescope","403","","<p>I am a beginner and I've planned to buy a telescope(Newtonian reflector)for viewing planets and deep sky objects. As far as I know the most important factor to get a brighter view is that the telescope need to have a good aperture. I need a telescope that would be good both for viewing planets and deep sky objects.So my question is here as a <strong>beginner</strong> how much aperture is necessary to get amazed with the space. And I don't know much regarding telescope so please let me know the other factors for getting good view of celestial objects.</p>
","<p>It's a broad question, but I'll take a stab trying to provide the essentials for a good start. Also see this post which contains important additional information:</p>

<p><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/2193/best-telescope-for-the-viewing-of-nebulae-stars-and-planets/2198#2198"">Best telescope for the viewing of Nebulae, Stars and Planets</a></p>

<p>There are many, many factors involved in choosing a telescope. You seem settled on a dobsonian. That's not the only possible choice, but a dob is a good scope to start with.</p>

<p>You are correct that aperture (diameter of the primary lens or mirror) is the primary driver of telescope performance. Bigger aperture = better performance. However, performance is not the only thing you should worry about. Think of a car - do you only care about speed when buying a new car?</p>

<p>Any size scope will show you something. I've a 50 mm (2"") achromat refractor that does double duty as finderscope. I can push it up to 100x magnification, and it will show lots of craters and mountains on the Moon, will show Jupiter as a disk with two equatorial belts, will show the rings of Saturn, will show the M13 globular cluster (barely) and the M31 Andromeda galaxy (again, barely). Not bad for a little scope.</p>

<p>A small 150 mm ... 250 mm (6"" ... 10"") dob will show you more. When seeing is good, you see several belts on Jupiter, and even individual curls on the big belts. Saturn's rings start to show the divisions, such as Cassini. These days Mars is at opposition - such a scope will show you the polar ice cap and the major land features. M13 fills the eyepiece with a dust of stars. The Orion Nebula looks big and clear even in the city. The Ring Nebula is visible, etc. Under a very dark sky, you can see (barely) the 3C 273 quasar, at 2.4 billion light years.</p>

<p>A mid-size dob (12"" ... 18"") will show you even more. More details on the planets, when seeing permits. More faint fuzzies (galaxies, nebulae, star clusters) especially out and far away from the city.</p>

<p>A large dob (20"" and over) is an amazing instrument. On those very rare occasions when seeing cooperates, Jupiter at 1000x in such a scope is unforgettable. Also, under a very dark sky out in the desert, point it anywhere and the sky is full of faint fuzzies.</p>

<p>So, which size should you choose? It depends on price, maintenance, and ease of use (size, etc). Let's talk about maintenance.</p>

<hr>

<p>As a dob owner, there are two things you must never forget: collimation, and cooling.</p>

<p><strong>Collimation</strong></p>

<p>It means ""keeping all the optics aligned and centered"". The mirrors will move around a bit, and in time will lose collimation. As a dob owner, you have to collimate the scope once in a while (and every time before you observe high-resolution targets such as planets). Once you learn how to do it, it takes about 2 minutes, it's super-quick and easy.</p>

<p>This is why collimation is important:</p>

<p><a href=""http://legault.perso.sfr.fr/collim.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://legault.perso.sfr.fr/collim.html</a></p>

<p>This is an introduction to dobsonian collimation:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cloudynights.com/documents/primer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.cloudynights.com/documents/primer.pdf</a></p>

<p>Here are some simpler collimation techniques, which you can use until you acquire all the tools:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.etnaastros.com/documents/No_Tools_Collimation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.etnaastros.com/documents/No_Tools_Collimation.pdf</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-to-collimate-your-newtonian-reflector/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-to-collimate-your-newtonian-reflector/</a></p>

<p>Also see the manual that comes with the scope.</p>

<p><strong>Cooling</strong></p>

<p>If you keep the scope in the house or garage, and then take it out for observation, the primary mirror will be much hotter than the night air. As a result, air convection will appear on the mirror and distort the image - just like the shimmering you see in the summer along the hot walls of a house under sunlight. The mirror is too ""hot"" for the ambient.</p>

<p>This is what happens:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/55"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/55</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/69"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/69</a></p>

<p>To combat convection, take the scope outside at least 1 hour prior to observation, and let it cool off. Very small dobs (up to 6"" or so) will probably work fine just with passive cooling. Small-medium and above (10"" or above) basically require a fan on the primary mirror (forced cooling).</p>

<p>Always collimate and cool off the scope before you do an observation requiring high resolution (when observing planets, the Moon, double stars). If you don't need a lot of high resolution (like when observing galaxies, nebulae, star clusters) then collimation and cooling are not so important.</p>

<p>If you keep your dob collimated and cooled, it will provide great views of the planets. There is this myth out there that dobs ""are not great for planets"", and refractors are somehow magically ""so much better for planets"". This is not true. The myth exists only because of the large number of people out there who keep their dobs in terrible shape; those poor scopes underperform by a very large margin. Don't be one of those folks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let me just draw a line in the sand for you: An 8"" f/6 dob is a good start overall. Why is that?</p>

<p>At 8"", it is big enough that it will be seeing-limited most of the time. In other words, it is so big, atmospheric turbulence will limit the resolution more often than the size of the scope.</p>

<p>It is big enough to show you some faint fuzzies even from the city. All the Messier objects should be visible no matter where you are.</p>

<p>It is not too big to fit on the back seat of a sedan car, if you want to drive to a place with a darker sky. It is not too big to move around in the backyard easily.</p>

<p>The mirror is not so big and thick as to mandate active cooling (fan on the mirror); you can pretty much get by with passive cooling only - take it out at least 1 hour before observation. However, a fan may improve things a bit anyway (you need to experiment with that, but it's not a priority at this size).</p>

<p>At f/6 it's not too hard on the eyepieces, and it's not too hard to collimate. A shorter scope (f/5 and below) produces a steeper light cone; you need higher quality (and price) eyepieces to use it, and collimation requires much better precision.</p>

<p>Finally, the price is right - a few hundred dollars, which is affordable for quite a few people. Take care of it and it will last you a lifetime.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, if you can afford it and think you can deal with the steeper learning curve, could you buy a bigger instrument? Sure. 16"", 18"" - the wallet is the limit. Such big dobs are made differently - they are called ""truss dobs"". They don't have a big tube where everything is contained. Instead, the tube is replaced by a truss made of a bunch of poles - looks like the arm of a crane machine.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sRw1Y.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>When you're done observing, you disassemble it. It all fits in a sedan car. It's not too heavy for transport, because you handle each part separately.</p>

<p>However, such an instrument is usually f/5 or less. Collimation is much more difficult. You need a coma corrector (like a Paracorr) to fix coma at the edge, and that's additional money. You need better eyepieces. Cooling doesn't work unless you use active cooling (fan). And it's just more expensive overall.</p>

<p>Can you start on a large dob like that? It's not impossible, but it requires more money and a much more significant commitment. This is not a toy that you can discard after two week-ends.</p>

"Why is Jupiter called so?","403","","<p>I have read before that Jupiter is named after the great Roman god because of how bright it is. I can't help but wonder, why wasn't the name given to Venus instead? Isn't Venus much brighter than Jupiter in the night-sky, or am I mistaken?</p>
","<p>I don't think this will be a great answer because these are just speculations. I cannot find concrete evidence or sources discussing why Jupiter (the planet) became associated with the ""king of gods"" and not Venus, but here's my go at citing some potential reasons.</p>

<p>To start, I want to point out that ultimately, we have to trace this back to the Greeks and Babylonians. Sure Jupiter (the planet) is named after the Roman god Jupiter, but really the Roman mythology traces pretty distinctly to Greek mythology and Greek mythology has strong ties to Babylonian mythology. The Greeks were the ones who associated Zeus with the planet Jupiter (and they were likely taking cues from the Babylonians) and the Romans just tagged along with that idea, but changed the god's name. So I think your question then transforms into, <em>Why didn't the Greeks/Babylonians decide to associate the planet Venus with their chief god (being that it is the brightest) and instead chose the planet Jupiter?</em></p>

<p><strong>Brightness of Venus and Jupiter</strong></p>

<p>First, let's just confirm that Venus is indeed brighter. If you look up the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"">Apparent Magnitude</a> system of Wikipedia, you see a description of how astronomers measure visible brightnesses of astronomical objects (and coincidentally enough, this system was created by a Greek). In this system, smaller and more negative numbers indicate brighter objects. From the table on that page, we can see that the apparent magnitude of Venus varies from $-4.89$ at its brightest to $-3.82$ at its dimmest (this variation is caused by the different configurations of Earth, Venus, Sun positions). For Jupiter, we see that at its brightest it has an apparent magnitude of $-2.94$ and a minimum of $-1.61$. Clearly, even at its brightest, Jupiter is far outshone by Venus at its dimmest. Note that none of this takes into account light pollution or other atmospheric effects which would have been negligible to the Greeks and Babylonians anyway. So we can say emphatically yes that Venus is distinctly brighter than Jupiter, but importantly, we note that Jupiter is still brighter than every other star in the sky $-$ the brightest being Sirius with a magnitude of $-1.47$.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion about Venus</strong></p>

<p>Okay, the Greeks and Babylonians were sitting around looking at these planets and wondering what they were. Likely they started thinking they were big, great deities and started attributing gods to them. I can't say this is a certainty, but one possible reason Venus didn't get the top god was that initially the Greeks and Babylonians weren't even sure Venus was a planet like the rest of the planets were. Because Venus is so close to the Sun, we only ever see it at sunrise and sunset. Otherwise, it is in the sky during the day and dwarfed by the brightness of the Sun. This meant that it took the ancient peoples a long time before they even realized the bright object they saw in the evening was the same as the bright object they saw in the morning. To quote <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_astronomy"">Wikipedia</a> on this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Observations of Venus are not straightforward. Early Greeks thought that the evening and morning appearances of Venus represented two different objects, calling it Hesperus (""evening star"") when it appeared in the western evening sky and Phosphorus (""light-bringer"") when it appeared in the eastern morning sky. They eventually came to recognize that both objects were the same planet. Pythagoras is given credit for this realization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Potentially, the ancient Greeks didn't even consider Venus to be a planet initially. The word planet is Greek and means ""wandering star"". The ancient Greeks identified objects in the night sky which were different and seemingly more important that the normal stars. However, initially, they don't seem to have grouped Jupiter and Mars in with the same type of object as Venus (and possibly Mercury). Jupiter's motion around the sky may have seemed more grandiose and full of purpose, hence why they attributed it to being their biggest and most important god.</p>

<p><strong>Love and Beauty</strong></p>

<p>As I said, the Babylonians, as well as the Greeks before they figured it out, didn't consider Venus to be a planet, but rather two separate and strange ""stars"". However, once they figured out the two ""stars"" were really one and the same and Venus was a planet just like Jupiter, they decided to attribute a proper god or goddess from the pantheon of gods to it. Jupiter was already taken so they had to pick someone else.</p>

<p>Despite that, I don't think the argument that Venus is brighter automatically means it should be the most important god. Note that Venus is named after the Roman goddess Venus (of course) who is also the Greek goddess Aphrodite. This is the Greek goddess of love and beauty and she herself was supposed to be exceedingly beautiful. Venus, the planet, is a beautiful sight to behold and it seems appropriate that the most radiant and beautiful planet be named after the most radiant and beautiful Goddess.</p>

"Best approximation for Sun's trajectory around galactic center?","402","","<p>What is the current best approximation for the path the Sun takes around the center of the Milky Way?</p>

<p>I have found some information on the approximate position of the Milky Way's center, the speed of the Sun's orbit, and the inclination/declination of the Sun's orbit. I have also seen models suggesting the Solar System oscillates up and down as it revolves around the galactic center.</p>

<p>I am wondering if there is any agreed upon approximation (a 3d plot of position vs time) that includes all of these factors.</p>
","<p>The Sun orbits in the Galactic potential. The motion is complex; it takes about 230 million years to make a circuit with an orbital speed of around 220 km/s, but at the same time it oscillates up and down with respect to the Galactic plane every $\sim 70$ million years and also wobbles in and out every $\sim 150$ million years (this is called epicyclic motion). The spatial amplitudes of these oscillations are around 100 pc vertically and 300 pc in the radial direction inwards and outwards around an average orbital radius (I am unable to locate a precise figure for the latter).</p>

<p>This is established by measuring how the Sun moves with respect to the average motion of the stars in the solar vicinity - the so-called local standard of rest. Estimates of the Sun's motion with respect to the LSR vary a little. According to <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9710077"" rel=""nofollow"">Dehnen &amp; Binney (1998)</a> the Sun <em>currently</em> moves at 10 km/s inwards, at about 5 km/s faster than the average star tangentially to the Galactic centre and at about 7 km/s upwards out of the Galactic plane. Though as I mentioned previously, these motions are of an oscillatory nature around the mean value. The Sun is currently about 8.5 kpc from the Galactic centre and about 20 pc ""north"" of the Galactic plane.</p>

<p>I leave it as an exercise for the reader to visualise this orbit. From a side-view it would look like a pseudo-sinusoidal oscillation. From above the disk it would look like a slightly eccentric ellipse with a very large precession.</p>

<p>All of the above assumes that the Sun moves in a smooth Galactic potential. In fact the presence of spiral arms, a Galactic bar and the clumpy presence of giant molecular clouds can and will perturb the Sun's Galactic orbit around the regular behaviour described above, so predicting the Galactic location of the Sun in a billion years or so is not necessarily going to be very accurate.</p>

","<p>Expansion means that distances are increasing as a function of time. Say if the distance between two galactic clusters is $D$, then in an expanding Universe the distance is governed by some strictly increasing function of time $a(t)$ called the scale factor where</p>

<p>Cosmology assumes that the Universe is on large scales the same everywhere (homogeneous) and the same in all directions (isotropic) so the above applies to all distances above a certain scale. The scale factor $a(t)$ can be found from the Friedmann equations and initial conditions.</p>

<p>Expansion is possible in Universes of both finite and infinite spatial extent.</p>

<p>As the volume of a (large enough) region of space increases in proportion to $[a(t)]^3$, but the amount of matter remains constant, the matter density changes in proportion to $[a(t)]]^{-3}$. Expansion however also decreases the kinetic energy of of its contents, so the energy density decreases by a greater factor if the contents has kinetic energy.</p>

","<p>The most-widely accepted hypothesis at the moment is that Mercury was struck by a large impactor that removed a significant fraction of its mantle (I believe this theory was originally proposed by <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987LPI....18..151C"">Cameron &amp; Benz in 1987</a>, and the qualitative theory hasn't changed very much). For planets that are close to their parent stars (such as Mercury), the collision with the secondary body likely occurs at high velocity due to the rapid orbit speeds there (> 40 km/s). As this is much larger than a typical rocky planet's escape velocity (~10 km/s), material is lost from the planet in these collisions. This collision is also more likely to be ""grazing,"" as ""direct hits"" are rare, and thus the outer parts of the planet are preferentially removed.</p>

","<p>Certainly not a black hole! That would not be stable situation at all.</p>

<p>The content of the core of a neutron star is the subject of much speculation. The possibilities fall into a number of categories. (i) An increasingly hard neutron equation of state, such that neutrons retain their identities as they are squeezed closer, but an increasingly repulsive many-body strong nuclear force provides support. (ii) Additional hadronic degrees of freedom, such that the neutrons (and protons) transform into other heavy hadrons such as lambda or sigma particles. (iii) Some sort of quark plasma. (iv) Boson condensations involving the neutrons decaying into pions or kaons with zero momentum.</p>

<p>There are a number of diagnostics of these possibilities: primarily, the maximum possible mass of a neutron star should decrease from about 3 solar masses for (i) down to about 1.5 solar masses for (iv). Secure measurements of a 2 solar mass neutron star would seem to rule out (iv), but even that seems not completely agreed. Another diagnostic is how quickly neutron stars can cool. The presence of quark matter or boson condensations should lead to much more rapid cooling by neutrino emission. Again, nothing conclusive has emerged yet.</p>

<p>Most giant planets have very similar radii for masses between about 0.5 and 10 times that of Jupiter. The reason for this is that they are largely supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The diversity in the radii (between about 0.7 and 2 times that of Jupiter) of such planets is not yet fully understood.</p>

<p>The plot below shows mass vs radius for ""planets"". The smaller (probably rocky/icy) planets do show a trend of increasing radius with mass (the solid line is where a theoretical relationship for rocky/icy planets has been used to estimate the mass from the radius). The gas giants above about 0.5 Jupiter masses show no trend and a small scatter.</p>

"In theory, is there anywhere in the universe where velocity=0?","399","","<p>Earth is traveling at a certain velocity.  Earth orbits the Sun at velocity X.  The sun is orbiting the center of our galaxy at velocity Y.  The galaxy is orbiting (something?) at velocity Z. On and on... </p>

<p>In relation to zero, Earth has a velocity of X + Y + Z + (?).</p>

<p>Is it theoretically possible that there would be a point in space where nothing is moving and velocity is essentially 0?  </p>

<p>If so, what would time look like at this point in space?</p>
","<p>Yes.</p>

<p>The velocities you list (X, Y, …) are all velocities with respect to some reference frame. But all reference frames are arbitrary, and you can always define a reference frame where the velocity of some object is exactly zero, as long as it's not accelerating.</p>

<p>For instance, Earth's velocity in the Sun's reference frame is X, but in its own reference frame, it's zero.</p>

<p>This is not just semantics; it is probably one of the most profound concepts in physics that there is no such thing as an ""absolute frame of reference"". Before Einstein, people thought that time and space are absolute, but Einstein taught us that everything is relative.</p>

<p>In cosmology, there <em>is</em> a special reference frame in which all matter <em>on average</em> is zero. The coordinates of this frame are called <em>comoving coordinates</em>, and in many cases it makes sense to regard this as the most natural reference frame. But it is important to remember that it is still just a choice, and that any other reference frame is equally legit, although a bad choice of reference may make certain calculations harder or impossible to solve. In comoving coordinates, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background"" rel=""nofollow"">cosmic microwave background</a> (CMB) is isotropic, i.e. it looks the same no matter which direction you look. But since Earth is traveling with a non-zero velocity in comoving coordinates (at an average of <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5087"" rel=""nofollow"">369 km s$^{-1}$</a>), the CMB is slightly blueshifted in the direction in which we're traveling, and slightly redshifted in the other direction.</p>

<p>What would time look like? <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation"" rel=""nofollow"">Time runs slower</a>, the faster you move. In any non-accelerating reference frame (an <em>inertial system</em>), time runs ""as it should"", but an observer in this frame who measures how time runs in a frame that has a non-zero velocity with respect to his/her frame, will see it run slower.</p>

"Evolution of the Hubble parameter","398","","<p>In the lambda-CDM model describing an accelerating Universe, the Hubble parameter is currently decreasing with time. Will it continue to decrease forever?</p>
","<p>The solution to the Friedmann equation in a flat universe is
$$H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho + \frac{\Lambda}{3},$$
where $\rho$ is the matter density (including dark matter) and $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant.</p>

<p>As the universe expands, $\rho$ of course decreases, but $\Lambda$ remains constant.</p>

<p>Thus the Hubble ""constant"" actually decreases from its current value $H_0$ and asymptotically tends towards $ H = \sqrt{\Lambda/3}$ as time tends towards infinity.</p>

<p>As $\Lambda = 3H_0^{2} \Omega_\Lambda$, and measurements suggest that $\Omega_{\Lambda} \simeq 2/3$, then $\Lambda \simeq 2H_0^2$, and the Hubble parameter will therefore decrease to approximately $\sqrt{2/3}$ of its present value <em>if</em> the cosmological constant stays constant.</p>

<p>Of course if $\Lambda = \Lambda(t)$, (ie not the basic $\Lambda$-CDM model) then the behaviour will be different.</p>

<p>EDIT: Another useful form of the solution (for the case of a constant vacuum energy density) is</p>

<p>$$H^2 = H_0^2 \left(  \frac{\Omega_r}{a^4} + \frac{\Omega_M}{a^3} + \frac{\Omega_k}{a^2} + \Omega_{\Lambda}\right),$$
where $H_0$ is the Hubble parameter now, $a(t)$ is the scale factor of the universe, $\Omega_r$ is the current (i.e. $a=1$) ratio of the radiation density to the critical density and $\Omega_M$, $\Omega_k$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ are the equivalent densities for the matter (baryonic and dark), curvature and (constant) vacuum energy densities.</p>

<p>As $a$ increases you can see that all three of the leading terms get smaller and the Hubble parameter decreases at all times. When $a$ is very large, $H$ approaches $\sqrt{\Omega_{\Lambda}} H_0$ as before.</p>

"Sky view from Stellarium software vs. Sky view with naked eye","397","","<p>I'm slowly starting to interest in astronomy. Currently I'm enjoying in stargazing but unfortunately place where I live is very light polluted. </p>

As per my research, base of Mountain El Teide is perfect for star-gazing so I tried to simulate El Teide location and date in the Stellarium software to see what I can expect. Based on the light pollution index (2) which Stellarium picked for me based on the location I got following picture:</p>

<p>Any personal star gazing experience from Tenerife location is more than welcome. For my first time I'll plan to not use any equipment (except maybe binoculars)</p>

","<p>From personal experience - yes your Stellarium picture looks like a good dark sky in the Canary Islands. Certainly, the Milky Way is plainly visible, with lots of detail available to the dark-adapted eye.

"Can Doppler shift make colors of two stars at same distance different?","396","","<p>As you know, Doppler effect can change the wavelength of the light.</p>

<p>Suppose there are two stars at same distance and same temperature. If one star is receding and the other star is approaching, their colors would look different.</p>

<p>What I want to know is, how probable is it that two stars show different colors because of Doppler shift? In other words, if two stars at same distance have different colors, say blue and red, then is it safe to assume that two stars have different surface temperature?</p>

<p>Actually, this was the question from the final exam for Wave &amp; Heat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q. Stars emit radiation whose spectrum is very similar to that of an ideal blackbody. Two stars, identical in size, are at the same distance from us. One of the stars appears reddish in color while the other one looks very blue. Choose the correct statement.</p>

  (b) The blue star is hotter.<br>

<p>I read that some stars near the galactic center moves very fast. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S2_(star)"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S2_(star)</a></p>

<p>If we only consider Planck distribution, only (b) is possible. I'm wondering whether (c) is also a realistic case, or it is only conceptually possible.</p>
","<p>As you correctly mention, there are rare stars which move particularly fast. Check also hypervelocity stars section <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_kinematics"">here</a>, where a stellar population moving at around $10^3 \textrm{km/s}$ is described (by the way, these velocities were most likely produced in the galactic center). Note also, that these stars are too fast to stay in the disk for long times. As another sidenote, galactic center in not accessible in visual due to dust extinction.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift"">Redshifts</a> are calculated particularly easy: 
$$z=\dfrac{v}{c}$$, 
where $v$ is the velocity along the line of sight, $c$ is the speed of light, $z=\dfrac{\delta\lambda}{\lambda}$ and $(v/c)^2\approx 0$ (which holds even for hypervelocity stars).</p>

<p>Because hypervelocity stars are rare, they most likely can be found only close to regular stars. Yet, being very optimistic, take $v=3\cdot 10^3 \textrm{km/s}$, and you obtain that $\dfrac{\delta\lambda}{\lambda}=10^{-2}$ under very favourable conditions. In general it is not small, but when it comes to colors, the change is negligible.</p>

<p>Say, green light at $\lambda=555 \textrm{nm}$ would now have $\lambda=550 \textrm{nm}$ or $560 \textrm{nm}$ in wavelegth, i.e. would still be very green. So Doppler effect has no bearing on your problem. </p>

<p>What has possible bearing, however, is <a href=""http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/webprojects2002/murphy/colour_and_interstellar_clouds.htm"">dust reddening</a>. One of the two stars might be obscured by the dust, unlike the other one, and look reddish. So, both b) and c) are possible answers.</p>

The second are the beast in the cores of most massive galaxies and have masses in the range $10^{6-10}$M$_\odot$. Finally, 'intermediate black holes' are speculative black holes in the range $10^{2-4}$M$_\odot$, which are postulated to exist as an evolutionary stage for supermassive black holes, but we have no firm evidence for their existence (though many an observation is interpreted as such).</p>

"Could the earth survive red giant Sun?","392","","<p>So my question is that, is not a lie that we are flying away from the sun slowly, that is increasing by time because the sun loss mass, so when the scientist usually talk that we will get swallow by Sun when it get red giant, do they count on this? I mean, we can get far enough to survive or they just calculate with the actual orbit?</p>
","<p>The answer is yes, there are many authors who do take mass loss from stars into account when trying to work out the fate of their planetary systems. Examples include <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4031"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Schroder &amp; Smith 2008</a>; <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3841"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Adams et al. (2013)</a>; <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2577"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Adams &amp; Bloch (2013)</a>.</p>

<p>It is thought that (e.g. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3894"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kalirai et al. 2008</a>) that the Sun will lose half its mass by the time it ends up as a white dwarf. Almost all of this mass loss occurs in the final hundred million years or so (in just over 7.5 billion years time) whilst the Sun is on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-giant_branch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">red giant branch</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_giant_branch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">asymptotic giant branch</a>. The mass loss that occurs before then is small in comparison - about $10^{-13}$ of a solar mass every year (see <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3807"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Noerdlinger 2008</a>), so losing less than 1% of its mass prior to the RGB.</p>

<p>Consideration of conservation of angular momentum alone leads to the idea that $M(t)R$ is constant, where $M(t)$ is the mass of the Sun as a function of time and $R$ is the semi-major axis of a planetary orbit. Thus <em>prior</em> to the RGB phase, the Earth's orbit expands by maybe 1.4 cm per year, or by a total of $7\times 10^{-4}$ au prior to the RGB.</p>

<p>However, during and after the RGB we see that the Earth ends up with an orbital radius of $\sim 1.5$ au (or in solar units, about 290 $R_{\odot}$) after the RGB and maybe 430 $R_{\odot}$ after the AGB. So, whilst the Sun is in the RGB/AGB phase and losing mass, the Earth moves outwards from about 215 to 430$ R_{\odot}$. Meanwhile, as it ascends the RGB, the Sun will likely increase in size to about $200 R_{\odot}$. Therefore it is a close-run thing as to whether the Earth will be engulfed within the outer envelope of the evolved Sun.
Major uncertainties include just exactly how big the Sun will get, how much mass it will lose on the RGB and then on the AGB, and it turns out that the time-profile of the mass loss (which will happen in pulses, rather than continuously) may also play a role.</p>

<p>The plot below (from Schroder &amp; Smith 2008) may help to make some sense of this. It shows the (log) of the radius of the Sun versus time in the RGB and AGB phases as it loses mass. Also shown with a dashed line is the orbital radius of the Earth. Fractions written on the plot show what fraction of the Sun's present mass remains.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kLbdh.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kLbdh.png"" alt=""Evolution of the Sun""></a></p>

<p>However, even if the Earth escapes immediate engulfment, the Sun would be several thousand times more luminous than it is today, so the temperatures at the surface of the Earth could reach $&gt;1000$ Celsius even if it stays an astronomical unit away from the Sun's surface.</p>

<p>A further issue is the effects of tidal dissipation. The Earth will be dragged back by tidal bulges induced in the Sun's extended envelope. The rate at which angular momentum is lost is however exquisitely sensitive to the exact radius of the Sun and the radius of the Earth's orbit, to the extent that their orders of magnitude uncertainty in whether the Earth will be dragged into the Sun's envelope even before it reaches the tip of the RGB (this is what Schroder &amp; Smith 2008 claim) or whether the loss rates will be too low to have much effect. It all depends on how much mass loss there is (Schroder &amp; Smith use a slightly lower estimate than above) and therefore what radius the Earth reaches and what the final radius of the Sun becomes.</p>

<p>At the moment I would say there is sufficient uncertainty that the fate of the Earth is undecided, but it will unarguably be uninhabitable.</p>

"Why is the core of a gas giant supported by electron degeneracy pressure instead of nuclear fusion?","392","","<p>After a Sun-sized protostar forms, its core will become denser over time due to radiation. The core eventually gets dense and hot enough for hydrogen fusion to take place. In the late phases of the star's life, the core will continue fusing hydrogen until it runs out and outer layers begin fusion hydrogen, while dumping helium into the core. The core will get massive enough that it will begin to contract, and it will eventually become electron degenerate due to the high densities.</p>

<p>However, as the core became denser and denser, it reached temperatures at which fusion could take place, but it did <em>not</em> become dense enough for the matter to become electron degenerate, right? Only later in its life, when the star's hydrogen ran out, would it become dense enough for that.</p>

<p>So then why would gas giant cores be electron degenerate, but not become hot enough for nuclear fusion? Shouldn't they start fusing before they can become electron degenerate, as stars do? Am I misunderstanding this concept entirely, or is there more to it than what I described?</p>
","<p>The test to see whether degeneracy pressure is going to be significant is to compare $kT$ with the Fermi energy $E_F$ </p>

<p>The Fermi energy is the energy level up to which all energy states would be occupied in a completely degenerate fermion gas. It is given by (for non-relativistic conditions)
$$ E_F = \frac{h^2}{2m}\left(\frac{3}{8\pi}\right)^{2/3} n^{2/3},$$
where $m$ and $n$ are the mass and number density of the fermions (in this case, electrons).</p>

<p>If $E_F \gg kT$, then the gas can be considered completely degenerate and the electrons exert a non-relativistic degeneracy pressure. If $E_F \sim 10 kT$ the electrons are partially degenerate.
In <em>both</em> these circumstances, the pressure exerted by the electrons is much higher than they would have in a perfect gas, because a large fraction of electrons occupy high energy (and momentum) states. </p>

<p>Degeneracy can be achieved either by having a low temperature or a high number density of fermions. In a white dwarf, electrons are completely degenerate because the number density of electrons is extremely high. In a gas giant, the electron density is nowhere near as high, but then the temperature is a lot lower and so they reach a state of partial degeneracy.</p>

<p>The pressure of a partially degenerate gas is higher than that of a perfect gas at the same density and temperature. More importantly, the pressure is only very weakly dependent on temperature. As a gas giant radiates away its potential energy, it is able to do so whilst only contracting very slightly and the core does not become hot enough to initiate nuclear fusion.</p>

<p>Note that degeneracy pressure and thermal pressure are not two different things. Both arise merely as a consequence of particles having a distribution of momenta and obeying (in this case) Fermi-Dirac statistics to determine how they occupy the possible energy states. The expression $P = nkT$ is simply a convenient approximation for fermions that holds only when $E_F \ll kT$ and the quantum nature of the particles is not apparent.</p>

I want to be an astronomer and I know that I have to get a B.Sc, then M.Sc, and then Ph.D in astronomy. I have also started to learn the python programming language. I came to know that there are less opportunities for research in astronomy, since many organizations like ISRO not only employ scientists, but also employ engineers to make satellites and spacecrafts. I will try my best to become an astronomer, but to have life security (if i am unemployed), can I do aeronautical engineering so that I can even get employed in ISRO? After having a degree in engineering and after doing engineering can i do M.Sc in physics and then i start preparing to be an astronomer?</p>

<p>Let me tell you about myself a bit, I love to study science and I love to learn about stars (I have also watched documentaries on astronomy like ""How the universe works"" and ""Cosmos""). I also love aircraft so aeronautical engineering would also be a job that I would love. And please tell me should I also do some extra courses which would enhance my skills as an astronomer?</p>
","<p>It is good to see that you are interested in astrophysics at an young age. 
No problem with you doing the clichéd BE that everyone in India is forced with, you can still get your PhD in Astrophysics. </p>

<p>Your 4 years of B.Tech aeronautical is going to be tough, so be prepared for it. In the mean time, keeping in mind your aim of becoming an astrophysicist, prepare yourself equipped with programming languages, especially Python/C++. The reason I say this is because <strong>you don't need too have much of an astronomy background to do M.Sc Astronomy</strong>, but you definitely <strong>need to have a good knowledge in a programming language.</strong> </p>

<p>There are websites like <a href=""http://www.courseera.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Course Era</a> or <a href=""http://www.edx.org"" rel=""nofollow"">EdX</a> and plenty more on the internet that can help you with learning python/C++ in an interactive way. Go for it, and trust me it will help you a lot.</p>

<h2>As a final year student doing my PhD in Astrophysics (hailing from India) let me tell you the information I have acquired over the years.</h2>

<p>With regard to the Masters/PhD in Astronomy/Astrophysics, the procedure is quite different in different countries. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Procedure within India</strong></p>

<p>There are plenty of Universities in India that offer you a Masters course in Astrophysics. </p>

<p>Almost all the details required are summarised neatly in <a href=""https://www.iiap.res.in/opportunities/career"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS PAGE</a>, 
so I am not going to go through the list of things required. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Procedure for Europe</strong></p>

<p>You would need:</p>

<ol>
<li>All your original mark sheets attested by the college/university (Bachelors, Masters, etc)</li>
<li>Two/three recommendation letters, and the number of letters depends on the university you are applying to. </li>
<li>A completely filled application form.</li>
<li>IELTS scores (depends on country)</li>
<li>Statement of purpose, as to why you want to do the course.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is pretty much all you need for Europe. For certain universities, you might be having a Skype interview, wherein they might ask you about the stuff you know. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Procedure for USA:</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to the USA, it gets quite complicated!</p>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ol>
<li>All your original mark sheets attested by the college/university (Bachelors, Masters, etc)</li>
<li>Two/three recommendation letters, and the number of letters depends on the university you are applying to. For most universities it will be online forms that your professor needs to fill after he/she receives the mail.</li>
<li>A completely filled application form. This is going to cost you somewhere from around 50-80 dollars depending on the university.</li>
<li>GRE scores (both general GRE and subject (Physics,Chemistry etc.) GRE) that you can send to the university directly online by paying money (25 Dollars for each university). Only a few universities accept you without a subject GRE.</li>
<li>IELTS/TOEFL scores. TOEFL scores can be sent online, but if you are taking IELTS you have to go to British council and have them send it. </li>
<li>Statement of purpose, as to why you want to do the course. </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>So it depends on where you want to apply. I would recommend you to apply to both, to increase your chances. <strong>For Europe</strong>, the chances of you getting through <strong>depends on the country</strong> you apply. <strong>For USA</strong>, the chances of you getting through <strong>solely depend on your GRE scores.</strong> It doesn't matter whether you are a gold medallist in your Bachelors, it all boils down to GRE. If you fail there, your entry into USA will be difficult.  </p>

<p>One advantage of Europe is that, mostly, the PhD is only for 3/4 years, depending on the country. Whereas in the USA, it is mandatory for the student to write exams in the first year, teach/be a research assistant in the second year, and only in the third year start the PhD project. </p>

<hr>

<p>To search for PhDs in Astrophysics depends on the country you are applying for. But as a start, you can have a look at <a href=""http://jobregister.aas.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobregister.aas.org/</a>. PhD calls, internship calls, post-doc positions, etc. related to astrophysics will be <strong>posted here during the start of every month.</strong> </p>

<p>With regard to your question </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>can I do aeronautical engineering so that I can even get employed in ISRO?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes you can definitely do that. ISRO not only employs aeronautical engineers, but also people who have completed their BE in electrical and electronics and also computer science. </p>

"How is a day measured on a gas giant?","390","","<p>After watching this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqXcXNUu1lg"" rel=""nofollow"">JPL video</a> of a Cassini time lapse of Saturn, I wondered since being mostly gases, how do we know how long a day—one rotation period—is?</p>

<p>Is there a usable relation between how fast the upper most layer of gases is and the planet's solid core?</p>
","<p>That the rotation period of the bulk mass of a planet is estimated through something with the magnetic field is true.</p>

<p>But let me maybe elaborate a bit in-depth on that.</p>

<p>No planetary magnetic field is a dipole. Earth has strong magnetic anomalies over the Atlantic, there may be ionic disturbances by moons like Io, or your magnetic field is just really crazy, like Uranus and Neptunes.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyLjY.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyLjY.jpg"" alt=""Magnetic Field model, showing multipolarity""></a>
(A simple, low-order model of Earth's magnetic field, from GFZ Potsdam)</p>

<p>But no matter how it looks, it will usually be constant on lines of latitude and longitude. This in particular signifies that the field and its distortions are created somehow by the bulk mass of the planet, else the field would move relative to a surface map, in the case of Earth.
So all this talk just to establish the following: We can take the shapes of the magnetic field as if they were surface shapes, and by following them determine a rate of rotation.</p>

<p>Now the story doesn't end there. While this sounds nice in principle, to do this in practice, we would need to send a probe and do in-situ measurments of this changing magnetic landscape.  </p>

<p>But what can be done from afar, and from Earth is observe ionospheric patterns. Because the ionosphere of a planet is well, ionized gas, at super-low pressures (roughly on the order of microbar to nanobar) it is frozen-in with the magnetic field that makes the particles of the plasma gyrate. This means, the ionospheric plasma follows the magnetic landscape, now translating into a plasma landscape. This plasma landscape is then usually observable from Earth by the radio signals they emit. It is also possible to see this in the ultraviolet, if there is strong plasma activity through auroral bombardment of a planet's upper atmosphere.</p>

<p>For your <strong>second question</strong>, that's a simple no. 
First of all there is no 'uppermost' layer of atmosphere, as the atmosphere is continously decreasing in density with increasing distance from the planetary body in question.<br>
What you're possibly thinking about are the upper cloud layers, as they visibly end at some height.<br>
But wind speeds are much more determined by pressure gradients created by the central star heating the planet, and the atmospheres ability to cool.<br>
There is one class of planet, however where a relation between the wind speeds at roughly 0.1 bar pressure and magnetic dynamo might exist. Those are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hot Jupiters</a> which host atmospheres that might be sufficiently ionized for its winds to be braked down by the planetary magnetic field.<br>
Then there would exist a limiting speed, given a certain planetary field. However this is still a field of active research, but it would give you 'a' relation between the two.</p>

"If the Universe is infinite, would heat death be impossible?","390","","<p>If the Universe is infinite, one would imagine that if we kept moving through space, we'd constantly find newer and newer galaxies and objects forever. This would imply that there is an infinite amount of matter in the Universe.</p>

<p>The heat death theory states that, eventually, there will be no free energy left in the Universe. Stars would no longer form, black holes would eventually evaporate, and the Universe would be effectively dead. But if there's an infinite amount of matter, won't there always be more gas clouds that haven't formed stars, more stars that have yet to become black holes, etc.? If there is an infinite amount matter and energy, shouldn't more activity be possible no matter how many stars go out or how many black holes evaporate?</p>

<p>One might say that with enough time, all matter in the Universe would still run dry. But if there is an <em>infinite</em> amount, there should always be areas in which activity is still going on...right?</p>

<p>Is what I'm saying correct? Does the heat death of the Universe contradict the theory that it is infinite?</p>
","<p>Heat death of the Universe doesn't mean that there is no energy in it, it means it has reached thermodynamic equilibrium and hence no useful energy in it. This could in theory occur in an infinite Universe.</p>

<p>Of course thermodynamics is statistical in nature, so an argument could be made that some extremely unlikely event in a region of the Universe could destroy thermal equilibrium in that region and that the larger the Universe the more likely that some region like that exists.</p>

"What are the chances of a star colliding with another during a galactic collision?","390","","<p>My specific example for the question is the future collision of the galaxies Milky Way (our own galaxy) and Andromeda in a couple billion years. The star in question is obviously the sun in this case. I want to know the chances of a collision with another star and if it's significant or not. </p>
","<p>Let's see what we get from some back-of-the-envelope estimates.</p>

<p>Imagine throwing one star (e.g., the Sun) at the other galaxy. How likely is it we'll hit a star in the other galaxy? Well, it's basically proportional to how big a target each star in the other galaxy is (its cross-sectional area) compared to the size of the whole galaxy, multiplied by the total number of stars in the target galaxy.</p>

<p>Let's assume it's the Milky Way-Andromeda scenario, so each galaxy has about 100 billion stars, and each star is roughly the same size as the Sun (some are much larger, most are smaller). The actual target area for an individual star is a circle with twice the star's radius (we're counting one star just grazing the other as a collision). Let's also assume the stars are more or less evenly distributed in a circular disk. Since ""100,000 light years"" is a common (and not completely crazy) estimate of the Milky Way's size, that's a circle of radius = 50,000 light years (about $10^{16}$ meters).</p>

<p>So: 100 billion stars in the target galaxy, each with target radius $\sim 2 R_{\odot}$, gives us a total target area of $10^{11} \times \pi (2 R_{\odot})^{2} \approx 10^{30}$ m$^{2}$.</p>

<p>The area of the target galaxy is $\pi R_{gal}^{2} \approx 10^{42}$ m$^{2}$. So the chance of our Sun hitting a star in the other galaxy is $\approx 10^{30} / 10^{42} = 10^{-12}$ -- or about one in a trillion.</p>

<p>The odds of <em>any</em> star from our galaxy hitting a star in the other galaxy would be $(1 - 10^{-12})^{10^{11}} \approx 0.90$.</p>

<p>So there's only about a 10% chance of one (or more) of the galaxy's 100 billion
stars hitting a star in the other galaxy. And the chances of any <em>one particular star</em> (like our Sun) hitting a star in the other galaxy is about one in a trillion.</p>

"Can a black hole rip spacetime","389","","<p>Can a black hole which has an enormous mass and spins so fast cause spacetime to to be stretched to is absolute limits that it  start so rip?  </p>
","<p>There is a useful model of spacetime as a rubber sheet that is bent by masses laying on it. But it should be remembered that this is an analogy (<a href=""https://xkcd.com/895/"" rel=""nofollow"">Obligatory xkcd)</a> and most analogies fail if pushed too far. Spacetime isn't made of something that can rip.</p>

<p>A rotating black hole, a ""Kerr black hole"" is stranger than a static one, as it pulls spacetime around it and can accelerate objects passing close to it. Even so there are no rips, no singularities outside the event horizon.</p>

<p>However in another way, at the centre of every black hole there is a singularity, and a singularity is a single point ""rip"" in spacetime. General relativity can be used to predict what happens to spacetime around the black hole, and even inside the event horizon.

"Why would the Earth's solar analemma would be still a figue eight even if Earth's orbit was circular?","389","","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma"" rel=""nofollow"">The Earth's solar analemma is a diagram showing the deviation of the Sun from its mean motion in the sky, as viewed from a fixed location on the Earth. ... For [a planet] with a <strong><em>circular orbit but significant axial tilt, the analemma would be a figure of eight</em></strong> with northern and southern lobes equal in size.</a></p>

<p>This statement seems to be true, but it doesn't make any sense to me. If the eight is not due to the equation of time, why is there an eight? Thanks.</p>
","<p>It is correct that the Earth's axial tilt alone would result in an analemma of a figure of eight with equally sized lobes.  The axial tilt contributes to the equation of time.</p>

<p><strong>Circular Orbit, no Axial Tilt</strong></p>

<p>Let's look at an example case with a perfectly circular orbit and no axial tilt, to observe what happens with no equation of time.  In this example, it's noon at the equator and prime meridian.  The Sun is directly overhead.  Next, the Earth rotates exactly once.  This isn't a normal solar day, but a sidereal day, about 23 hours, 56 minutes.  The Earth has rotated exactly once with respect to the stars.  Where is the Sun directly overhead now?  The Earth has moved a little bit in it's orbit around the Sun, so that our observer at the equator and 0 degrees longitude has observed that the Sun has moved in the sky with respect to the stars.  The Sun is now directly overhead at a location to the east, a little less than 1 degree longitude away (360 degrees in a circle, usually 365 days in a year).  The Earth must rotate a little more so that the Sun is directly overhead again (which completes the 24 hours in a day).</p>

<p>After each rotation, the Earth must rotate a little more each day to bring the Sun back overhead at 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude.  After a quarter of a year, the Earth must rotate another quarter of a rotation (90 degrees) for the Sun to be overhead at that spot.  Without that extra quarter of a rotation, the Sun is overhead at 90 degrees east longitude.  That makes sense; the Earth has moved 90 degrees in its orbit.  With a perfectly circular orbit, the rate at which this point moves eastward per day is constant, a little under a degree per day.</p>

<p>These points define a great circle around the Earth that coincides with the equator.  A great circle is a circle on the surface of a sphere whose center is also the center of the sphere; it's the biggest possible circle that can exist on the surface of a sphere.</p>

<p><strong>A Large Axial Tilt</strong></p>

<p>Let's keep Earth's perfectly circular orbit, but let's give it a very large axial tilt, 80 degrees, for the purpose of this explanation.  This Earth now begins at noon on the northward equinox at 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude.  After one Earth rotation, where on Earth is the Sun overhead now?  It's still a little less than one degree of angle away, but the direction of the displacement has changed.  Instead of this point moving due east, it is mostly northward and only a little bit east.  The Earth needs to rotate far less than 4 more minutes for the Sun to reach local noon for our observer at 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude.  These points are west of where they would be without axial tilt.  Solar noon has occurred before 24 hours have passed.  As days continue to pass after the equinox, solar noons continue to occur earlier each solar day, as these points continue mostly northward and only a little bit eastward.  The analemma shape as seen in the Northern hemisphere sky is moving up and to the right (west is to the right when looking south towards the Sun in the Northern hemisphere).</p>

<p>A quarter of a year later, it's the northern solstice, so let's see what has happened to our sun-overhead plots as the sidereal days have piled up.  These points have continued to move mostly northward and a little eastward, but now they are moving purely eastward, because at the solstice the sun has stopped moving northward in the sky.  It's still moving at a little less than 1 degree per day along that great circle, but because longitude lines are spaced much more closely together at 80 degrees latitude, one degree along a great circle covers many degrees of longitude.  In other words, the eastward movement of these points has been ""catching up"" with the longitude of the corresponding no-axial tilt points.  At the solstice, both the no-axial tilt point and the axial tilt point have the same longitude, 90 degrees east.  The analemma shape as seen in the Northern hemisphere sky is moving up and to the left (eastward), where it reaches its highest point.</p>

<p>These points will continue to move through longitude lines rapidly while the Sun's overhead point remains far in the north.  Now, the sun's overhead point is further east than it would be with no axial tilt.  The analemma shape as seen in the Northern hemisphere sky is moving down and to the left (eastward).</p>

<p>As the southward equinox approaches, the sun-overhead points are moving mostly southward and only a little eastward.  The analemma shape as seen in the Northern hemisphere sky is moving down and to the right (westward).  This allows the non-axial tilt points to ""catch up"", and the longitude differences begin to decrease again, until the time of the southward equinox comes, when the two points coincide again.</p>

<p>Here is a crude ASCII drawing of these points so far, with longitude along the horizontal direction, and latitude along the vertical direction.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The points around (1) are further west than their corresponding points on the equator. At (2), the points have caught up in longitude.  At (3), they are further east than their corresponding points on the equator, but the equator points are catching up.</p>

<p>After the southward equinox, the longitudes of the sun-overhead point diverge once again, with the same mechanism as described above for the northward equinox.  Just reverse north and south, and the eastward movements are the same.  The analemma shape as seen in the Northern hemisphere sky first moves down and to the right, then down and to the left where it reaches its lowest point at the southern solstice, then up and to the left, then up and to the right where it reaches its starting point at the northward equinox.</p>

<p><strong>Back to Reality</strong></p>

<p>With an axial tilt of 80 degrees, the equation of time would show some extreme values, approaching almost 6 hours of divergence from the no-axial tilt case.  With the true axial tilt of about 23.5 degrees, our equation of time difference values are far less substantial, but the effect is real.</p>

<p>The true analemma shape we see on Earth is the combined effect of the axial tilt that we have seen plus the fact that Earth's orbit is elliptical and it slows down during the parts of its orbit when it's farther from the Sun and it speeds up during the parts of its orbit when it's closer to the Sun.</p>

<p>The site <a href=""http://www.analemma.com/Pages/framesPage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Analemma</a> has good explanations about the individual effects of the elliptical orbit and the axial tilt and how they combine to create our analemma.</p>

","<h1>It's liquid.</h1>

<p>As detailed <a href=""http://www.space.com/3756-surprise-slosh-mercury-core-liquid.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To figure out whether Mercury's core was liquid or solid, a team of scientists led by Jean-Luc Margot at Cornell University measured small twists in the planet's rotation. They used a new technique that involved bouncing a radio signal sent from a ground telescope in California off the planet and then catching it again in West Virginia.</p>
  
  <p>After 5 years and 21 such observations, the team realized their values were twice as large as what would be expected if Mercury's core was solid.</p>

<p><a href=""http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/why_mercury/q4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The official site of the <em>Messenger</em> mission</a> is slightly more cautious:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, these constraints are limited because of the low precision of current information on Mercury's gravity field from the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER flybys. Fundamental questions about Mercury's core remain to be explored, such as its composition. A core of pure iron would be completely solid today, due to the high melting point of iron. However, if other elements, such as sulfur, are also present in Mercury's core, even at a level of only a few percent, the melting point is lowered considerably, allowing Mercury's core to remain at least partially molten as the planet cooled. Constraining the composition of the core is intimately tied to understanding what fraction of the core is liquid and what fraction has solidified. Is there just a very thin layer of liquid over a mostly solid core or is the core completely molten? Addressing questions such as these can also provide insight into the current thermal state of Mercury's interior, which is very valuable information for determining the evolution of the planet. </p>

<p>write noon on hoop's inside closest to ground, midnight opposite, 6 pm on the east side, 9 pm midway between the last two, and so on (hours only occurring in darkness optional).</p>

<p>If your sundial reads 6 pm at due west all the time then you're doing it wrong. Let's say I put a vertical stick in the ground, draw a 24 hour clock face around it, put noon poleward and think it's a sundial. In New York City, it could literally be saying 6 am when a genuine sundial says 9 am. That's just middle latitudes. At the equator on the equinox, it would read 6 am all morning and 6pm all afternoon at the equator. If you go 1 mile south of where the next noon, summer solstice and Tropic of Cancer coincide, it would say about 4:30am at sunrise, go forwards at first, then backwards, finally showing the middle 6 hours of the night passing in 7 seconds. Backwards. At noon. Then it will run forwards again until it reaches 7:30pm at sunset. If you place the stick right, you can even make it stay between 4:30a and 6a all morning, stop at 6 am at the instant of noon then instantly become midnight, run infinity years per second backwards for an infinitely short amount of time, go almost 6 hours backwards in seconds, then later forwards again very slowly until it shows about 7:30pm at sunset. This is why sundials cannot be made that way.</p>

<p>(of course, this is theoretical, there are no infinitely thin, vertical, and straight sticks, shadows are fuzzy, they can be too short to see, the Earth wobbles a bit, the speed of light is not infinite, this would only be true if only the Sun and Earth existed, even a flea jumping in Russia moves the Earth etc.)</p>

<p>And yes, the sundial time can be up to 16 minutes away from mean solar time (the equation of time), easily noticeable, but if you wanted correct local clock time instead of correct sundial time then you could put as many dates as needed on another dial and rotate the hour scale until the arrows point at the current time of year. The shadow then shows mean solar time.</p>

<p>That should be close enough to mean solar time that you wouldn't care for a number of centuries, certainly a century if you're real picky. As for clock time, what sundial disagreements are possible is limited only by the whims of man. The sundial is several hours wrong in West China. Cause they use the zone that's good for Shanghai (or Tokyo when daylight savings).</p>

<p>And all sundials without moving parts are latitude specific. Some are adjustible, though. Some designs are more suited for some latitudes or even become impossible in some places, like the kind with a wedge or rod on a level face. They will also not work on days with polar night. Though you could use a moondial if it's also not polar moon's below the horizon for days or weeks. Yes, moondials exist! You need to correct for moon phase and time of year or they're useless.</p>

"Galaxy rotation curve and dark matter","383","","<p>I am reading ""The Essential Cosmic Perspective"" by Jeffrey O. Bennett, Megan O. Donahue, Nicholas Schneider, Mark Voit.
In Chapter 14, it is stated that an evidence of the presence of dark matter in our galaxy is that the rotational curve does not match that obtained from calculation.
In the calculation, the following formula is used
$$M_r=\frac{rv^2}{G}$$
where $M_r$ is the mass enclosed inside a radius $r$ from the galactic center.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the above equation is a result of the shell theorem. But we know that shell theorem applies to spherically symmetric mass distribution only, and most galaxies are disks. So why can we still do this?</p>
","<p>We can't. That is an over simplification only used in elementary treatments simply to provide the the flavour of the argument. If you see it done somewhere in the refereed literature, it is probably incorrect. Of course it may be true that the mass is almost spherically symmetric, especially if it is dominated by a spherically symmetric dark matter component, but that the visible light is not. Or, it may be true that at large distances from even an asymmetric mass distribution, a Keplerian potential is a good approximation for the orbits of distant objects (e.g. satellite galaxies to the Milky Way). A measured galaxy rotation curve makes no such assumption, it is merely a measurement of rotation speed as a function of radius. It is only the interpretation and modelling that needs to deal with the mass distribution. </p>

<p>The real situation is much more complex. See for example <a href=""http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Battaner/revision.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Battaner/revision.html</a></p>

<p>However, even if one assumed all the mass was concentrated into a disk-like shape, the only way you can get flat rotation curves is to assume that the mass in the disk does not ""follow the light"" - that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases vastly with radius - which is essentially still saying that you have ""dark matter"", just in a disk.</p>

So, putting the historical question of whether or not he did aside, what plausible answers are there to the question of how he <em>could/would</em> have made such a prediction?</p>
","<p>I recently read the relevant parts of the Cambridge Concise History of Astronomy and I'd suggest it was partly good observation, partly luck.</p>

<p>Good observation in that Thales would have noted that the movements of the Sun and Moon were such that eclipses were possible on certain dates, and luck in that the shadow of the eclipse he suggested was possible passed over him or those to whom he had suggested the eclipse took place.</p>

<p>I very much doubt he had the observational data (about the size of the Earth for instance) to have been precise about the shadow path - but would have had the data to show when the Sun and Moon were in alignment.</p>

"Why does it make sense to say the universe has no centre?","383","","<p>If we suppose we and everything in the universe is perfectly flat.  That is, we have width and depth, but no height.  And we are situated on the surface of a balloon blowing up with air and expanding ""outwards"".  Us flat people can move around on the surface of our balloon but not through it, in much the same way we navigate around the earth, in a plane say. No matter where something is situated on the surface of the balloon, one point is no more central than any other point.  In other words, the surface of a balloon (the ""universe"") has no centre.  Is this why we say it makes no sense to say the universe has a centre, or edge for that matter, or is this analogy stupid?</p>
","<p>The answer to this question lies in cosmology.</p>

<p>It's because of relativity in positions.  Every galaxy appears to be moving away from us and the universe we see is only the observable universe.  Further points are more in the distant past, when you observe the deep field you observe the past.  This may seem irrelevant to your question, but the idea of a ""center"" to a universe where any position in the universe, be it from our galaxy or from a galaxy in the Sloan Great Wall is the true center is not consistent with observation.  That's because galaxies/clusters of galaxies are moving away from each other, relative to each other.  </p>

<p>Every galaxy is slowly being pulled apart from other galaxies, save for those in gravitationally bounded clusters.  (The whole architecture of the universe, with massive voids of absolute nothing and bunched up clusters of galaxies reflects this quite a bit)  If the universe had a central point, this would be easily observed because there would be variation in the color shift of galaxies that could be analyzed to deduce a central point where the galaxies are moving away from.</p>

<p>That is not what is observed.  Instead, pretty much most galaxies (save for exceptions like Andromeda or the Triangulum, who prove the rule since those galaxies are gravitationally connected to our galaxy via the local group) are moving away from us.  The Great attractor being not a path to the center of the universe, but the center of the recently discovered Laniakea super cluster.  So if there's attraction between galaxies, it's because of gravitational interactions.  The universe is also without any real edge unless you count the edge of the observable universe.  The observable universe being more a historical record than what the contemporary universe around us looks like and is a byproduct of light speed being so limited.  The speed of light in a vacuum is also the speed of information.  The whole universe is far more massive by comparison.</p>

<p>So to speak about a center of the universe would require the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A region of space that galaxy is moving away from or towards. (Which does not exist, instead relative trajectories and gravitational clustering is all regional at most.)</p></li>
<li><p>Edges that are defined enough to pinpoint a center (If such edges exist, they are impossible to observe due to the limited speed information travels in the universe)</p></li>
<li><p>Absolute positioning to pinpoint where this center would be. (All positions are relative, the galaxy, the sun and our planet all are moving at extremely fast velocities we don't notice thanks to relativity.)</p></li>

This was particularly surprising, because half of all visible stars are believe to be in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star"">binary systems</a>, which would make planetary systems very unstable, but some binary systems have been <a href=""http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2014/oct/31/planet-forming-stream-found-in-binary-star-system"">found to have planets</a> too.</p>

"Is it possible that Mercury was originally the moon of Venus after a giant impact?","382","","<p>Mercury looks like the Moon, and so it makes me think about a question: is it possible that Venus and Mercury were the a same planet originally, and a giant impact with that planet made it split into Mercury and Venus (like with the Moon and Earth)?</p>
","<p>This was originally going to be a comment, but it ran too long, so I'm making it an answer.</p>

<p>Some models argue that the scenario of a satellite of Venus escaping like this is unlikely. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006DPS....38.0703A"">Alemi &amp; Stevenson (2006)</a> have explored the possibility of a prior Venusian moon, starting from the assumption that Venus would not have been able to avoid a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis"">giant impact</a>. Here's their sequence of events:</p>

<ol>
<li>A large body collides with Venus in a similar manner to the proposed Earth-Theia collision.</li>
<li>Debris from the impact moves outwards into a disk surrounding Venus,</li>
<li>A moon coalesces from the disk, and begins to slowly recede because of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration"">tidal acceleration</a>.</li>
<li>Another large body hits Venus. It reduces Venus's angular momentum, reversing its rotation.</li>
<li>The moon spirals into Venus as it undergoes tidal deceleration, finally colliding with it again.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the tricky things about testing this model is that the authors say that there would not necessarily have been drastic composition changes, meaning that it would be hard to analyze the planet's surface and see if there is evidence supporting the double impact hypothesis. So far, there have not been tests.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that Venus could have suffered other impacts - the model does not preclude that. There are a couple problems with Mercury arising from such a collision:</p>

<ul>
<li>Other impacts could have ended up with the same result as the original moon.</li>
<li>The chances of many more impacts aren't too high.</li>
<li>Solar tides would likely have destabilized the orbit of any moon larger than a few kilometers in diameter (see <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2781"">Sheppard &amp; Trujillo (2009)</a>).</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER""><em>MESSENGER</em></a> determined that <a href=""http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/soc/highlights122011.php"">Mercury has a high potassium/thorium ratio</a> on its surface, which would seem to disprove any events involving extremely high temperatures, including any giant impact variant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, if we accept that Venus could have captured a moon, only the third objection remains - still a strong point against the survival of a satellite, even by itself.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Do rogue planets rotate around their axes?</p>

<p>If they are in motion, and they outnumber the stars in our galaxy, why our solar system never had a guest?</p>
","<p>1) this question has no real answer as it depends on the reference frame being used. It is very unlikely that they will be stationary except in their own reference frame. </p>

<p>rephrased 1) In theory their paths can be calculated precisely if you know their speed and the positions and motions of all other bodies (also gas and dust clouds) that might influence their motion. Practically, you will not have that knowledge, as most non-stellar bodies that the rogue planet may encounter will be very dim and you will not be able to detect them. On the other hand space is for the most part empty, so you might reasonably expect their paths to be quite predictable (within a limited time frame). They'll probably be in orbit (either an elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic) around the centre of the milky way. </p>

<p>2) yes, they will probably have some angular momentum left from where they formed. </p>

<p>Space is very large so it is not very likely that one will appear in our solar system in our lifetime. And of course we do not know if none ever moved through the solar system. </p>

"Why do we believe that the super massive black holes at the centers of two merging galaxies would themselves merge?","380","","<p>When listening to podcasts or watching youtube videos of astronomers discussing galaxy mergers, I often hear talk about how the super massive black holes at their centers will themselves merge during or shortly after the collision. Why do we believe this to be the case?</p>

<p>A priori, I would expect SMBH's to behave the same as all other galactic objects. They might be extraordinarily massive, but physically they are still minuscule compared to the vast empty space between stars in a galaxy. Collisions between objects (not counting gigantic clouds of gas and dust) would be extraordinarily rare, so why do we make an exception for the SMBH's?</p>

<p>I could see a case for them merging in the (rare?) instance where the host galaxies hit each other in such a way that the mutual center of mass happens to coincide with their individual centers of mass. In that case, the SMBH's could be close enough to orbit about one another, losing energy to gravitational waves and eventually merging. I would think that this scenario is rather rare, however. I find it more plausible that an average galaxy merger would leave the SMBH's independently orbiting the center of the combined galaxy, too far apart to lose any significant kinetic energy to gravitational waves.</p>

<p>The astronomers who talk about galactic mergers know a heck of a lot more than I do about the subject, so I presume there are flaws in my assumptions or my understanding of the physics. What am I missing?</p>
","<p>The SMBHs reside in the bottom of the galactic potentials, which are dominated by the galaxies' dark matter halos. But although dark matter dominates gravity, collisions between gas and dust particles in the interstellar medium causes enough friction that the baryonic component of the galaxies is decelerated. This will cause the other components of the galaxies to decelerate as well, through gravitational attraction.</p>

<p>Moreover, despite dark matter (and, in practice, stars and black holes since they're so small) being collisionless, there are several ways of ""relaxing"", i.e. to evolve towards an equilibrium. In the context of galaxy merging, the most important mechanism (I think) is ""violent relaxation"", where the rapid change of the gravitational potential causes particles to relax, e.g. more massive particles tend to transfer more energy to their lighter neighbors and so become more tightly bound, sinking towards the center of the gravitational potential.</p>

<p>Although SMBHs are…, well, supermassive, the potential will (usually) be dominated by dark matter, gas, and stars, so the new gravitational potential will also cause the SMBHs to seek towards the bottom in the same fashion, and eventually merge.</p>

<p>That is a very old document you are using. It's using the 1982 IAU precession model. There have been multiple updates since then. The latest set of changes are working toward eliminating the concept of Greenwich Sidereal Time. (In software terms, GMST and GAST are deprecated concepts. While still currently supported, support will be dropped in some future release of the Earth rotation model.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Other than using an outdated version of a deprecated concept, what did you do wrong? The expression you are using to compute GMST is at the top of page A-26:
$$\Lambda = H_0 + \Delta H + \omega^{\ast}\,(t-\Delta t)$$
The $\Delta H$ term takes one from GMST to GAST. Dropping that term, the expression for GMST is
$$H = H_0 + \omega^{\ast}\,(t-\Delta t)\tag1$$
where
$$\begin{align}
H_0 = &amp;\,24110.54841 + 8640184.812866 T_u + 0.093104 {T_u}^2 - 6.2\times10^{-6} {T_u}^3\tag 2 \\
&amp;\,\text{is the Greenwich sidereal time at midnight, in seconds of time} \\
\omega^{\ast} = &amp;\,7.2921158553\times10^{-5} + 4.3\times10^{-15} T_u\tag3 \\
&amp;\,\text{is the Earth's sidereal rotation rate, in radians}/\text{second} \\
t\phantom{\Delta}\quad&amp;\text{is UTC time of day, in seconds, and} \\
\Delta t\quad&amp;\text{is the difference between UT1 and UTC.}
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Note that there's a units mismatch in equation (1). Equation (2) yields a result in units of sidereal seconds while equation (3), when multiplied by time of day, yields a result in units of radians. The latter needs to be converted to sidereal seconds. To do this, simply multiple both terms in equation (3) by $\frac{86400}{2\pi}$:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\omega^{\ast} = &amp;\,1.00273790935 + 5.9\times10^{-11} T_u\tag4 \\
&amp;\,\text{is the Earth's sidereal rotation rate, in sidereal seconds}/\text{UT second}
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Applying this to 2019 Jan 01 08:00:00 UTC yields the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Julian date at midnight UTC 2019 Jan 01 is $2458484.5$, or $2451545+6939.5$. See footnote 1 for an explanation of this convention.</li>
<li>Dividing the residual 6939.5 by 36525 yields $T_u$: $T_u = 6939.5 / 36525 = 0.1899931553730322$.</li>
<li>Applying equation (2) yields the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time at midnight: $H_0 = 1665686.527373333$ sidereal seconds.</li>
<li>Applying equation (4) and multiplying by $t=8*3600$ seconds yields another 28878.85178960284 sidereal seconds to the above. What about $\Delta t$, aka dUT1? I've ignored it (i.e., treated it as if it was zero.) See footnote 2.</li>
<li>1665686.527373333 + 28878.85178960284 = 52965.37916293584 (modulo 86400). This is the mean sidereal time, in seconds. Converting to hours, minutes and seconds results in 14:42:45.4. The 0.4 seconds is bogus because I ignored dUT1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Footnotes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There's a problem with using Julian dates to express time when high precision is of concern. The problem is that adding 2.45 million and change to the time since noon on 1 Jan 2000 results in potential truncation problems. The next representable Julian date after midnight 1 Jan 2000 is 40 microseconds after midnight. I myself try to stay a couple of orders of magnitude away from the quantization level, which means problems for dates at the millisecond level.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
  
  <p>It is widely accepted that black holes with masses greater than a million solar masses (M⊙) lurk at the centres of massive galaxies. The origins of such ‘supermassive’ black holes(SMBHs) remain unknown, although those of stellar-mass black holes are well understood. One possible scenario is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), which are formed by the runaway coalescence of stars in young compact star clusters merge at the centre of a galaxy to form a SMBH. Although many candidates for IMBHs have been proposed, none is accepted as definitive. Recently, we discovered a peculiar molecular cloud, CO–0.40–0.22, with an extremely broad velocity width, near the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. Based on the careful analysis of gas kinematics, we concluded that a compact object with a mass of about 105 M⊙ is lurking in this cloud. Here we report the detection of a point-like continuum source as well as a compact gas clump near the
  centre of CO–0.40–0.22. This point-like continuum source (CO–0.40–0.22*) has a wide-band spectrum consistent with 1/500 of the Galactic SMBH (Sgr A*) in luminosity. Numerical simulations around a point-like massive object reproduce the kinematics of dense molecular gas well, which suggests that CO–0.40–0.22* is one of the most promising candidates for an intermediate-mass black hole.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>An earlier paper on the object (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04661"" rel=""noreferrer"">Oka et al. (2015)</a>) explains that CO-0.40-0.22 is a ""high-velocity compact cloud"". The first discovery of such an object was two decades ago (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9810434"" rel=""noreferrer"">Oka et al. (1998)</a>), when CO 0.02-0.02 was found. The naming convention used for that object was</p>

<pre><code>""CO"" + Galactic longitude + Galactic latitude
</code></pre>

<p>For instance, CO 0.02-0.02 has latitude $0.02^{\circ}$ and longitude $-0.02^{\circ}$; CO-0.40-0.22 has latitude $-0.40^{\circ}$ and longitude $-0.22^{\circ}$. Naming based on coordinates is <a href=""https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Andernach/Ander3.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">used for many other radio sources</a>.</p>

<p>The * in the name of the continuum point source is, I believe, in continuation of the tradition set by the discovery of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sagittarius A*</a>, the point source in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sagittarius A</a>. It is often necessary to distinguish between the two. Quoting from <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0305074"" rel=""noreferrer"">Goss et al. (2003)</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eight years after the discovery, one of us (Brown) invented the name Sgr A* to distinguish the compact source from the other components in the galactic center and to emphasize the unique nature of this source. Brown (1982) proposed a model of Sgr A* consisting of twin precessing jets with a period of 2300 years. The model has not stood the test of time but the name immediately was accepted. As an example, the VLBI results discussed by Lo et al. (1985) uses the name Sgr A*; the review article by Lo (1987) also uses this nomenclature.</p>
  
  <p>Bob Brown provides the following rationale for the name: “ Scratching on a yellow pad one morning I tried a lot of possible names. When I began thinking of the radio source as the “exciting source” for the cluster of H II regions seen in the VLA maps, the name Sgr A* occurred to me by analogy brought to mind by my Phd dissertation, which is in atomic physics and where the nomenclature for excited state atoms is He*, or Fe* etc.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The difference between CO-0.40-0.22 and CO-0.40-0.22* is simple: The former is a high-velocity compact cloud, and the latter is a point radio source inside it, possibly an intermediate-mass black hole. The formation, evolution and interactions of the two are likely tied together, but, as with Sagittarius A and Sagittarius A*, they need to be distinguished.</p>

"How accurate are NASA's eclipse predictions?","374","","<p>NASA's predictions for the August 2017 solar eclipse show that about half of Kansas City will see a total eclipse and the other half won't (they'll just see a ""near"" total eclipse, perhaps even Bailey's Beads?).</p>

<p>I thought this would be a great way of testing how accurate NASA's eclipse path prediction is: have people in Kansas City report, with location, whether they saw a total eclipse or not (of course, many people in Kansas City will probably head into the total eclipse zone just to see it, but hopefully few will remain outside it).</p>

<p>It then occurred to me that someone must've already done this for previous eclipses (I know it's done for lunar occultations of other stars).</p>

<p>However, googling only tells me that NASA's 2017 path predictions are more accurate than ever before, but not actually HOW accurate they are.</p>

<p>Where can I find data about accuracy of eclipse predictions?</p>
","<p>The path of totality, which eclipse maps show to be 70 miles wide, is actually narrower than that, by up to 1 mile, according to some experts.</p>

<p>An <a href=""http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article166394247.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> by the Kansas City Star discusses this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those maps, provided by NASA and others, show a crisply defined, 70-mile-wide path of totality where the moon will block 100 percent of the sun. But they are not as precise as they appear, at least on their edges.</p>
  
  <p>The southern edge of the path as shown on the maps could be off by as little as the length of a football field or as much as a half-mile, eclipse mapping experts say. Likewise for the northern edge, meaning the path of totality might be just 69 miles wide.</p>
  
  <p>“This is an issue. This is really an issue, but it’s not advertised. … Yeah, all the maps are wrong,” Mike Kentrianakis, who is the solar eclipse project manager for the American Astronomical Society and who routinely consults with NASA, told The Star.</p>
  
  <p>Xavier Jubier, a French engineer whose calculations have been used to create the interactive Google maps of the eclipse, confirmed to The Star by email that the actual path of the totality is slightly narrower than the 70 miles shown on current maps.</p>
  
  <p>Ernest Wright, who created maps and other multimedia presentations on the eclipse for NASA, said he thought the map might be narrower by about 100 meters, slightly longer than a football field. He also said it’s possible that Kentrianakis is correct in his estimation that the path is narrower by a half-mile or more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article explains the reason the path of totality is narrower than the eclipse maps indicate is because they use a 41-year old value for the radius of the Sun, which is now known to be too small a value:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wright explained that eclipse maps are made based on what is known about the relative sizes and positions of the moon and the sun. “We have really good information about the orbit of the moon, the positions of the sun, the positions of the Earth. All of that is really well nailed down,” Wright said. “In order to get more accuracy, we need to take into account the mountains and valleys on the moon, and the elevations on the Earth. And we’re starting to do that, as well.”</p>
  
  <p>The size of the moon, in fact, has been measured to within a meter, and its position in the heavens has been measured to within a centimeter. “But the last sort of uncertainty might surprise you,” Wright said. “It’s the size of the sun.”</p>
  
  <p>Jubier said that the current maps are accurate using the the 696,000-kilometer radius and other standards agreed upon in 1976 at a meeting of the International Astronomical Union. “This is perfectly accurate but we know it does use a solar diameter that is not large enough. Why don’t we change the value(?)” Jubier wrote. “Well simply because the IAU (International Astronomical Union) has not yet approved a new value. This is part of the research we’re doing and for which we’re looking for funding.”</p>
  
  <p>He continued, “So technically speaking if the Sun is larger than the adopted IAU value, and we know it is, the eclipse path is necessarily narrower and our tools can simulate this, yet the standard maps for the public will still retain the currently adopted solar radius until a new value has been accepted.""</p>

<p>If galaxies were uniformly distributed, and the HUDF were representative of the entire sky, that would mean there were approximately 130 billion galaxies, which falls between estimates I have read of between 100 and 200 billion as the total number of galaxies.</p>

<p>However, my understanding is that galaxies occur in clusters, which would seem to imply that some areas of the sky should be more densely populated than others.</p>

<p>So is the HUDF representative of the entire sky, or are some areas much more and much less densely populated?</p>
","<p>Short answer: both.</p>

<p>HUDF is representative on the type of galaxies we can find at that distance (and remember that distance also means time ago).</p>

<p>On the other hand, we do not really <em>know</em> how the galaxies are grouped beyond certain level, but we <em>think</em> they are grouped on so-called filaments, leaving enormous empty voids.</p>

","<p>Pretty much by definition, <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<p>In order for ""object A"" to orbit ""object B"", ""object B"" needs to be substantially more massive than ""object A"".  In order for your red dwarf to orbit something, that ""something"" needs to be more massive than a red dwarf.  With the current composition of the universe, that ""something"" will be mostly hydrogen, and once you reach a certain level of mass (about 90 times that of Jupiter), you can't prevent nuclear fusion from starting.

Does anybody know a reference that has this value?  And if it makes a difference, I would like to know the density for quiescent helium burning, not helium flash helium burning.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/highmass.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this webpage</a>, I have a few statistics regarding required mean density and during each phase of fusion (the fusion of lighter elements may happen in the ""shells"" outside the core).
$$\begin{array}{|c|c|}

This is data for a star of $25M_{\odot}$.</p>

<p>Note, however, that this is <em>mean</em> density in the star, <em>not</em> the density in the core, where fusion is taking place.

"Red Moon a Characteristic of all Total Lunar Eclipses?","371","","<p>I understand that the redness of the moon during the total lunar eclipse last night/this morning (April 14-15 2014) is a reflection of the red light caused in earth's atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering (basically, a reflection of all the sunsets and sunrises happening around the earth).  Because of this, it seems to me that the moon will appear red during every total lunar eclipse that happens.  Is this the case, or are there some lunar eclipses where the moon does not turn red?  If it is the case that all total lunar eclipses produce a red moon, why was the media so hyped up about last night's eclipse producing a red moon?  Was it especially red?</p>
","<p>No, not all total lunar eclipses will turn the Moon deep red. Most of them do, but not all.</p>

<p>If you were standing on the Moon during the eclipse, you'd see the Earth passing in front of, and obscuring, the Sun. But the Earth will never become fully dark, even when the Sun is fully covered. A bright ring will always surround the Earth. Why?</p>

<p>That ring is sunlight refracted by the atmosphere. It's there because the Earth has an atmosphere. You could say it's all the sunrises and sunsets of the Earth, all seen at once. It's this light that continues to illumine the Moon during the eclipse.</p>

<p>But why is the Moon red, instead of some other color? This is because the blue end of the spectrum is scattered more easily in all directions (same mechanism that explains why the sky is blue on Earth), whereas the red part of the spectrum is scattered less easily and moves on a straighter path along the refraction lines. The bright ring around the Earth, as seen from the Moon, is probably red, because most of the blue in it has been scattered away.</p>

<p>Now, if the Earth's atmosphere is full of dust particles from huge volcanic eruptions, the bright ring is a lot weaker. That makes the Moon during the eclipse a much darker shade of red. Sometimes the Moon is a very dark, dull grey during the eclipse, no red hue at all - so dark in fact that it's hard to see in the sky while the eclipse is full. This has happened some decades ago after the Pinatubo eruption.</p>

<p>As you can see, the magnitude varies quite a bit.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: each eclipse is a bit different. A majority would have some kind of orange, copper or red tint. A minority are too dark to see any color. Unusual colors (outside of the red-yellow interval) are very rarely possible. Brightness and hue varies from one instance to another, since it depends on Earth's atmosphere, which is a system that changes greatly over time.</p>

"Sky Glow calculations","371","","<p>I am leading a project for my High School NASA Club, and am looking for some advice. The goal of our project is to use a Raspberry Pi to control a camera that takes photos of the sky, and uses the photo to calculate sky glow, and create a map of where it in the sky is there the most sky glow. After calculating sky glow the device would add it to a plot that shows how sky glow varies throughout the year, and creates a nightly twitter post rating the night for Astronomy. I currently have working code that when given a picture, it will convert down to greyscale, and then find the brightness map, and find an average sky glow. The part that I am stuck on is in figuring out what kind of camera to use. I don't know if the RPi camera module would work for taking photos of the stars, or if I would be better suited using a USB webcam with it. I am not sure what factors are important in this decision at all. Also, once the camera is set up, what would be the best process for calibrating it to get values that agree most closely with accepted ones? I couldn't decide if this should go on the Astronomy, Raspberry Pi, or Photography Stack Exchange, but I chose this one since sky glow may be something astronomers calculate a lot. Thank you for your help.</p>
","<p>Well, light, and the resulting sky glow comes in a lot of different wavelengths, so the first question you need to ask yourself is what range are you looking for?  If this project is intended to give someone a good idea as to whether it is worth their while to drag out the telescope on a given night, chances are you only care about human visible wavelengths (but don't underestimate the amateur radio astronomers in your area!).  My phone's camera will pick up light in the near-infrared, so you want to be careful.</p>

<p>Secondly, you need a camera with very low noise.  If you go into a windowless room with the lights off, and take a picture, you want to have as close to 0x000000 rgb measurement from every resulting pixel as possible.  A magnitude 0 star will only produce 2.08 microlux, so electrical noise can alter your results significantly.</p>

<p>Third, and this may be obvious, make yourself a cardboard ""horizon shield"" (a name I made up) to block any direct sources of light.</p>

<p>And if it isn't of vital importance to use an actual camera, since you are using a raspberry pi, you might just want to go with a lux meter instead. <a href=""https://www.modmypi.com/adafruit-digital-luminosity-sensor"" rel=""nofollow"">This one</a> has a separate meter for the human visible wavelength, and the noise should be very low, depending upon how you wire it and what voltage you supply.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the nature of this fluctuation, I did a quick analysis: read 10 bias frames, then iterated through them, subtracting each frame from the median combination of all other frames.

<p>All of the noise frames have near-perfect gaussian distributions with pretty much constant FWHM, it's just the central value that shifts around with each frame.</p>

<p>This leads me to a couple of conclusions: firstly, this shift truely is a shift in median value and not just a result of something like cosmic rays; secondly, the fluctuation is an additive effect and so not due to a change in gain due to a difference in voltage or something like that.</p>

<p>This is normally several columns of ""pixels"" that appear appended to each row of your data, but which do not correspond to physical pixels on the CCD. They are actually dummy readouts to assess the actual bias level in each particular row.</p>

<p>The overscan region should be clearly visible in any real exposure of a light source, since the overscan region will be un-illuminated.</p>

<p>You can use the overscan in two ways. The conventional method is to overscan-correct your images <em>before</em> doing a bias subtraction. You should also do this to your bias frames <em>before</em> combining them into your ""master bias"" frame.</p>

<p>So, take your overscan region and either (i) calculate a median (or clipped mean) within it and subtract this value from every pixel in the image before use (including the bias frames); or (ii) fit something more complicated as a function of row number and then subtract this from your actual data on a row-by-row basis.</p>

","<p>To answer the main part of your question: Yes, there do exist such systems. They're called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_binary"" rel=""nofollow"">visual binaries</a>.

<p>No, there aren't. You were right when you said that the definition of a binary system is basically two stars orbiting a common center of mass. If the stars don't orbit each other, they aren't a binary system.</p>

<p>By the way, check out <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri"" rel=""nofollow"">Proxima Centauri</a>, the nearest star to the Sun.

<hr>

<p>Let me address something that Mitch pointed out. The classification of star systems as ""visual binaries"" is based solely on our ability to observe them. If we had better telescope, this class could change. An analogy might be our naming certain wavelengths of light ""visible"". They only depend on our perceptions, not some objective characteristic that all observers in the universe could agree on.</p>

"Could someone see anything while being inside black hole?","368","","<p>If we managed to survive in a black hole and move inside the event horizon then could we see the surroundings of the black hole inside the event horizon by source of light? Can the light not come up to the event horizon or does it have to travel through different spheres of the black hole and enter a sphere which won't allow the light to return to its previous sphere? If the we reach up to the singularity then can we ever reach up to the event horizon or would we get stuck in the point of the singularity?</p>
","<p>The answer is most definitely yes, or at least yes, as far as our current understanding of how gravity works goes. It is observationally untestable (let's be more specific - nobody could report the results of an observational test!) since no signal can emerge from inside the event horizon.</p>

<p>The scenario is treated in some detail by Taylor &amp; Wheeler (""Exploring Black Holes"", Addison, Wesley, Longman - highly recommended) in terms of what an observer would see on a direct radial trajectory into a non-rotating ""Schwarzschild"" black hole. I won't bore you with the maths - it is fairly complex.</p>

<p>A star situated at <em>exactly</em> 180 degrees from the observer's radial path will always appear in that position as the observer looks back - right down to the singularity. The light will be gravitationally <em>blueshifted</em> by an ever-increasing amount - essentially tending towards an infinite blueshift at the singularity.</p>

<p>For stars at an angle to the radial path, their positions will be distorted such that they appear to move away from the point at which the observer has come from (and are also blue-shifted). In the final moments (it takes less than $1.5\times 10^{-4}$ seconds of proper time to fall from the event horizon to the singularity of a 10 solar mass black hole, but a huge $\sim 60$ seconds for the black hole at the centre of our Galaxy) the light from the external universe will flatten into an intense ring at 90 degrees to the radial direction of motion. So you would end up seeing blackness in front of you, blackness behind and the sky split in two by a dazzling ring of light (almost seems worth it!).</p>

<p>Gamma Ray Bursts are a short lived. While a quasar will emit more energy over it's long life. Gamma Ray Bursts are more powerful. They are formed mostly as a result of energy released in gravitational collapse during a hypernova. Moreover this energy is released in a narrow beam. </p>

"Would a tablespoon of a neutron star remain intact?","366","","<p>I've heard people say that a tablespoon of neutron star would weigh over a billion tons. If we ever <em>could</em> take a tablespoon of one would it still remain intact with the same density? </p>
","<p>If we take neutron star material and somehow transport it somewhere for examination (say the Earth!), the results would be catastrophic. At say a density of $\sim 10^{17}$ kg/m$^{3}$ the neutrons have a number density of $\sim 6\times 10^{43}$ m$^{-3}$ an internal kinetic energy density of $3 \times 10^{32}$ J/m$^{3}$ (calculated using the relevant equations for an ideal gas of degenerate neutrons at this density). So even in a tablespoonful (say 20ml, which would have a mass of 2 billion tonnes!), there is $6\times10^{27}$ J of kinetic energy (15 times more than the Sun emits in a second, or a few billion atom bombs) and this will be released <strong>instantaneously</strong>.  </p>

<p>The energy is in the form of around $10^{39}$ neutrons travelling at around 0.1-0.2$c$. So roughly speaking it is like half the neutrons (about a billion tonnes) travelling at 0.1$c$ ploughing into the Earth. If I have done my Maths right, that is roughly equivalent to a 50km radius near-earth asteroid hitting the Earth at 30 km/s.</p>

<p>The neutrons in a dense neutron star gas are relatively stable (beta decay is blocked by electron degeneracy). The expansion described above would allow beta decay into protons and electrons, but as this happens on timescales of 10 minutes, it is hardly relevant to the initial destruction. However, you would end up after a few tens of minutes with an expanding cloud of ionised hydrogen a few light minutes across.</p>

<p>The minimum possible size to gravitationally bind neutron star material is thought to be around $0.15 M_{\odot}$ (see <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/143166/what-is-the-theoretical-lower-mass-limit-for-a-gravitationally-stable-neutron-st/143174#143174"">here</a>).

Now would there be a difference if I distanced myself from the surface by any amount?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What id like to know, in what distance do they have to be from each other to create only one gravitational influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At whichever point you decide to call them two objects rather than one object. It's a completely arbitrary choice that depends on you rather than gravitational physics. What's going on is that gravity can be described by a mass density distribution, and which part of that distribution corresponds to ""one object"" and which to ""another object"" isn't important.</p>

<p>You may be confused by Newton's law of gravity that says the gravitational force force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them squared. But this law only applies to spherically symmetric objects. It only applies to you exactly if you're a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow"" rel=""nofollow"">spherical cow</a>.</p>

<p>This kind of arbitrariness actually applies to the Earth as well. Even if the Earth were perfectly spherically symmetric, one could say that Earth's gravity is due to the influence of the northern hemisphere <em>and</em> the influence of the southern hemisphere, etc. Whether you consider the Earth to be one object, or two, or a trillion, depends on you.</p>

<p>The Earth isn't spherically symmetric. It's closer to an oblate spheroid, since it bulges at the equator. But it isn't exactly that either, having mountains or other topographical feature, to say nothing of mass density variations <em>inside</em> the Earth. In principle, one could describe its gravity <em>including</em> people and trees or whatnot. Gravitationally, there is no fundamental difference between you and some rock. That you consider yourself to not be ""part of Earth"" is a choice you make for other reasons.</p>

<p>If you distance yourself from the Earth, there is a difference because the mass distribution would change. But again, whether you consider this to be ""only one gravitational influence"" or ""the Earth plus you"" is up to you, and this holds true <em>regardless</em> of whether you distanced yourself or not.</p>

<p>How much the research community is using photometers today? I looked up the prices of some photometers from <a href=""http://telescopes.net/store/telescope-accessories/photometers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. The device, filters, etc. can cost nearly $2500. One could get a good CCD camera with that price.</p>

<p>What are some applications where the good time resolution (apparently around 1 ms) would be needed? Are photometers equally useful with small telescopes (e.g. 8-inch) as CCDs?</p>
","<p>You have correctly identified a niche for photometers. Another point in their favour used to be that they were much more sensitive in the U-band than CCDs, but I think that newer CCDs can almost match or surpass the U-band response of photometers.</p>

<p>CCDs take quite a time to readout. The faster you read them out, generally speaking, the higher the readout noise. By comparison, the output from photometers can be very fast indeed with little impact on the noise characteristics. One of the beauties of photometers is also that they give you an instant readout of how many photons have been detected, requiring little analysis to provide real-time monitoring of signals.</p>

<p>However, things move on. So now there <em>are</em> CCD instruments that can work on extremely fast timescales. The primary example of this is a UK-built and operated instrument called <a href=""http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/ultracam/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">ULTRACAM</a>, which allows data-taking at 100 Hz and which uses a special ""drift"" mode of readout to achieve this.</p>

<p>Back to your main question - what are the scientific objectives of such instruments? On the link I provided above you will see a series of press releases that describe some of the science. These range from measuring the transits of Trans-Neptunian-Objects in front of background stars; examining detailed time series of flares on magnetic stars; investigating the eclipses caused by white dwarfs passing in front of companion stars; looking at the flickering output from accreting black holes; attempting to get phase resolved light curves of the optical emission from rapidly rotating pulsars and much more.</p>

<p>A rule of thumb is, that if you are able to obtain a time resolution $\Delta t$, then you are probing size scales of $\leq c \Delta t$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Thus if you can get a resolution of 0.01s, this corresponds to size scales of $\leq 3000$ km.</p>

<p>As to whether a photometer would be good on an 8-inch telescope, I'm not sure. When I was a student I used a photoelectric photometer on a small telescope to (i) study the scintillation of stars as a probe of conditions in the upper atmosphere - e.g. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1985AN....306..145S"" rel=""nofollow"">Stecklum (1985)</a> - which has timescales of order $0.01-1$ seconds.

<p>So, suppose I'm standing next to, but safely away from, some train tracks.  As the train approaches, sounding its whistle constantly, the pitch will appear to increase until it reaches me, upon which I will briefly hear the whistle's 'rest pitch' (the pitch of the whistle as if I were aboard the train), then it would decrease as the train moves away.  Thus, the lower the pitch, the further away the train is.  I hope that's right.  So, if we know the rest frequency of galaxy GN-z11, its measured frequency indicates how far away it is from earth. Trouble is, how do we know what the rest frequency of light coming from this distant galaxy is?   </p>
","<p>So GN z-11 is the latest ""furthest away"" galaxy. It has a claimed redshift measurement of $z=11.1$, meaning that we are seeing the light it emitted about 400 Myr after the big bang (dependent on an assumed set of cosmological parameters).</p>

<p>To get the redshift measurement, the discoverers used grism (relatively low resolution) spectroscopy in the near infrared. What they were looking for is the rest-frame Lyman alpha continuum break, which would be redshifted into this wavelength range.</p>

<p>The Lyman alpha continuum break is caused by the absorption of nearly all ultraviolet photons with wavelengths smaller than 121 nm. These high energy photons are capable of photoionising the neutral hydrogen present in the intergalactic medium at a range of lower redshifts. This neutral hydrogen is present in abundance at redshifts greater than 6, as it had not yet been <em>re-ionised</em> by quasars and starlight. The consequence is that no light is expected to reach us from rest-frame wavelengths shortwards of 121 nm, but a galaxy's light <em>can</em> reach us from rest-frame wavelengths that are longer than this. When one <em>observes</em> the spectrum, we see flux at long wavelengths which suddenly cuts off at shorter wavelengths. The wavelength of the break is $\lambda = 121 \times (1+z)$ nm, where $z$ is the redshift.</p>

<p>It is this Lyman alpha continuum break that has been identified at an observed wavelength of 1470 nm. This leads to the redshift estimate of $z= (1470/121)-1 = 11.1$.</p>

<p>The details are presented in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00461"">Oesch et al. (2016)</a>. The continuum break is the only thing visible in the spectrum. The authors are confident that this is what it is because their previous broadband photometry had given them an estimated redshift of $&gt;10$ (which is why they observed this candidate in the first place).</p>

"Is radiation from neutron stars delayed by time dilation?","360","","<p>I understand a neutron star to be the densest stuff that can exist without becoming a black hole, the densest thing which directly gives off radiation we can detect. At the event horizon of a black hole, time stands still, in our frame of reference.</p>

<p>Does there exist neutron stars which are very close to getting an event horizon?</p>

<p>Does this ""neutron star horizon"" cause time dilation, a zone from within of which movement is very slow in our frame of reference?</p>

<p>Could it for example be that the first light from a neutron star itself reaches us billions of years after the light of the supernova of the ""classical"" star which created the neutron star and its event-horizon like relativistic effects?</p>
","<p>A typical neutron star of $1.5M_{\odot}$ is thought to have a radius of around 8-10 km. This is only a factor of 2 larger than the Schwarzschild radius for a similar mass black hole.</p>

<p>We know that more massive neutron stars do exist. The current record holder is around $2M_{\odot}$. Most equations of state (the adopted relationship between pressure and density) for dense nuclear matter suggest that more massive neutron stars are smaller and therefore must be even closer in radius to the Schwarzschild radius.</p>

<p>So the premise of you question is basically correct. It is certainly true that when you deal with neutron star spectra you do have to apply significant general relativistic corrections to measured temperatures and the same corrections would need to be applied to any temporal variations.</p>

<p>Thus a time-variable signal from a neutron star surface will appear slower to an observer on Earth.</p>

<p>For the last part, I suspect that the scenario you propose is extremely unlikely. <a href=""http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.32.324"" rel=""nofollow"">Rhoades &amp; Ruffini (1974)</a> first established that there must be a maximum mass for a neutron star under GR conditions, even if we allow the equation of state to harden to the point where the speed of sound is the speed of light. This maximum mass is around $3.2M_{\odot}$.  This sets an upper limit to the possible value of $GM/Rc^{2} \leq 0.405$ (see p.261 of Shapiro &amp; Teukolsky, <em>Black holes, white dwarfs and neutron stars</em>). This in turn sets an upper limit the possible gravitational redshift (and time dilation factor) of 2.29.</p>

<p>Beyond this point the neutron star is unstable and will collapse to become a black hole. In reality the limit is probably a bit tighter than that because most proposed equations of state result in neutron stars becoming unstable at finite densities and at masses quite a bit lower than $3.2M_{\odot}$.</p>

<p>So I think the most time dilation you are ever going to see from a neutron star surface is a factor of $\sim 2$. </p>

","<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5676"" rel=""nofollow"">In 2011, about 20% of the exoplanets found were hot Jupiters</a>. That is a lot, but it is strongly biased simply because there are the easiest planets to detect. You can detect exoplanets by transit (that means that the planet passes in front of its host star which decreases the luminosity of the observed star during the transit), hot Jupiters being closer to their host star and bigger than smaller planets will therefore be easier to detect. You can detect exoplanets by radial velocity, which means that you detect variation of the position of the host star due to planet's gravity. The closer and the heavier the planet is, the larger the variation will be, and therefore the easier to detect.</p>

<p>That's why it is important to say ""In 2011""; as our detection techniques (and telescopes) improve, the proportion of hot Jupiters should decreases.</p>

"Can Earth host another natural satellite than the Moon?","358","","<p>Are there orbits with long-term stability (astronomical time scales) around Earth? Low altitude orbits will decay due to friction with Earth's atmosphere. Inside Earth's Roche limit, a Moon could not form anyway due tidal forces. At altitudes closer to that of the Moon, the Moon would presumably destabilize an orbit such that the object would either collide with Earth or the Moon or be ejected. </p>

<p>Many of the other planets in our solar system have multiple natural satellites; where this occurs, they are always vastly smaller than the primary - think of Jupiter, Saturn, and even Mars. On the other hand Earth, and apparently Pluto, each has only one natural satellite, relatively large in comparison to the primary. Is this because a large satellite will tend to clear the entire ""sphere of influence"" around its primary of any other material?</p>

<p>So my question is: does the existence of our Moon effectively prevent the formation or capture of any other natural satellite around Earth? (Considering only true satellites, not ""companion"" objects or quasi-satellites)</p>
","<p>Short answer:   It might be impossible ""long term"".  It's problematic because of the size of the Moon and the proximity to the Sun.</p>

<p>Long answer:</p>

<p>The Earth-Moon system in empty space could hold several more moons (like the Pluto-Charon system).    The problem is proximity to the sun in addition to the size of the Moon.    Planets closer to their star have a harder time holding onto moons in part cause the Hill sphere is smaller, in part cause the tidal forces are that much bigger (and those 2 factors may go hand in hand, not in addition to).   But it's not just coincidence that Mercury and Venus don't have moons, they're also less likely to hold onto Moons.  </p>

<p>Mars has a smaller Hill Sphere than Earth due to it's lower mass but it's 2 moons are very tiny.  Also, one of Mars 2 moons might not be there that much longer.  It may crash into Mars in as little as 100 million years.</p>

<p>Earth's proximity to the Sun gives the Earth a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hill Sphere</a> of about 1.5 million km, and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere#True_region_of_stability"" rel=""noreferrer"">true region of stability</a> (long term) is about 1/3 to 1/2 of that, so about 500-750,000 km which isn't all that much further out than the Moon is currently.  </p>

<p>Our Moon's average distance is 384,000 km, but our moon has a slightly eccentric orbit so it's distance varies between about 363,100 and 405,700 km.  <a href=""http://www.space.com/18145-how-far-is-the-moon.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source.</a></p>

<p>The 2nd factor is the relative mass between the Moon and the planet.   Mars has 2 moons but it's moons are very small and they have very little gravitational effect on each other.    Our Moon is 1/81st the mass of the Earth which is the largest Moon to planet ratio in our solar-system.</p>

<p>Using the simplified hill sphere formula, the cube root of (the ratio of the masses/3).   Basically the cube root of (1/243) gives Earth's moon's a hill sphere of about 16% it's distance to the Earth.   Any Earth orbiting object that passes within the Moon's hill sphere is obviously not going to be in a stable orbit.   In fact the region of instability probably extends well past that 16%.   How far past, I'm not sure, but I can safely say that anything even remotely close to the Moon's orbit couldn't orbit the Earth for any period of time.  </p>

<p>Using 16%, the clearly unstable region is between 300,000 km and 470,000 KM.   It would be impossible for an object to orbit the Earth at a greater distance than the Moon.   Solar and Lunar perturbations would be too big.   </p>

<p>If it's possible for Earth to have a 2nd moon at all, it would need to orbit quite close to the Earth.   Probably well inside 300,000 KM.  The closer to the Earth the more the Earth's gravitation would be dominant, so if I was to guess, I think the Moon would need to be quite close, maybe in the 50,000 km range - but that's just a guess.   </p>

<p>For comparison, Jupiter's 3 moons in orbital resonance; Ganymede, the largest of the 3 has a hill sphere is about 3% it's distance from Jupiter.   The 1:2:4 orbital resonance works out to the 1.5th root of 2 or about a 1.59 to 1 orbital distance ratio.  Those 3 moons also have very nearly circular orbits.    If the Moon's orbit was nearly circular, there might be a stable resonance 1.59 times closer to the Earth, but because of the Moon's orbit is measurably eccentric, I don't believe the 2:1 orbital period ratio would be long term stable because there's too many wobbles in it.   I think your best bet for a stable orbit for a 2nd moon would be very close to the Earth, probably in the 50-100,000 KM range (but that's a rough guess).</p>

<p>It's worth noting that ""long term stable"" isn't a precise term cause there's no clear cut-off.  A thousand orbits?  A million?   A billion?   Lifespan of the Sun?</p>

<p>I realize that ""maybe, maybe not"" isn't an answer, but I wanted to touch on some of why it's difficult.  A captured satellite couldn't get captured into a relatively circular near earth orbit because the incoming velocity is too great.  In theory, if there was enough debris, a satellite could form close to the Earth and perhaps be stable for relatively long term, but the Moon would to some extent prevent such a formation in a similar way that Jupiter prevents the asteroid belt from coalescing into a tiny planet.   (the low mass of the asteroid belt plays a role in that too, perhaps a bigger role), but Jupiter is a factor. <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/112464/why-isnt-the-asteroid-belt-a-planet/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Article here</a></p>

"Can the theory of multiverse explain dark matter?","356","","<p>If there are many universes, they must have a gravity effect on each other. Since dark matter is measured through gravity, but we don't know the mass behind it, isn't it possible that it comes from another universe?</p>
","<p>This is a bit of a speculative question, but I can answer it.</p>

<p>Dark matter has been observed in galaxies, and the distributions of dark matter in galaxies have also been measured. It seems clear that the matter is firmly in our universe - we just can't detect it with electromagnetic radiation.
*However, there are ideas (extremely speculative) that dark matter <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Mass_in_extra_dimensions"">is from a different spatial dimension</a>. It sort of explains why gravity is so weak (it ""leaks off"" through the other dimension(s)). Note, though, that this highly, <em>highly</em> speculative.</p>

<p>There are ideas like this in string theory, too. Some say that we are trapped on a <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology"">brane</a></em>, a section of space-time with three spatial dimensions. However, there are one or more additional dimensions. All of these dimensions are known as the <em>bulk</em>. Gravity can ""leak off"" through these extra dimensions. Some theories take this to the extreme, and say that there exist many universes (of a certain number of dimensions each, but with less dimensions that those of the bulk) that are branes, just like ours. These have been considered the source of phenomena such as dark energy - in which case your scenario is within the realm of plausibility.</p>

<p>Telescopes for <em>cubesats</em>?!</p>

<p>The article had this illustration, and I'm trying to figure out how that is converted into a clear image without distortions, and why they say it allows the telescope to be much more compact. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ibh9Q.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ibh9Q.jpg"" alt=""freeform optics mirror design""></a></p>

<p>It was a short article that didn't even try to explain this, and when I went looking for other articles on the topic for non-experts I found zip. Perhaps this is very challenging to explain, but I thought I'd ask anyhow. I told an enthusiastic youth just a few weeks ago that it wasn't possible to launch a telescope capable of anything useful on a cubesat. Oops...</p>
","<p>Freeform optics are a response to the specific challenge of cramming a telescope in a very limited space. A traditional instrument would have all optics symmetrical and aligned on the same axis. It would waste a lot of space within the cubesat. Also, traditional designs tend to be much longer than they are wider; they don't fit well in a cube; it is very hard to make classic instruments that are as short as they are wide.</p>

<p>But with freeform optics you could bounce light in a few directions within the cube. You'd still achieve a decent focal length, and you would use all the volume available to you.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/h2Vxw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/h2Vxw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Since light is reflected from mirrors at angles different from normal, you cannot use the traditional symmetric shapes such as parabolic, spherical, etc. You need to basically take a paraboloid and squish it in one direction so that it works about the same like a parabolic mirror (I'm simplifying), but at an angle of reflection of, say, 45 degrees.</p>

<p>In such an instrument you could have multiple ""potato chip"" mirrors, as in the diagram above. You have to design the instrument as a whole; computer simulations will adjust the shape of each mirror until the performance of the whole instrument is close to a classic straight design.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the manufacturing precision is such that freeform optics are only usable at long wavelengths such as infrared, where less precise optics can be used. But technology improves all the time. It also depends on how much aberration you can tolerate in your image.</p>

<p>For usage from ground level this is less useful, unless you absolutely need a telescope in a very small form factor for some reason. Classic optics are still preferred when space and shape are not restricted.</p>

<p>Small asteroids, from a the size of sand grains (properly called meteoroids) to a few meters across hit the Earth everyday without causing harm and are undetectable until they hit (we call the trace as they hit the atmosphere a meteor) They cause no damage.

<p>Somewhat larger objects can cause some local damage For example the Chelyabinsk asteroid caused damage from broken glass in Russia. Objects this large <em>may</em> be detected a few hours to a few days. The Chelyabinsk asteroid wasn't, and hit with no warning. We have observed some small asteroids just prior to them hitting the atmosphere.</p>

<p>We have found large numbers of objects whose orbit can bring them close to Earth. <em>Every object we have found has an orbit that <strong>misses Earth</em></strong>.  With each new object that is located we can forecast its orbit for several centuries. However new objects are being found all the time. It is <em>possible</em> that a object will be discovered that has the potential to cause damage to a wider area. If the object happened to be on an orbit that had it collide with Earth then there <em>could</em> be less than a year's warning. That is very unlikely. It is slightly more likely that an object will be discovered to be on a collision course only after several orbits, in which case there would be years or decades warning.</p>

<p>Very large objects that could threaten the survival of humankind are rare. There are some such objects, (larger than Florence). We hope that we have now detected all very large near Earth asteroids, and discoverd them to be non-threatening (like Florence is not a current threat to Earth)</p>

<p>I think it is safe to assume that the supposedly thrown camera would not reach the event horizon in one piece. So my question is : </p>

<p>If I dropped a TV camera into a black hole, will it be destroyed before it reaches the event horizon, and if so, why?</p>
","<p>If the black hole has no surrounding matter, so that there is no violent radiation generated by accretion or the like, then it still depends on the mass of the black hole. If it is in the thousands of solar masses or more, it is possible for a realistic camera to survive free-fall to the horizon. This is essentially a non-issue for supermassive black holes. On the other hand, smaller black holes are quite a bit more punishing.</p>

<p>For Newtonian gravity with potential $\Phi$, in a free-falling frame, a particle at $x^k$ near the origin of the frame will be accelerated at
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2x^j}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = -\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial x^j} = -\frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial x^j\partial x^k}x^k\text{,}$$
where the the second derivatives of the potential, $\Phi_{,jk}$, form the so-called <em>tidal gravitational field</em>. Since $\Phi = -GM/r$ for a point-source, you should expect the tidal forces on a free-falling object to be proportional to $GM/r^3$ times the size of the object. Thus, at the Schwarzschild radius, this is on the order of $c^6/(GM)^2$.</p>

<p>Of course, black holes are not Newtonian. However, it turns out that for the non-rotating, uncharged (Schwarzschild) black hole, radial free-fall of a test particle has the same form as in Newtonian theory, except in Schwarzschild radial coordinate (not radial distance) and proper time of the particle (not universal time), so the above is essentially correct even for Schwarzschild black holes.</p>

<p>To be relativistically correct, the tidal forces on an free-falling object are described by the equation of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_deviation"" rel=""noreferrer"">geodesic deviation</a>, in which the gravitoelectric part of the Riemann curvature provides forms the tidal tensor:
$$\frac{\mathrm{D}^2x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\tau^2} = -R^\alpha{}_{\mu\beta\nu} u^\mu u^\nu x^\beta\text{.}$$
In Schwarzschild spacetime, this turns out to be $+2GM/r^3$ in the radial direction, stretching the free-falling object, and $-GM/r^3$ in the orthogonal directions, squeezing it. This stretching-and-squeezing due to gravitational tidal forces is sometimes called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghettification"" rel=""noreferrer"">spaghettification</a>.</p>

<p>Some example numbers: say the camera size is on the order of $0.1\,\mathrm{m}$. The the following are the approximate tidal accelerations near the horizon for black holes of different multiples of solar masses:</p>

"If Pluto is tidally locked with Charon, is its rotation still slowing down?","354","","<p>I know that a a planet or moon's rotation will slow down or speed up until it is tidally locked with a body, is Pluto's rotation being affected by the sun or is it being forced by Charon just to to be tidally locked with Charon?</p>
","<p>Short answer.  Pluto's rotation is 100% governed by Charon, or, more accurately, the Pluto-Charon system.  The sun is irrelevant to it's rotation.</p>

<p>Small point to add.  Pluto's rotation is pretty much governed by the Pluto-Charon orbit.  If Charon moves closer to Pluto, Pluto's rotation will correspondingly increase.   If Charon moves further away, Pluto's rotation will decrease.  That's how tidal locking works.   I answered the question in regards to the orbit changing, not the rotation changing, but in a tidally locked system the rotation period follows the orbital period.</p>

<p>Long answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know that a a planet or moon's rotation will slow down or speed up
  until it is tidally locked with a body,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tidal locking doesn't always happen.  For distant orbits the tidal force that makes tidal locking happen is often very weak and very slow, often requiring more time than the lifespan of the star in that solar system.</p>

<p>Also, for high eccentricity orbits, classic tidal locking is impossible though resonant orbits like Mercury's 3:2 around the sun are probably fairly common.   And many moons will escape their planet or crash into their planet long before mutual tidal locking occurs, though it's not uncommon for moons themselves to be tidally locked.   Also small moons don't have sufficient gravity to pull the object they orbit into mutual tidal locking.  </p>

<p>For mutual tidal locking, like Pluto-Charon, there needs to be respectible mass ratio or, perhaps an initial formation where orbital speed and rotation are very close, so it doesn't take much force to lead to mutual tidal locking.  Our moon, at 1/81st the mass of the Earth, would eventually cause the Earth to tidal lock to it, but estimates say it will take longer than it will take the sun to go red-giant for that to happen, and the expected outcome of our moon is that it will crash into the Earth before there is mutual tidal locking.  </p>

<p>So, mutual tidal locking like pluto-charon is actually pretty rare because you need the smaller object to have a significant percentage of mass to the larger one.   One-way tidal locking is quite common, but your question addresses mutual tidal locking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is Pluto's rotation being affected by the sun or is it being forced by
  Charon just to to be tidally locked with Charon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a quick approximation, the tidal force can roughly/bad approximation be estimated by the size of the object in the sky times it's density.   There's other factors, ofcourse, like the size of the object receiving the tidal force, but for a rough approximation, the size in the sky gives an estimate.   For example, the sun and moon each take up about 1/2 a degree of arc when viewed from the surface of the Earth, so they have similar tidal forces due to having similar size.   The major difference being that the Moon is about 2.4 times more dense than the sun so it's tides are correspondingly about 2.4 times as strong.</p>

<p>This visual size approximation doesn't work for very-near-earth orbits, as it's the size that would appear from the center of the Earth, not the surface that should be applied.</p>

<p>Charon from the surface of Pluto is huge.   It spans several degrees of arc, over 10 times the size the Moon appears from the Earth.   The sun, from Pluto is tiny about 1/30th the size it appears from Earth, which is only about 50% larger than Venus appears in the sky at it's largest, or, about 1 minute of arc, but even at that distance the sun is still bright enough to cast visible shadows and would probably damage your retina if you stared at it.   It would be the most impressive light in the sky from Pluto, but still tiny, so the tidal effect on Pluto-Charon would be quite small.  (I'd prefer not to do the math, my math tends to run into errors and I'm not good with mathjax).</p>

<p>But the sun's tidal influence on the Pluto-Charon system is close to negligible, It can be calculated and it's not zero, but it's very small.   Over a very very very long time, the Sun's tidal force will sap energy from the Pluto-Charon system and draw them closer towards each other, but at that distance, billions maybe trillions of years.  Pluto is probably more likely to meet a different fate well before then, such as crashing into Neptune or being thrown out of the solar-system before the Pluto-Charon system becomes unstable.  </p>

<p>It would be different if Pluto-Charon orbited at Mercury or Venus distance (ignoring the obvious melting of ices and outgassing in a warmer environment).  That close, the sun becomes a major player in the future of the mutually tidally-locked systems, likely causing them to crash into each other, but at Pluto distance, there's virtually no effect.</p>

<hr>

<p>When a system is mutually tidally locked with a nearly circular orbit, then it's very stable.  If there's no tidal locking or one way tidal locking like Earth-Moon, then there's a tidal bulge that leads or follows the moon and that creates a force that can slow down or speed up the planet and push the moon away or draw it in closer.   With tidal locking, there's no leading or following with the tidal bulge, so the orbit is less prone to change.   There's always some orbital variation and some orbital energy converted to heat due to no orbits being perfectly circular, but mutual tidal locking is still a very stable orbital system with less change than most, as long as there isn't a 3rd party forcing change, such as a debris cloud creating drag or outgassing or orbiting close to a massive body that saps energy from the tidally locked orbit. </p>

<p>No orbits are stable forever, and considering all the factors, Pluto and Charon are close enough that they exchange some atmosphere and as the sun grows more luminous over time, that exchange will probably increase, and likely both are losing mass slowly over time due to the solar wind.    This very gradual loss of mass, I would think, would cause the orbit to expand, but very slowly.   With no loss of gas by the solar wind, the Pluto-Charon orbit should very slowly contract due to tidal forces from the sun and some orbital energy being converted into heat, but both of those effects are very slow.   Mutual tidal locking is for the most part a very stable system.</p>

<p>Hope that wasn't too long, but that's the gist of it.   My answer could probably be improved with some math and some linked references but that would make it even longer.</p>

"Why does lithium fuse at lower temperatures than hydrogen?","354","","<p>This is a basic question, but it's been bugging me. In the Wikipedia article for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_burning"" rel=""nofollow"">lithium burning</a>, it states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stars, which by definition must achieve the high temperature (2.5 × 10^6 K) necessary for fusing hydrogen, rapidly deplete their lithium. This occurs by a collision of lithium-7 and a proton producing two helium-4 nuclei. The temperature necessary for this reaction is just below the temperature necessary for hydrogen fusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would imagine that with lithium having more protons, it would have a stronger Coulomb repulsion and require higher temperatures to fuse with hydrogen. Now, this article is pretty sketchy since it cites no sources, and I would normally dismiss this. But according to <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/304151/fulltext/35775.text.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, lithium burning occurs in protostars, before hydrogen fusion even takes place. How could lithium fuse with hydrogen at temperatures that low?</p>
","<p>The slowest reaction rate in the pp chain determines how quickly hydrogen can ""burn"" in the core of a sun-like star. That rate-determining step is actually the fusion of two protons to form deuterium via the diproton and a weak interaction decay.</p>

<p>The fusion of lithium, whereby it fuses with a proton and then splits into two Helium nuclei is actually part of the PPII series of reactions that convert helium 3 into helium 4. It does not involve weak interactions and therefore the cross-section at a given temperature is much higher than the first step in the pp chain, regardless of the stronger coulomb repulsion between the reactants. It is therefore initiated at lower temperatures - as you say, Li ""burning"" occurs in low-mass pre main sequence stars well before hydrogen ""burning"" commences (but after deuterium burning).</p>

"Sources of Turbulence in the ISM","353","","<p>What sources of turbulence exist within the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium"">Interstellar medium (ISM)</a>? Which ones are physically the most important for newly forming stellar systems?</p>
","<h2>Turbulence sources:</h2>

<p>There are numerous sources of turbulence in the interstellar medium, at all scales:</p>

<ul>
<li>at large scales, there is the <strong>shear from galactic rotation</strong>. One way to sustain turbulence and to couple large and small scales would be the <strong>magnetorotational instability</strong> (MRI).</li>
<li>at large scales, <strong>gravitational instabilities</strong> can also play a significant role, through spiral structures.</li>
<li><strong>outflows and jets</strong> from forming stars play an important role, releasing a lot of energy in the ISM.</li>
<li>in star forming regions, <strong>massive stars</strong> are also important. Radiation and stellar winds from massive stars are an important input of energy in the ISM. And eventually, the most massive ones will blow up in supernovæ, releasing even more energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, one could then regards separatly three processes related to massive stars:</p>

<ul>
<li>stellar winds</li>
<li>ionizing radiation</li>
<li>supernova explosion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importance for star formation:</h2>

<p>They are all relevant to star formation, one way or another. One key property of turbulence is to cascade from large to small scales; therefore, even if you inject turbulence at large scales (galactic scale) you'll get turbulent motions down to the scale of a molecular cloud.</p>

<p>A nice illustration of the tubulent cascade is the Larson's relation (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981MNRAS.194..809L"" rel=""noreferrer"">Larson 1981</a>):
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BcSla.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The Larson's relation shows the evolution of the velocity dispersion with the size of the structure you're looking at. Velocity dispersion is an indicator of turbulence. Indeed, these dispersions are non-thermal: knowing the typical temperature of the MIS (about 10 K), one can estimate the thermal velocity of, for example, the CO molecule ($v_th = \sqrt{2kT/\mu m_H}$, with $k$ the Boltzman constant, $T$ the temperature, $\mu$ the mean molecular wright and $m_H$ the hydrodgen atom mass) that is about 0.07 km s$^{-1}$. Measured velocity dispersions are of the order of 1 to 10 km s$^{-1}$, and these is interpreted as a turbulence signature (and estimate).</p>

<h2>Details:</h2>

<p><strong>Energy rates:</strong> values are given (roughly) for the Milky Way</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>MRI</strong>: $ \small \dot e = 3 \times 10^{-29} {\rm erg\ cm}^{-3}\ {\rm s}^{-1} $;</li>
<li><strong>Gravitational instabilities</strong>: $\small \dot e = 4 \times 10^{-29} {\rm erg\ cm}^{-3}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$;</li>
<li><strong>Outflows</strong>: $\small \dot e = 2 \times 10^{-28} {\rm erg\ cm}^{-3}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$;</li>
<li><strong>Ionizing radiation</strong>: $\small \dot e = 5 \times 10^{-29} {\rm erg\ cm}^{-3}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$</li>
<li><strong>Supernovæ explosions</strong>: $\small \dot e = 3 \times 10^{-26} {\rm erg\ cm}^{-3}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$</li>
<li><strong>Stellar winds</strong>: it strongly depends on the type of star: it varies as the power of -6 of the star's luminosity. It therefore ranges from an energy comparable to a supernova explosion (or even more for Wolf-Rayet stars) to almost nothing.</li>

"What are the differences between TESS and PLATO exoplanet telescopes?","353","","<p>Within a year now it has been decided to launch TESS in 2017 and PLATO in 2024, space telecopes of NASA and ESA. They seem to have very similar science goals, both searching for transiting Earth sized planets in the HZ of the brighest (nearest) stars across all or most of the sky. </p>

<p>Are these missions as overlapping as they seem on first sight, or are there important complementarities? Is it perhaps the intention for PLATO to continue the observations of the planets discovered by TESS in order to get a longer time series?</p>
","<p>Here is what one commentator has said about TESS in comparison to PLATO:</p>

<p><em>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), to launch in 2017, seems superficially to be a similar mission to Plato. It will potentially discover hundreds of planets before Plato even gets off the ground in 2024. However, the limited sensitivity of its cameras mean it is completely blind to Earth-like worlds around sun-like stars. Astroseismology is also off-limits for TESS, meaning the size of any worlds it does discover will be highly uncertain. Unlike Plato, it will also move between patches of sky every 30 days, allowing only hot, short-period planets to be found.
With all other new telescopes, both in space and on the ground, limited to finding super-Earths around small stars, Plato is the only mission on the table truly capable of discovering an Earth-like world around a star like our Sun. And by targeting bright stars that allow atmospheric follow-up, it is not impossible to think that, as well as the first truly habitable planet, Plato could find the first inhabited one too.</em></p>

<p>Is this really possible? I would bet that it will never happen.</p>

<p>Supossing that it happens, will Moon get tidal locked again? Yes. As long as there are water on Earth suffering tides from Moon, these same water will attract one side of the Moon differentially from the other, so Moon will get locked again with the same face towards us.</p>

"How does the concept of a universe with no center work?","351","","<p>I understand basically that the universe is homogenous (looks the same from every point) and I was told in my astro class that it's supposed to have no center, but how that works boggles my mind. I can't get over the feeling that from some point in the universe a civilization could look in a certain direction and see a sign indicative of the direction towards the edge or the center, like younger galaxies or a lack of galaxies moving a certain direction. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks to Sir Cumference for highlighting some things that are unclear about my question. Sure, to a certain extent you might be able to think of the universe as being without a center, but if you think of a ball growing larger from nothing, and you pick a random point in the growing sphere, you can always say that the point is further from some points on the sphere than others, or in other words, that there is a direction towards a ""center"".</p>

<p>Any other details you can give that are related at all would be extremely welcome.</p>
","<p>When we talk about the universe, we are really talking about one of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The observable universe, which is everything we can possibly see.</li>
<li>The Universe, which is everything that has ever existed, currently exists, and will exist.</li>
</ul>

<p>The observable universe has its own center, usually the Earth. It is a spherical region of everything that we can see, essentially anything whose light has reached us. We usually refer to this when we say things like ""there are $10^{86}$ atoms in the universe.""</p>

<p>In reality, everyone has their own observable universe, and it can change depending on where you are. An exoplanet far away has its own observable universe, and can receive light from different places. Essentially, you are the center of your own observable universe.</p>

<p>I assume you're talking about the latter, though. The Universe (notice the capital ""U"") is all of space and time and its contents. Anything that has existed, will exist, and currently exists is part of it.</p>

<p>The Universe is thought to be infinitely large, so it can't have a center. The center of something is the point equidistance from the edges, but if something spans infinitely long, it would just keep going. It wouldn't have an edge, and thus it wouldn't have a center. You couldn't find the point equidistant from the edges if it just spans infinitely.</p>

<p>You might ask, ""then where did the Big Bang start? Surely it must've been the center of the Universe, right?"" Well, you can say the Big Bang happened everywhere. Before the Big Bang, matter filled most of the Universe's emptiness. It was essentially dense, and so got extremely hot to the point where no hadrons could form.</p>

<p>It is thought that this temperature caused space itself to expand. Essentially, more space was created in between all the matter, until everything was able to cool down. This is what we call the Big Bang. It didn't happen at a certain point, but rather it happened everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I understand your confusion. Let me just clear some common misconceptions:</p>

<p>The Universe is not like a ball. Rather, you can think of it like a flat grid, and its ""expansion"" just means that the distances between objects on the grid are getting larger. In essence, more space is being created between the objects. That's what we mean by expansion — that objects are moving away from each other, since more space is being created between them.</p>

<p>Here's an easy analogy: imagine you are walking your dog. Suddenly, the ground begins expanding between you. You and your dog will separated and continue receding away from each other.</p>

<p>That's essentially happening everywhere: space is expanding between everything, so we are drifting away from other galaxies. The Universe is infinite, and we can constantly drift apart from other objects because space is being created in between us. Here's a GIF I made that might help you get it:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/amQeZ.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/amQeZ.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You can see how the galaxies drift apart as the space between them increases. And this happens everywhere in the Universe. So let's keep that in mind and clear up the Big Bang.</p>

<p>The Big Bang did not happen at a single point, nor did the Universe begin at a single point. The Universe is, and has always been, infinite. The Big Bang was just when the Universe's expansion really began — that is, when objects started drifting away from each other. The Universe was still infinite, but there was less space between the matter.</p>

<p>This density caused the Universe to get extremely hot and expand. So here, space itself was distorted and began to expand. More and more space was created between the matter, and still is now (although now it is mainly due to dark energy instead of heat).</p>

<p>If the galaxies are moving apart, are the solar systems within them also moving apart from one another (&amp; the planets within them), if they are, won't the Sun be moving away from the Earth?</p>

<p>Does the expansion of the universe occur at all scales or just large (inter-galactic) scales?</p>
","<p>The short answer is: gravitationally bound system will not be ripped by the accelerated expansion. </p>

<p>A longer answer: The current standard model (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model"">$\Lambda$CDM model</a>) says that everything started with the big bang. It released a lot of energy that pushed the Universe and is since then expanding. While it's expanding, gravitational attraction has been working to create the structures that we see today (planets, stars, galaxies, cluster of galaxies). </p>

<p>As the Universe expands, the density of matter and radiation within the Universe decreases. At about 5 billions years after the big bang, these densities became smaller than the density of Dark Energy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark-energy-dominated_era"">Dark-energy-dominated era</a>). The strange things about Dark Energy are that, 1) its  density remains a constant regardless of the expansion of the universe, and 2) it has anti-gravitational properties - it pushes rather than pulls. Once Dark Energy came to dominate the density of the universe it began to dominate its overall dynamics, and has caused the expansion of the universe to accelerate.</p>

","<p>A complete answer gets long and above my pay-grade, but when the earth and solar system were young, it's unlikely that the Earth had much atmosphere at all.   The young sun was hot enough to burn off most gases and ices in the inner solar-system and when the earth coalesced it was largely metals and silicates.  The oceans and atmosphere came later by comet and asteroid belt impacts, and, as Jeff Y points out, after that it's just heat and chemistry.   Oxygen or O2 binds so easily with other molecules, like Methane or Hydrogen or Iron that it goes away pretty quickly until those are used up.   </p>

The Moon's surface area is about 7.4% of Earth's (about 1/13.5) and it's mass about 1/81st of Earths.  <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/20489/moon-compared-to-earth/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>.  81/13.5 = about 6.  That means given equal pressure, the moon should accelerate 6 times as much which corresponds over small distances to 6 times the distance or 90 CM per year - BUT, that's if you ONLY take into account the pressure.</p>

<p>The effect of the sun losing mass has equal effect on both the Earth and the smaller Moon.  </p>

<p>And a 3rd factor to consider is the tidal bulge on the sun caused by the Earth-Moon system, which is very small but all these effects are small.   The Earth-Moon system creates a tiny bulge on the surface of the Sun and because the Sun rotates ahead of the Earth-Moon, that tiny tidal bulge has a tiny pull on the Earth-Moon system that slowly accelerates them and pushes them slowly away from the sun.  That effect is equal for both the Moon and Earth too.   </p>

<p>All 3 of those are factors in the 15 CM per year estimate and only one of them has 6 times the effect on the Moon than the Earth.   The planets Venus and Jupiter might also be factors in that 15 CM per year estimate too, but lets leave that alone for now.</p>

<p>If we consider the 3 body problem it gets very mathy, but I'll just talk about how it applies to solar pressure.   Lets start with a picture.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAdJP.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAdJP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When the Moon is waning its moving towards the sun and any pressure from the sun slows the moon down, (a tiny bit) and that slow-down moves the Moon closer to the Earth which speeds it up even more - funny how that works, pushing to slow something down in orbit and it goes faster - but that's how it works, cause potential energy converts to kinetic as the orbit drops, kinda like how falling makes things go faster.</p>

<p>When the Moon is waxing, it's moving away from the sun and any pressure from the sun speeds it up which moves it away from the earth and that in turn, slows it down.  So that's your answer in a nutshell.  The solar pressure doesn't push the moon away from the sun so much as it pushes the moon into a lower and then higher orbit around the Earth depending on where the Moon is in it's orbit around the Earth and the various positions in both the Moon's and Earth's elliptical orbits.  The overall effect is very difficult to calculate and I suspect it could go either way depending in part on the timing of large coronal mass ejections hitting the moon and in part on any possible resonance between the eccentricity of the Moon around the Earth and the Earth around the sun, er, I think.</p>

<p>What is safe to say is that the Earth-Moon system obeys the same surface area to mass ratio the Earth alone because that's simple momentum which needs to be conserved.    The Earth-Moon system has a combined surface area of 1.074 Earths and a combined mass of 1.012 Earths, so the Moon being in the Earth-Moon system makes the Earth move away due to solar pressure about 6% faster.  15 CM to 15.9 CM.  Not a very big change, and it's possible that the 15 CM estimate is based on the Earth-Moon barycenter not the Earth itself.</p>

<p>So, the effect is more of a wobble in the Moon's orbit around the earth than an actual force that pushes the Moon away from the sun faster than it pushes the Earth away.</p>

<p>All this, is, of-course, unimportant compared to the much bigger solar tidal force on the Earth-Moon system.   As the Moon gets closer to the sun (new moon in the picture above) The sun effectively pulls the Moon a little bit away from the Earth and when it's further from the sun (full moon), The Moon is effectively pulled towards the earth.  The net effect of this solar tide is a measurable wobble in the Moon's orbit around the earth.  The effect on the Moon's orbit around the earth due to photon pressure and coronal mass ejection pressure - basically insignificant.</p>

<p>Hope that's clear.</p>

"How dense would planet earth have to be to have the same gravity as Jupiter?","346","","<p>I was reading this <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/2315/how-small-can-a-planet-be-and-still-have-earth-like-gravity?rq=1"">question</a> about <code>how small could a planet be while having earth-like gravitational pull</code>. </p>

<p>This got me thinking, how dense would planet Earth have to be to have the same gravitational pull as Jupiter while all the other factors staying the same (even if it is impossible in the real world)?</p>

<p>If there are any formulas could you please explain them so I understand them please?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Sorry about some of the confusion but I meant keeping everything <strong>but</strong> the mass the same.</p>
","<p>There are at least two interpretations to this problem:</p>

<p>Per <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>, Jupiter's surface gravity is $2.528$ times Earth's. Thus, 
if the Earth were $2.528$ times denser, it would have the same surface 
gravity as Jupiter. The Earth's current density is $5.514$ grams per 
cubic centimeter, so the new density would be $2.528 \times 5.514$, or about 
$13.9394$ grams per cubic centimeter. This assumes we change Earth's mass, but not its radius.</p>

<p>@Rob_Jeffries answer assumes the Earth's mass remains constant and the radius changes. If the radius shrinks by a factor of $2$, the volume decreases by a factor of $8$, and the planet becomes 8 times more dense. The surface gravity increases by $4$, since it depends on the radius squared. In general, shrinking the planet's radius by $x$ will increase the density by $x^3$ and the gravity by $x^2$. If we want the gravity $2.528$ times higher, we choose $x = \sqrt{2.528}$ or right around $1.590$. This makes $x^3$ equal to about $4.019$. Multiplying that by Earth's current density of $5.514$, we get $22.16$ grams per cubic centimeter, pretty close to what Rob got.</p>

<p>So, you can't really change the density without changing anything else: either the mass or the volume must change.</p>

","<p>If you want to see a total solar eclipse, you just need to be between the two red lines on that map.  As long as you're within there, what we call the ""path of totality"", you will be able to see a total solar eclipse.</p>

<p>If you are outside of the red lines, you will only see a partial solar eclipse.  <a href=""https://www.greatamericaneclipse.com/nation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This map</a> shows what percentage of the sun will be covered the further north or south you are of the line.</p>

<p>Graham County is entirely within the path of totality, so you should see a total solar eclipse.  If you're planning to travel, however, it might be too late.  Most campgrounds and hotels within the path are already full.  If you're already within the path of totality, my recommendation would be to stay put.  Travelling on that day, or even that week, will be difficult.</p>

"Gravitational lensing in Newtonian physics","345","","<p>Famously, when Eddington attempted to measure gravitational lensing during the Eclipse, it was the measured <em>magnitude</em> of the lensing that gave gravity [pun, obviously, intended] to General Relativity - not the measurement of lensing itself. That is, Newtonian physics also predicted a lensing deflection, but only half of the deflection predicted by GR. </p>

<p>Question is: Why? I've read a lot about this, and I can see how when one integrates the Newtonian acceleration along the photon path with constant |v|=c this gives the 'correct' Newtonian value - but intuitively, I can't wrap my head around it. Why should a massless photon be affected by gravity at all in Newtonian gravity?</p>
","<p>A photon is an entity defined in the context of a relativistic field theory, and so it doesn't really make sense to talk about the Newtonian bending of a photon. Necessarily, we need to substitute an analogous question that's sensible in the Newtonian framework. To do so, we can imagine a classical <em>corpuscle</em> of light--appropriately enough, a theory of light advanced by Newton himself.</p>

<p>There are many problems with the Newtonian conception of light, but that's an issue for electromagnetism rather than gravity.</p>

<p>Critically, for a test particle, the trajectory depends on the initial velocity only, and not the mass. So we don't even have to address the mass of the light corpuscle at all to talk about its trajectory, as the acceleration is the gradient of the gravitational potential and if considering force (or gravitational potential <em>energy</em>), the mass cancels out anyway. If you wish to bring in the mass explicitly, we can still think of the trajectory of a massless particle as a limit of trajectories of particles with masses tending to zero but having the same velocity &mdash; a trivial limit because they're all the same trajectory in the Newtonian theory. On the other hand, if we recognize that light carries momentum, a Newtonian light corpuscle <em>shouldn't</em> have zero mass, so the question of what to do with a genuinely massless particle evaporates.</p>

<p>When people talk about the Newtonian deflection of light, they are typically considering a hyperbolic trajectory of test particle at the speed of light under Newtonian gravity. If the angle between the asymptotes is $\theta$, then $\theta = \pi$ represents a completely straight trajectory unaffected by gravity, and the eccentricity is
$$e = 1 + \frac{v_\infty^2R_p}{GM} = \frac{1}{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{\sin\psi}\text{,}$$
where $R_p$ is the periapsis distance and $2\psi = \pi-\theta$ is the measure of deflection. On the scale of the solar system, it doesn't matter whether we set $v_\infty = c$ or anywhere else along the trajectory. For example, if the velocity at peripasis is $c$ instead, then $e\mapsto e-2$, and so is negligible for light deflection due to the Sun, $e &gt; 10^{5}$. The total deflection is approximately
$$2\psi \approx e^{-1} \approx \frac{2GM}{c^2R_p}\text{,}$$
which is half the correct general-relativistic prediction.</p>

<p>Note that here we did <em>not</em> assume that the speed is constant along the hyperbolic orbit. That would not be consistent with Newtonian gravity. Rather, what we have is a situation where if $v = c$ <em>anywhere</em> along the trajectory, then the speed along any other point is so close to $c$ that it doesn't practically matter for considering light deflection.</p>

The small thumbs appear to be merely approximation, representation icons that aren't resized from the real-time image, but merely prepared in advance images, displayed depending on the current Moon's phase, calculated by the server.</p>

<p>If you try their Moon phase image generator (at the bottom of <a href=""http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/moon-phase-images"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a>), you'll see why they did it like that.

"Affordable night sky photography","343","","<p>As an amateur with limited budget, I'd be interested in taking photos of the night sky, trying to capture more detail than human eye armed with a lens of comparable parameters to what I have in my camera normally could see. I doubt I'd ever get down to details as fine as Jupiter's moons, but I'd hope to see detail of some nebulae I have a hard time seeing through my inexpensive telescope, stars too dim to notice in less-than-perfect conditions etc. I'm interested in taking full-sky images just as well as zooms on specific objects too.</p>

<p>Currently, I have a lower-end SLC camera, with two lenses - good sharpness though lower aperture with 50-120mm focal length, and a wide-angle, high-brightness one (about 12-50mm) currently. Firmware hacks allow me to take photos of arbitrarily long time, and I have the remote to start and stop it without touching the camera, and generally software-wise the camera is quite powerful. One of the lenses (the longer focal length) is of ""standard professional"" quality level too.</p>

<p>Is this sufficient to get started? If so, what kind of settings should I use? If not, what other kind of entry-level equipment would I need to obtain/build on budget to get started with night sky photography?</p>
","<p>There are several options.</p>

<p>You can do star trail photos with just a tripod. If you have dark skies, Point the camera near the pole star, do a long exposure, and get star trails as the sky appears to rotate around the pole.</p>

<p>If you're in a light polluted area, then you'll find your maximum exposure time is limited by the light pollution - expose for long enough and the light pollution background will saturate one or more colour channels - which could prevent you using a long enough exposure to get long trails.</p>

<p>You can also take pictures of the moon - since it's basically a gray rock in bright sunlight, you don't need a long exposure at all for this. But you do need a long focal length to make the moon big enough to fill a decent part of the frame, and at 150 mm it's likely to be disappointingly small. (You need around 1500mm or so to fill most of an APS sized sensor frame).</p>

<p>You can also do constellation photography with just a tripod. The trick here is to keep the exposure short enough that the rotation of the earth doesn't cause significant star trailing.  As a rough rule of thumb, divide 400 by the lens focal length to get the approximate exposure time in seconds (thus varies in practice depending on where you're aiming, and how picky you are about trailing, but should give you a starting point). Thus with a 50mm lens, you can get away with around 8 seconds, around 2-3 seconds with a 150mm lens, and around 33 seconds with a 12mm lens.</p>

<p>You can improve results by stacking several exposures in software - try the free Deep Sky Stacker - which will reduce noise and usually give you a cleaner result.</p>

<p>For longer exposures, you'll need some sort of tracking mount to compensate for the earth's rotation and prevent star trailing. You can either build a barn door tracker, as mentioned in other replies, which rotate a camera platform around a hinge whose axis points at the celestial pole, or look at a commercial solution.</p>

<p>There are several mounts designed for use with cameras, such as Vixen's polarie, Skywatcher's star adventurer mount (or similar from Vixen or Ioptron), or the Astrotrak system (or Kenko's Sky Memo (not sure if this is still available)). Note that with some of these you also need to budget for a couple of tripod heads - one to point the mount at the celestial pole, and one to point the camera.</p>

<p>Or you could look at a motorised german equatiorial mount - which would also let you use a telescope - but to get good long exposure images with a telescope usually requires a good mount, which range from expensive to very expensive - and may also require autoguiding (automatic correction using a second guide camera and software) to apply corrections for long exposures. Long exposure deep sky imaging is more accessible than it was, but is still expensive to do well (and easily capable of soaking up as much money as you want to throw at it.)</p>

<p>Note that popular go-to alt-az mounted are limited for long exposure imaging, as although goto alt-az mounts can track objects - which is fine for visual use - they suffer from an effect called field rotation which makes the field of view gradually rotate, causing star trailing after a while (around 30s or so - it depends on latitude and where you're pointing). German equatorial mounts, with one axis pointed at the celestial pole, don't suffer from this.</p>

<p>For planetary imaging, the planets are bright enough that you can capture video with a webcam (or similar planetary astro camera) and telescope, and then process the video to stack the best frames. This is a different type of imaging to the long exposure deep sky stuff.</p>

Can a celestial body even qualify as a planet if it is floating around by itself?</p>
","<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>.. Planets that don't orbit around a star are known as <strong>Rogue Planets</strong>. There is nothing preventing a rogue planet from having one or many moons. </p>

<p>Not so long ago, the first <strong>candidate for a free-floating exoplanet-exomoon system</strong> was presented in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3951"">this paper</a>. It looks like a gas giant several times larger than Jupiter with a sub-Earth mass moon. </p>

<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0945"">Another study</a> calculated and simulated scenarios where planets where ejected from their orbits around a star and concluded that around <strong>five percent</strong> of Earth-sized planets who are accompanied by Moon-sized natural satellites would retain them after the event.</p>

I have collimated my telescope already but when I'm looking at Mars or Jupiter (not a star I'm sure), all I see is a white dot. Even if I use my 6mm with a 2x barlow, Mars still looks like a white dot but with a liiittle bit of a gray shade like a 3/4 moon. Of course I focused my eyepiece before.

","<p>It seems that you haven't align properly your finder (or) laser. You can align at day with a chimney, but at night you must start with the moon and after that you are sure that you are pointing correctly move to a well known feature (like Pleiades cluster in Taurus) and try to find it with the scope (after that you can move to a star (maybe Mizar in Ursa Mayoris or Albireo in Cygnus if you are in the northern hemisphere) after that you must be sure that the finder and laser are pointing correctly.</p>

<p>Other question is that (probably) you are using a very high magnification with that telescope. I have myself a RTF newtonian 114 / 500 and I usually works with 20 mm eyepice (that is 25x), you are using about 216x that is almost the maximum theorically magnification for that aperture. Maybe you should use the 6 mm eyepiece without the barlow (that is 108x more or less) this should be enough but with cheap optics that could be a very high magnification also. I think that you could try with a bigger eyepiece... maybe 15mm plössl (30x and about 1.5º of size)</p>

"How do stellar temperatures vary?","342","","<p>The temperature of the surface of the Sun (photosphere) is between 4500° - 6000° Kelvin. Inside the core, it's around 15.7 million degrees Kelvin.</p>

<p>In other types of stars (neutron stars, white dwarves, etc.), what is the temperature of these areas (though many do not have these same layers) and how to they compare to the temperatures of the sun?  </p>
","<p>This question has two parts:</p>

<p><strong>Surface Temperatures</strong></p>

<p>A very useful diagram which shows surface temperatures, and also gives you the temperature of any star you can observe is the Herzsprung-Russell Diagram, this one from <a href=""http://www.le.ac.uk/ph/faulkes/web/stars/o_st_overview.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">le.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XyJyp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see, the yellow of our own sun places it in the 4.5 kKelvin to 6 kKelvin, as noted in the question. This temperature is down towards the lower end of average. The main sequence, where most stars are, tops out about 20 kKelvin, and there are some up towards the 40 kKelvin region - they aren't shown here as they are much rarer.</p>

<p>White dwarves are a little hotter than our sun - between 6 kKelvin and 10 kKelvin.</p>

<p>Neutron stars are way off the main sequence - young ones can be over 1 MKelvin!</p>

<p><strong>Core temperature:</strong></p>

<p>Internally, the core temperatures are dependent on the mass of the star. In our sun, energy is delivered via the proton-proton chain mechanism, which occurs up to about 20 MKelvins, whereas more massive stars can use the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycle - which happens from about 15 MKelvins upwards.</p>

<p>The differences are mainly down to convection and radiation differences - this extract from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia's Main Sequence page</a> describes this in some detail:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because there is a temperature difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward via radiation and convection. A radiation
  zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against
  convection and there is very little mixing of the plasma. By contrast,
  in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of
  plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending.
  Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than
  radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep
  temperature gradient. In massive stars (above 10 solar
  masses) the rate of energy generation by the CNO cycle is very
  sensitive to temperature, so the fusion is highly concentrated at the
  core. Consequently, there is a high temperature gradient in the core
  region, which results in a convection zone for more efficient energy
  transport. This mixing of material around the core removes the
  helium ash from the hydrogen-burning region, allowing more of the
  hydrogen in the star to be consumed during the main-sequence lifetime.
  The outer regions of a massive star transport energy by radiation,
  with little or no convection. Intermediate mass stars such as
  Sirius may transport energy primarily by radiation, with a small core
  convection region. Medium-sized, low mass stars like the Sun have
  a core region that is stable against convection, with a convection
  zone near the surface that mixes the outer layers. This results in a
  steady buildup of a helium-rich core, surrounded by a hydrogen-rich
  outer region. By contrast, cool, very low-mass stars (below 0.4 solar
  masses) are convective throughout. Thus the helium produced at the
  core is distributed across the star, producing a relatively uniform
  atmosphere and a proportionately longer main sequence lifespan.</p>

"Are the planets Trappist-1 in the solar system?","341","","<p>I'm an Astronomy noob, but I'm interested in learning how stars and planets work. Everything started with the Trappist-1. I read about it, and it's fascinating. However, it's impossible for me to localize it with my current state of knowledge. Therefore, I would like to ask some general questions here. </p>

<p>First of all, during high school, I have learned that we are in the solar system and there are some planets orbiting the sun. Easy to remember and imagine, but there are stars, planets, constellations, etc. which I can't manage to relate to this basic system that I learned about. </p>

<p>And what confused me a lot are these two pictures: </p>

<p>From the pictures, I can see that Trappist is in fact in the solar system. Is this right? And if this is right, why in the world did it take us so many years to find it? We have one Voyager that is almost out from the solar system. Couldn't it find it before? And is it possible to find more planets in our solar system? Is it because Voyager went only in the x-y direction, and not ""perpendicular"" to the orbits?</p>

<p>I'm sorry for asking these stupid questions, but I simply can't build new knowledge on my current low-level understanding of the solar system. This is my current knowledge: 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/z97A8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/z97A8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Can you please help me to answer the above questions?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>During high school, I have learned that we are in the solar system and there are some planets orbiting the Sun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes that is correct. According to current definitions of what counts as a planet, there are 8 planets orbiting our Sun $-$ Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. There are also a collection of smaller ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dwarf Planets</a>"" which include (in no particular order): Pluto, Ceres, Eris, and Makemake. There's also a lot of other minor solar system bodies out there like asteroids, comets, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but there are stars, planets, constellations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there are many other stars out there besides our own (as you can see by simply looking up at the night sky). Each of those stars has the potential for having its own planets, much like ours does. Any planet outside our own solar system is referred to as an exoplanet (<a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/browse/exo-?s=t"" rel=""noreferrer"">exo-</a> meaning outside or external). Within the past 20 or so years we've developed the technology to find exoplanets around other stars and this TRAPPIST-1 discovery was simply the latest and most sensational discovery. To date we've discovered <a href=""https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/"" rel=""noreferrer"">~3500 exoplanets</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What confused me a lot are these two pictures. [...] And this definition of an exoplanet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those pictures, while seeming to show the the TRAPPIST-1 planets in our solar system, are not indicating that those planets actually reside in our solar system. Instead, what they're trying to do is compare the new TRAPPIST-1 system to our own so you can see the relative sizes. In your first image, you see Jupiter along with the orbits and distances of a few of its Moons. Next to it, you see the TRAPPIST-1 system with the seven planets we know of around it. Next to that is the Sun where you can just begin to see the orbit of Mercury (with the other planets beyond the bounds of the image. The point here is just to compare sizes of orbits. Clearly this TRAPPIST-1 system is much smaller than our own since all 7 planets orbit closer to the main star that even Mercury does for us. However, it is still bigger than Jupiter and its moons. They're not trying to make the point that these systems reside in the same place, just putting them together for comparison.</p>

<p>As for the second image you have, what they're trying to show here (I assume) is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone"" rel=""noreferrer"">habitability zone</a>. Around every star, depending on the star's size and temperature, there will be a good distance to be from the star that is optimal for life to exist. You don't want your planet to be too hot (by being too close) or too cold (by being too far). This image appears to be showing you the regions where a planet can be at a good distance from TRAPPIST-1 and still be at a good temperature. There is the Inner B line which I take to be the Inner <em>Boundary</em> of this zone. In other words, if a planet is any closer than this, it will be too hot. There's also the Outer B (or Outer Boundary) where beyond that, any planet would be too cold for life. Finally they have the Earth B. I can't be certain but I believe this point is actually the distance for the ""optimal"" temperature that we have here on Earth. In other words, the best chance a planet has of being at a good temperature for life is to orbit between Inner B and Outer B and ideally be at the distance of Earth B. This image also shows that the orbit of the planet TRAPPIST-1e is close to Earth B and still inside Outer B, meaning it is likely to be at a hospitable temperature for life (which is good news for us!). I won't go into what an AU (aside from mentioning it is a unit of distance) or the frost line, since they're not pertinent to the point of the image. Feel free to ask other questions for that.</p>

<p>Lastly, the definition of an exoplanet you found describes it an ""extrasolar planet"". That just means it is beyond our solar system $-$ ""<a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/browse/extra-?r=75&amp;src=ref&amp;ch=dic"" rel=""noreferrer"">extra-</a>"" meaning ""outside"" or ""beyond"" and ""<a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/browse/solar?s=t"" rel=""noreferrer"">solar</a>"" referring to our own Sun.</p>

<li>Camera: Canon EOS 350D DIGITAL</li>
<li>7 sec exposure</li>
<li>ISO: 1600</li>

","<p>In your friends picture are more artifacts than the one you showed in the 2nd picture a little bigger. I marked more of them in the picture below (click to enlarge).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ggkIY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ggkIYm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They are all in a perfect line to the bright light. So these artifacts are caused by the bright light and the lens of the camera. A lens is not flat it's, well lenticular (it's where the name came from). The main light source is shining from an angle on the lens. When light hits a surface two things happen (at least in most cases ignoring Brewster's angle). The two things are reflection and transmission (or absorption, but we are talking about a lens so I let this one drop here). Every time the light hits the surface of the lens, a part is reflected and another part is transmitted. But the lens has a thickness so when the light that was first transmitted now hits the back of the lens, a part is transmitted to the CCD sensor of your camera and a (smaller) part is reflected back into the lens. This can happen several times. Normally this effect is small enough it will not be noticed. But this picture is not a normal case. Most of the picture (dark sky) emits no light, the picture is very dark. In contrast to this, there is a bright light source dominating everything (related to luminescence). And we have a 7 sec exposure the picture is taken with. 7 sec are enough time for the CCD sensor to capture some light from the effect described above. </p>

<p>If you now want to know why is it green and not white. White light includes all wave lengths (colors) and every wave length is reflected in another angle on the surface of air-lens. The green wave length just had the best angle to be reflected severals time and still reach the CCD sensor. </p>

<p>So the most accurate answer to your question ""what is this green thing“ is: It's the flashlight (or what ever this light source is) that is seen in the bottom of the picture.</p>

"What is the current accepted theory for the fate of hot Jupiters?","340","","<p>It is well established that one main feature of many hot jupiters is their close proximity to their parent star, usually the equivalent of being within the orbit of Mercury.  So, these planets are gas giants and are very hot (hence their category).</p>

<p>However, a few discoveries have lead to questioning about what is the fate of these planets.</p>

<p><strong>example 1: HD 209458b  a.k.a. ""Osiris""</strong></p>

<p>According to the NASA page <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/newworlds/Osiris_leaks.html"">""Dying Planet Leaks Carbon-Oxygen""</a>, Osiris is doing more than 'evaporating', it is leaking carbon, oxygen alongside hydrogen in an envelope behind the planet that has been detected from Earth.  The significance of carbon and oxygen is stated from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although carbon and oxygen have been observed on Jupiter and Saturn, it is always in combined form as methane and water deep in the atmosphere. In HD 209458b the chemicals are broken down into the basic elements. But on Jupiter or Saturn, even as elements, they would still remain invisible low in the atmosphere. The fact that they are visible in the upper atmosphere of HD 209458b confirms that atmospheric 'blow off' is occurring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is stated in the article that Osiris is likely to become a hypothesised class of exoplanet known as a <strong>Chthonian</strong>, which is defined in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0312384"">""Evaporation rate of hot Jupiters and formation of Chthonian planets""</a> (Hebard et al. 2003) as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>new class of planets made of the residual central core of former hot
  Jupiters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These would be similar in size to Earth, but considerably denser.</p>

<p><strong>example 2: CoRoT-7b</strong></p>

<p>According to the NASA article <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2010/earthlike-exoplanet.html"">""Most Earthlike Exoplanet Started out as Gas Giant""</a>, CoRoT-7b is an Earth-sized planet where a hot Jupiter usually is found, they describe it as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is almost 60 times closer to its star than Earth, so the star appears almost 360 times larger than the sun does in our sky,"" Jackson said. As a consequence, the planet's surface experiences extreme heating that may reach 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit on the daylight side. CoRoT-7b's size (70 percent larger than Earth) and mass (4.8 times Earth's) indicate that the world is probably made of rocky materials. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The high day time temperature means that the star-facing side of the planet is likely to be molten, any tenuous atmosphere is also blasted away.  Scientists estimate that many Earth-masses may have been boiled off.  It also seems that the decreasing mass is causing the planet to be drawn closer to the star  -cause more material to be boiled off, hence the mass to decrease.</p>

<p>To summarise on of the scientists in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could say that, one way or the other, this planet is disappearing before our eyes,""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The question</strong></p>

<p>As these are only 2 examples of a possible process, the question is, what is the current accepted theory as to the fate of hot Jupiter exoplanets?</p>

<p>Could this also be the reason a hot Jupiter does not exist in our solar system?</p>
","<p>This is a fairly loaded question in that it depends heavily on what a ""hot Jupiter"" actually is defined to be. What is ""hot""? What is a ""Jupiter""? In reality, there's a continuum of planetary masses and distances from their parent star, and in the literature you'll commonly see references to ""hot Neptunes"", ""hot Saturns,"" etc.</p>

<p>The predominant theory as to how giant planets form is that they first coalesce from rock and ice beyond the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_%28astrophysics%29"">ice line</a>, the distance from the parent star at which water becomes solid. This distance is approximately where Mars lies today in our solar system. What's surprising about ""hot gas planets"" is that they are found <em>within</em> this ice line, significantly within. This implies that after they formed their cores, they migrated closer to their host stars via some currently undetermined process (for which there are several good candidates, but for now let's assume that the existence of hot planets shows that at least one of these processes operates quite regularly).</p>

<p>And what about the word ""hot""? Well, for the planets that are closest to their parent stars, there is known to be a <a href=""http://oklo.org/2010/07/31/radius-anomalies-2/"">radius anomaly</a>: The radii of these planets are significantly larger than models of giant planet structure irradiated by their host stars would predict. So I would define ""hot"" planets as gas giants whose radii are larger than what would be predicted by the standard models.</p>

<p>Now that we got some of the definitions out of the way, there's the question of survival. When giant planets are close to their parent stars, they become <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking"">tidally locked</a>. As a consequence, there is very little energy tidally dissipated on the surface of the giant planet, the shape of the planet is fixed and there are little internal motions. However, the giant planet <em>also</em> raises a tide on its host star as well, and because it takes a lot of angular momentum to change the spin of an object with 1,000 times more mass, the host stars are almost never going to be tidally locked to their closest planet.</p>

<p>The rate at which energy is dissipated within the star is highly uncertain, and this uncertainty is typically swept into a fudge parameter ""Q,"" the quality factor, with lower quality factors reflecting more dissipation. ""Q"" is measured for certain bodies in our own solar system (i.e. Earth and Jupiter) and in some stellar binaries, but is highly variable from body to body, ranging from about 10 for the Earth to 10^8 for some stars.</p>

<p>Whether a planet survives to be observed today depends on how long the orbital decay time, which is determined by Q, compares to the age of the system. For some systems, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASP-12b"">WASP-12b</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASP-19b"">WASP-19b</a>, which feature highly inflated hot Jupiters, Q is estimated to be small enough to cause them to fall into their host stars in a surprisingly short time (&lt; 10^7 years).</p>

<p>One other possibility is that the gas surrounding the rock/ice core is blasted away by the tremendous amount of heat deposited into the planet. This leaves you with a relatively low-density planet that's somewhat devoid of iron, as the cores of giant planets form further from their host stars than the rocky planets. There are a few candidate close-in, Neptune-mass objects that may have been produced as a result of them losing the bulk of their atmospheres in this way (Example: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6555"">GJ3470b</a>).</p>

<p>As for our own solar system, the formation of a hot Jupiter would have likely destroyed the inner solar system as it migrated close to the Sun, owing to the fact that it would violently perturb the inner planets' orbits. Additionally, the Sun would likely be enhanced in metals owing to the accretion of metal-rich material from this giant planet. While it's potentially possible that there was a hot Jupiter in our solar system before the other planets formed, it currently seems unlikely.</p>

<p>This answer is a bit rough as it doesn't calculate for the 5% of the Earth's land mass stipulation. The answer which would meet this would depend on whether only an <a href=""http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast161/Unit2/eclipses.html"" rel=""nofollow"">umbral shadow qualifies, or if a penumbral shadow</a> would also suffice. I suspect probably the prior. The shadow <em>would</em> certainly reach the Earth, but probably not cover 5% of it, which is a shame considering its diameter is actually <em>larger</em> than Earth's.

"How often do meteorites hit the Earth?","338","","<p>I heard of one that occurred in 2008 in the Nubian Desert in Sudan, how often does it happen? Is there a catalogue of all hits or are they very rare?</p>

<p>Related link (This is what inspired my interest not defining what I'm looking for)
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_TC3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_TC3</a></p>

<p>At the time of asking I had not thought about the distinction between hitting the atmosphere and hitting the Earth.</p>
","<p>There is definitely not a catalogue of all meteorites hitting Earth. For instance, the ones falling in desert areas and in the ocean aren't found, and even the ones falling in more populous regions are easily mistaken for normal rocks.</p>

<h2>Meteorite rate</h2>

<p>Meteorites come in all sizes, from sand grains to dinosaur-annihilating rocks.
The size distribution of these rocks (as well as most other things in space) follow an approximate power law, meaning that the smaller the meteorites you consider, the more often they hit Earth.</p>

<p>Estimating the total number of meteorites hitting Earth is difficult, but one study (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996MNRAS.283..551B"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bland et al. 1996</a>), looking at the composite of the earth on three arid site and considering the weathering over time, finds that between 36 and 116 meteorites over 10 g hit Earth every year per $10^6\,\mathrm{km}^2$. Multiplying by the surface area of Earth $A_\oplus$, that's <strong>roughly 20,000 to 60,000 meteorites hitting Earth per year</strong>.</p>

<h2>Meteor rate</h2>

<p>UPDATE: You want to know the rate of incoming <em>meteors</em>, i.e. all rocks that hit Earth's atmosphere. By definition, a meteor<em>ite</em> is a <em>meteor</em> that lands on the surface of Earth. Before it enters the atmosphere and becomes a meteor, you can call it asteroid, meteoroid, rock, pebble, or dust grain, depending on its size and your mood.</p>

<p><a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996Natur.380..323T"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Taylor et al. (1996)</a> have monitored incoming meteors with the AMOR radar in New Zealand and detected in one year 350,000 trails from incoming meteors of size 10–100 $\mu$m vaporizing in ~100 km's height. I don't know exactly how large an area AMOR monitors, but from simple trigonometry, and as an order-of-magnitude estimate, if the events happen in $h \sim 100\,\mathrm{km}$'s height, the radar can ""see"" a distance $d=\sqrt{h^2+2R_\oplus h} \sim 1100\,\mathrm{km}$, and thus covers an area $A\sim4\times10^6\,\mathrm{km}^2$. Thus, again multiplying by $A_\oplus$, this amounts to <strong>the order of 40 to 50 million meteors per year</strong>.</p>

<h2>Killer meteor rate and the Sudan asteroid</h2>

<p>The meteors discussed above is probably not what you had in mind. As mentioned, the bulk of these ""rocks"" are actually more like sand grains. So what is the rate of devastating killer-rocks from space? <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002Natur.420..294B"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brown et al. (2002)</a> fit a power law to several different data sets (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Near-Earth_Asteroid_Research"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LINEAR</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewatch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spacewatch</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_Asteroid_Tracking"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NEAT</a> and others), and find that the number $N$ of meteors above a diameter $D$ in meters is roughly
$$
N(&gt;D) \simeq 37 D^{-2.7}.
$$
The following plot is from their paper, with the long black line showing their fit, and the short black lines indicating the uncertainty:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cbdsz.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cbdsz.png"" alt=""meteors""></a></p>

<p>You mention the asteroid <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_TC3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2008 TC<sub>3</sub></a>, which had a diameter of 4.1 m.
According to the fit, <strong>such an event happens roughly $1/(37[4.1\,\mathrm{m}]^{-2.7})\sim$ once per year</strong>.</p>

<p>You can also see that the largest meteor hitting Earth in a century would be $(37\times100\,\mathrm{years})^{1/2.7}\sim20\,\mathrm{m}$, equivalent to $\sim500\,\mathrm{kiloton\,TNT}$.
Similarly, hundred-meter-sized objects ($\sim1\,\mathrm{megaton\,TNT}$) should hit us roughly once per 10,000 years. By extrapolation of their fit beyond observational data, <strong>objects of $D&gt;1\,\mathrm{km}$ — or 100 gigaton TNT — should hit Earth on average once every ~3.4 million years</strong>.</p>

"How long does a comet ""live""?","337","","<p>When a comet loses all his volatile material after many orbits around the Sun, it becomes a ""dead"" comet (like an asteroid, a centaur or whatever), see for example 2015 TB145. </p>

<p>Is there any way to determine the lifetime of a comet (expressed as the number of orbits before it becomes a dead comet)?</p>
","<p>If you don't mind an oversimplified answer.   There is a relatively straight forward relationship.   The life of a comet (in orbits not years) depends on 3 factors.   It's size, it's composition and how close it passes to the sun.</p>

<p>Comets are often referred to as dirty snowballs but the ratio of different types of ice and how much ""dirt"" or silicate material varies from comet to comet.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_nucleus#Size"" rel=""nofollow"">Average density is about 0.6</a> g/cc.  That variation is a factor in how much light gets reflected right back off the comet, and how easily the surface melts, but to make this answer somewhat easier, I'm going to ignore composition and make a simplified assumption that all comets are made of basically ice. </p>

<p>With that in mind, how much a comet loses per pass around the sun can be simplified into loss of radius.   Think of a block of ice sitting in space, facing the sun.   The rate of sublimation would simply be a product of how close the ice was to the sun.  It's not far off to oversimplify melt rate in terms of loss of radius over a pass near the sun.   </p>

<p>Halley's comet, for example <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley&#39;s_Comet#Orbit_and_origin"" rel=""nofollow"">has a fairly close pass to the sun</a>, at about 0.587 astronomical units (closer than Venus).  The closer a comet passes to the sun the faster it sublimates.   Halley's is expected to last another 100-125 orits.  <a href=""http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/1000112/"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a>.  </p>

<p>As mentioned above, there's some variation in terms of the density and different materials that make up a comet, but the primary factors are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion_and_aphelion"" rel=""nofollow"">Perihelion</a> and size of the comet.   </p>

<p>Halley's has a diameter of about 8 KM. (roughly speaking, it's 16x8x8 km, ellipsoid shape).   8,000 meters over 100-125 passes suggests it loses about 60-80 meters per pass around the sun and if we estimate that the ""dead comet"" after 100 or so orbits retains 1-3 KM of rocky material, the ballmark melt-rate of Halley's is somewhere in the 30-60 meters per pass around the sun, or a meter every couple-few days by sublimation.   A comet with a perihelion at .8 AU or 1 AU would lose less radius per pass.</p>

<p>A comet that passes within 0.3 AU instead of 0.6 might lose about 4 times as much per day as it's hit by 4 times the solar energy per square meter, but it spends fewer days due to a faster orbit near the sun.   Somebody might be able to run the math based on highly elliptical orbits, perihelion and solar energy per square meter over the entire pass.   I'm afraid to try myself, but it would be something less than the square of the distance due to the faster orbital speed for smaller perihelion.  </p>

<p>Wit this estimate in mind, Wikipedia says a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungrazing_comet"" rel=""nofollow"">sungrazing</a> comet with a perihelion of about 0.055 AU and an initial radius of about 2-3 km could survive that pass and be about 1 km.   That would be a loss of 1,000-2,000 KM over the pass, but that's a very close pass.</p>

<p>I think that's the start of an answer to this question.  The closer to the sun, the more meters of radius the comet will lose per orbit and calculating the radius losing so many meters every pass gives a rough estimate of the life of the comet.   Sublimation can begin as far away as the orbit of Saturn, but at that distance the sublimation is very slow.</p>

<p>-When looking up, you will see the light, as deep sea creatures do. The amount of light and its color will depend on how deep you are.</p>

<p>-When looking down, it should be dark (black), comparing to how it looks up. Otherwise, the atmosphere would be reflecting light.</p>

"""If earth had rings like Saturn"": A few further thoughts on the consequences","336","","<p>I came across this video recently where artists depicted what it would look like if Earth had rings like Saturn. <a href=""http://www.wimp.com/earthrings/"">http://www.wimp.com/earthrings/</a></p>

","<p>This is a big one, so I'll split it into parts based on the questions you asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Earth has roughly a distance of 1 AU to the sun, Saturn between 9 and 10. Sun's gravity would therefore have a much stronger influence on these rings. Would it already be enough to distort the rings (e.g. even leading to the sun ""stealing"" parts of it) or would the rings still have a ring shape?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sun would not have too much of an influence because the rings are all individually gravitationally bound to the earth (similar to the moon, and you don't see moon being affected by the sun, gravitationally; the rings will be much closer to the earth and hence even less affected).</p>

<p>The moon, on the other hand, would distort a few rings due to orbital resonances (similar to Titan Ringlets: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#Colombo_Gap_and_Titan_Ringlet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#Colombo_Gap_and_Titan_Ringlet</a> and resonant gaps in asteroid belts due to Jovian planets: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_gap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_gap</a>), and its effect would be much more pronounced because it is closer to the earth than Titan is to Saturn, though limited to a few resonant regions. There will also be ripples if the plane of the moon is different from the plane of the rings (<a href=""http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/11/saturns-rings-do-the-wave/#.U7VjpvmSw08"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/11/saturns-rings-do-the-wave/#.U7VjpvmSw08</a>).</p>

<p>Most matter in Saturn's ring is particles up to a few metres in size (<a href=""http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/FAQSaturn/#q6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/FAQSaturn/#q6</a>). Resolution of the human eye is about 1' (<a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/2398/is-the-moon-only-60-pixels"">Is the moon only 60 pixels?</a>), which means at a distance of around 1 to 1.5 Earth radii (given by Roche limit of the earth; this is where the rings will be), the eye can resolve things above a couple of kilometres in size. However, Saturn also has Shepherd moons, which are a few tens of kilometers in size. Such moons, if present, would be visible to naked eye. Also, the gaps would be visible clearly, since they are often big enough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3) Would those rings not be constantly raining particles down on
  earth? Would there be a much higher risk of dangerous impacts for the
  earth's population?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There would be collisions/interactions in the rings (I'm guessing, correct me if I'm wrong) which would send particles earthwards. However, the particles which will get thrown will be the lighter, smaller ones (conservation of momentum etc.), and usually small meteoroids are fairly harmless. They will also be slower than the usual meteoroids that enter the earth at above 20 km/s, since the orbital motion of the earth doesn't add up in this case. I am a little unsure about the consequences of them being slower, but anyway, smaller meteoroids should technically be fairly harmless. (Also I couldn't find decent references other than: <a href=""http://science.howstuffworks.com/question486.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://science.howstuffworks.com/question486.htm</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4) Are the colours used in the video precise? Don't they depend on the
  angle? What influence would our atmosphere have onto them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe so. This section shows true colour images of the rings from two different angles, and there doesn't seem to be a significant change in the colouration: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#Subdivisions_and_structures_within_the_rings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#Subdivisions_and_structures_within_the_rings</a>. The atmosphere will probably affect the rings closer to the horizon, with redder colouration similar to sunrise/sunset and moonrise/moonset.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5) Would those rings have the same orbital inclination or would theirs
  differ from earth's to an extent where the difference becomes visible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends largely on the formation history. This FAQ question here discusses this fairly well: <a href=""http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/FAQSaturn/#q14"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/FAQSaturn/#q14</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6) What shadow would these rings cause on earth? Would they be dense
  enough to ""shade out"" complete stretchs of land?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will be shadow similar to that due to clouds, since the rings are not too thick or dense. In many of the Cassini photos, you can see through the rings, so it is likely that the sunlight would still pass through, but would be dimmed (it would be interesting to see by what factor; I cannot say for sure with my knowledge). Also, remember that the earth will still be rotating but the ring system will be dynamically static, so there will be extended periods of darkness during the day for some regions at different times of the year.</p>

<p>I will add more to this if something comes to mind. I hope this was helpful.</p>

What we really have here is a motion of a test-particle ($m_1$ a.k.a the perturbed) around a massive object ($m_0$) in a binary system (with $m_2$). The inner orbit can be viewed as a Kepler orbit with a perturbation due to $m_2$ (a.k.a the perturber). Its parameters do change with time and are described by the Lidov-Kozai mechanism.</p>

<p>Using this model (which is probably what you're asking for):</p>

<p><strong>Question A</strong></p>

<p>The least massive object is the massless object $m_1$</p>

<p><strong>Question B</strong></p>

<p>What evolve are the parameters of the inner orbit ($m_0$ and $m_1$) - its eccentricity, inclination, angular momentum etc. How? in a periodic manner. The periodic change in the eccentricity literally means that the inner orbit becomes more circular, then more eccentric, then more circular again and again.
The eccentricity-inclination change is easier to see because of the following constant of motion:</p>

<p>$$\sqrt{1-e^2}\cos i = const. $$</p>

<p>(It is not exactly $L_z$, but a scaled version of it $\frac{L_z}{\mu\sqrt{GMa_{in}}}$. $\mu,M$ being the reduced and total mass of the inner orbit respectively)</p>

<p>The fact of this being constant is not easy to see, but if given as a fact and the fact the $e$ is periodic, you can see that the inclination $i$ is periodic.</p>

<p><strong>Question C</strong></p>

<p>When deriving this model one is ""averaging"" out (over one full period) the true-anomaly (the exact position of the mass inside the orbit) of $m_1$ around $m_0$ -> meaning we refer to the inner orbit as an ""elliptic ring"", and the same goes for the outer orbit. In this ""2-rings"" model the semi-major axis of the inner orbit/ring is set to be fixed, therefore the energy of the inner orbit is fixed (easy to see from the relation $E=-\frac{Gm_0*m_1}{2a}$)</p>

<p>Generally speaking (without any averaging) - this is still a chaotic 3-body problem and everything can happen - the inner orbit might just completely be destroyed by m1 being thrown out of the system, for an instance.</p>

<p>But if there are an infinite number of these universes then surely the gravitational force we would feel would be infinite?</p>
","<p>An exact answer would require a rather specific and mathematical formulation of the multiverse in consideration.</p>

<p>As a simple approximating example, suppose we have a countably infinite number of (observable) universes of the same mass $M$.  Suppose the dimension of the full multiverse is one higher than each individual universe, and suppose the universes are all separated by the same minimum distance $\epsilon&gt;0$ from each other.  In a 2-D picture, this would just look like a bunch of parallel lines all separated by the same distance.</p>

<p>Pick your home universe and put an observer.  Another universe of distance $n\epsilon$ away (meaning they're $n$ universes up or down from you in the 2-D picture) exerts a gravitational force on the observer in its direction approximately proportional to $\displaystyle{\frac{M}{n^2\epsilon^2}}.$  With the right units, we can just say ""approximately"".</p>

<p>The maximum gravitational force occurs when the observer is at the bottom (or top) of the picture, and all over universes are above it (or below): universes on each side will pull in opposing directions and so lead to cancellations.  So the net gravitational force from the other universes (in the right units) is at most 
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{M}{n^2\epsilon^2} = \frac{M}{\epsilon^2}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2 M}{6\epsilon^2}&lt;\infty.$$</p>

<p>The important factor is that Jupiter is moving, quite fast.  About 13 km/s.   The other important factor is that Jupiter is very massive, so it has a lot of gravity and it can draw objects towards it, causing their direction to bend.</p>

<p>The tricky concept for a 6 year old is that gravity is a zero-sum game.   The object that falls towards Jupiter, in this case it's a hyperbolic orbit but regular orbits work too, so as it falls towards it, it adds velocity then flying away from it, it loses the same amount of velocity, so the net velocity relative to Jupiter is zero.  No change.</p>

<p>But because Jupiter is moving, Jupiter can tug the spacecraft along with it.  The velocity relative to Jupiter is unchanged but the velocity relative to the sun changes, Jupiter is like the train that the ball bounces off of.   </p>

<p>The opposite can happen too.   Jupiter can be used to slow a spacecraft down. It depends on the angle of approach, like throwing a ball against a train while it moves away from you.</p>

<p>You can also do this experiment below (with 2 balls not 3 to represent the gravity assist, though it's a cooler experiment with 3).  It's the same principal.   Bouncing off a moving object (Jupiter) is very different than bounding off a flat surface that isn't moving.</p>

"Is there a flaw with the newer purposes and correlations attributed to the HR diagram? (And would a third axis of mass correct the enclosed flaw?)","332","","<p>When I was younger, I was looking at HR diagrams, and began to experiment with the HR diagram. </p>

<p>I was looking at plotting different groups of stars on the HR diagram when I found RV Tauri stars.</p>

<p>These are stars between 0.4 and 9 solar masses; they have reached the end of their ""life"" and the fusion shell of such a swollen star is advancing towards its surface (when it hits, the planetary nebula starts to form), thus its heats up and swells further. This phase occurs after the Asymptotic Giant Branch/Red Clump phases (AGB for high-metallicity stars, RC for low-metallicity stars).</p>

<p>Taking into account the above information, RV Tauri stars are BOTH more luminous and hotter at the surface than red giants (and AGB/RC stars), they should appear to the upper-left of the latter of the aforementioned groups (given the inversion of the temperature axis). All seemed well.</p>

<p>But then I saw this:</p>

<p>My knowledge of astrophysics tells me that due to stellar winds and the equation E=MC^2, a star's mass (after ""birth"") will usually decrease over time (unless receiving matter from another star). But if RV Tauri stars are above and to the left of red giants, it means that according to the graph, an increase in mass occurs every time a star migrates to the RV Tauri stage.</p>

<p>I know that all graphs have their limitations, but in my mind it was wrong to claim that these correlations were set in stone. Only axes could ever display data in a perfect way (they treat different units of data as separate simple measures, not ""more unstable"" compound measures). So I added a third axis of mass (as this is whole problem is to do with plotting the evolutionary ""tracks"" of stars); this is what is known to affect stellar evolution to the greatest extent.

<p>But this does not mean that there is a flaw in the H-R diagram. It is correct as it is: it displays Luminosity Vs. Color and is perfect at that. And then it happens that some extra relations appear: stars are not randomly scattered on the HR diagram, but they group in branches, and these branches are related to stages of their life. The position on each branch is related to each star's mass. This is not a general relation holding for all the diagram. Almost the same happens with size, but this is more tightly related to Luminosity, per definition.</p>

","<p>Main sequence stars are defined by being hot enough in the core to fuse hydrogen, so their core is at least about 10 million K, and can get up to 20 million K for the more massive ones (because they are more luminous, so their nuclear fusion has to crank itself up a bit more).   </p>

<p>The way they get their cores hot enough to fuse hydrogen is via gravitational contraction, but a more massive star does not need to contract as much to reach the necessary temperature.   Since it does not need to contract as much, it is at lower density.  </p>

<p>To see the scaling approximately, use the virial theorem, which says that the energy per particle in the core (roughly set by the need for fusion) is about $GMm/R$, where $M$ is the mass of the star, and $m$ is the mass of a proton.  Expressed in terms of density $\rho$ instead of radius $R$, that's proportional to $M^{\frac{2}{3}}\rho^{\frac{1}{3}}$.  Ergo, $\rho$ drops when $M$ rises.</p>

Even some discussions about terra forming Mars mention that within a few million years, perhaps, the atmosphere would drift off into space.</p>

<p>So how can we be so certain that's the limits of the zones, especially with Mars? If Mars was as large as Earth/Venus and could hold on to a thicker atmosphere and thus retain more heat, then wouldn't that automatically push out the Goldilocks Zone? It seems like the edges have been places arbitrarily without consideration as to <em>why</em> they're the edges instead of ""they just are.""

The speaker says that this could cause ocean tides on the planets.  Are they close enough that the tidal forces could heat the interior of the planets?</p>
","<p>This is a complicated question that would really require a full physics simulation and better knowledge of the system to accurately answer. But let's try a few back of the envelope calculations to see what we get.</p>

<h3>Calculating tidal forces from TRAPPIST-1c on TRAPPIST-1b</h3>

<p>I'm going to calculate the tidal effects of TRAPPIST-1c on TRAPPIST-1b (simply because, a priori, this seems likely to be where the strongest tidal heating will be induced). See the figure below which describes the parameters.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g1qj4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g1qj4.png"" alt=""Diagram of setup""></a></p>

<p>The tidal force of 1c on 1b is defined as the differential force of gravity across 1b, that is, the difference of the force of gravity on the side of 1b facing towards 1c and the force of gravity on the side of 1b facing away from 1c. Mathematically, we get.</p>

<p>$$F_{tide,c-b} = F_{g,-R_b} - F_{g,+R_b} = \frac{GM_bM_c}{(D-R_b)^2} - \frac{GM_bM_c}{(D+R_b)^2} = 4GM_bM_c\frac{DR_b}{(D^2-R_b^2)^2}$$</p>

<p>We can presume that $R_b &lt;&lt; D$ (for this case $R_b/D = 1\%$) and reduce this to</p>

<p>$$F_{tide,c-b}(D) \approx 4GM_bM_c\frac{R_b}{D^3}$$</p>

<p>But this isn't enough to determine the amount of tidal heating that may occur. Tidal heating only occurs when the tidal force <em>changes</em>. It is this constantly changing tidal force which results in tidal flexing of the planet and thus creating heat through tidal friction. Fortunately, for these two planets, the tidal force will be changing since $D$ will be constantly changing. So let's calculate $F_{tide}$ for the two extremes where these planets are as close as possible and as far as possible and difference them.</p>

<p>$$\Delta F_{tide,c-b} = F_{tide}(0.004\:\mathrm{AU}) - F_{tide}(0.026\:\mathrm{AU})$$</p>

<p>If I plug in numbers to this, I find that</p>

<p>$$\Delta F_{tide,c-b} \approx 3.7\times10^{20}\:\mathrm{N}$$</p>

<p>Okay, but what do we do with this number? It's somehow a metric of the change in tidal forcing that 1c imparts on 1b, but is it negligible? To determine this, we have to compare it to something. Let's compare this to the tidal forcing that TRAPPIST-1b would receive from the star.</p>

<h3>Calculating tidal forces from TRAPPIST-1 on TRAPPIST-1b</h3>

<p>I've already set up the math, so we don't need to go over that again. But first, let me discuss where this tidal forcing is actually coming from. Quoting an <a href=""http://www.space.com/35790-seven-earth-size-planets-trappist-1-discovery.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article from space.com</a>, the paper's author, Gillon, states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because the seven alien worlds orbit so tightly, they're probably all tidally locked, Gillon said. That is, they likely always show the same face to their host star, just as Earth's moon only shows the ""near side"" to us. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said above, the only way to produce tidal heating is to have changing tidal forces. These planets are likely synchronized and always present the same side to the star. It's marginally possible these planets aren't perfectly tidally locked, but rather have some higher spin-orbit resonance. That is, their spin orbit resonance might not be 1:1 (as it would be if they were tidally locked) but instead could be something like 3:2 (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)#Spin.E2.80.93orbit_resonance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">which is what Mercury has</a>). I'll ignore that complication though and just assume 1:1 resonance. So if they're tidally locked, they can't experience differing tidal forces through their own rotation. Instead, the differential tidal forcing comes from the orbit's ellipticity. Sometimes the planet will be closer and sometimes it will be farther, causing a differential tidal force on TRAPPIST-1b from the star as it orbits. This is exactly what occurs in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_heating_of_Io"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tidal heating of Io</a>. Let's calculate $\Delta F_{tide,*-b}$ by using the varying distances TRAPPIST-1b will have from the star. I found that TRAPPIST-1b will orbit between $0.0101\:\mathrm{AU}$ and $0.0119\:\mathrm{AU}$<sup>1</sup>. This means the differential tidal force is:</p>

<p>$$\Delta F_{tide,*-b} \approx 4GM_bM_*R_b\left(\frac{1}{(0.0119\:\mathrm{AU})^3} - \frac{1}{(0.0101\:\mathrm{AU})^3}\right) = 1.8\times10^{23}\:\mathrm{N}$$</p>

<h3>Is planetary tidal heating non-negligible?</h3>

<p>The back of the envelope calculations show that the differential tidal force on TRAPPIST-1b from TRAPPIST-1c is about $0.2\%$ of the differential tidal force due to the star. Whether you consider this negligible or not is up to you. I'd personally consider it a pretty small effect and say that most of the tidal heating these planets experience comes from the star itself.</p>

<h3>Could the inter-planetary tidal heating still contribute to the tidal heating of the planets enough to heat the interior?</h3>

<p>This is a remarkably hard question to answer and I can't even really do a back of the envelope calculation without making wild, unjustifiable assumptions. The calculations above simply determined the maximum tidal force variation over time. That doesn't tell us anything about how much tidal heating this may induce though. That requires knowing more about the planet itself, in particular the planet's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_number"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Love numbers</a> which define the rigidity of the body and thus how easy it is to stretch via differential tidal forces. You can vary your tidal forcing as much as you want, but if your planet is pure iron (and thus very rigid) you're unlikely to have as much of an effect as if it were primarily silicate (and thus much less rigid). The paper produces the plot below which defines the potential constituents of each planet. This would be a first step in determining the planet rigidities, but as you can see from the error bars, it would be highly uncertain.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IaIUl.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IaIUl.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>Overall, and this is entirely opinion based and from my calculations above, but I'd say the chances of the inter-planetary tidal heating having significant effects on the interior heat of of these planets is negligible. More than likely the biggest contributing factor is radioactive decay, followed by tidal heating from the star (but this is amplified by the eccentric orbits induced by planetary gravitational perturbations)</strong></p>
