"What does 5' and 3' mean in DNA and RNA strands?","252609","","<p>What are 5' and 3' in DNA and RNA strands? Please clarify with some images and please use simple English.</p>
","<p>The 5' and 3' mean ""five prime"" and ""three prime"", which indicate the carbon numbers in the DNA's sugar backbone. The 5' carbon has a phosphate group attached to it and the 3' carbon a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This asymmetry gives a DNA strand a ""direction"". For example, DNA polymerase works in a 5' -> 3' direction, that is, it adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the molecule (the -OH group is not shown in diagram), thus advancing to that direction (downwards).</p>

"Why is DNA replication  performed in the 5' to 3' direction?","206969","","<p>DNA replication goes in the 5' to 3' direction because DNA polymerase acts on the 3'-OH of the existing strand for adding free nucleotides. Is there any biochemical reason why all organisms evolved to go from 5' to 3'? </p>

<p>Are there any energetic/resource advantages to using 5' to 3'? Is using the 3'-OH of the existing strand to attach the phosphate of the free nucleotide more energetically favorable than using the 3'-OH of the free nucleotide to attach the phosphate of the existing strand? Does it take more resources to create a 3' to 5' polymerase?</p>
","<p>Prof. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%3aAgathman"">Allen Gathman</a> has a great 10-minutes <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4hKibS2fAo"">video</a> on Youtube, explaining the reaction of adding nucleotide in the 5' to 3' direction, and why it doesn't work the other way.</p>

<p>Briefly, the energy for the formation of the phosphodiester bond comes from the dNTP, which has to be added. dNTP is a nucleotide which has two additional phosphates attached to its 5' end. In order to join the 3'OH group with the phosphate of the next nucleotide, one oxygen has to be removed from this phosphate group. This oxygen is also attached to two extra phosphates, which are also attached to a Mg++. Mg++ pulls up the electrons of the oxygen, which weakens this bond and the so called nucleophilic attack of the oxygen from the 3'OH succeeds, thus forming the phospodiester bond.</p>

<p>If you try to join the dNTP's 3'OH group to the 5' phosphate of the next nucleotide, there won't be enough energy to weaken the bond between the oxygen connected to the 5' phosphorous (the other two phosphates of the dNTP are on the 5' end, not on the 3' end), which makes the nucleophilic attack harder.</p>

"Why do I only breathe out of one nostril?","177210","","<p>I was just sitting with my hand next to my nose and I realized that air was only coming out of the right nostril. Why is that? I would think I would use both, it seems much more efficient. Have I always only been breathing out of my right nostril?</p>
","<p>Apparently you're not the first person to notice this; in 1895, a German nose specialist called Richard Kayser found that we have tissue called erectile tissue in our noses (yes, it is very similar to the tissue found in a penis). This tissue swells in one nostril and shrinks in the other, creating an open airway via only one nostril. What's more, he found that this is indeed a 'nasal cycle', changing every 2.5 hours or so. Of course, the other nostril isn't completely blocked, just mostly. If you try, you can feel a very light push of air out of the blocked nostril.  </p>

<p>This is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. You can change which nostril is closed and which is open by laying on one side to open the opposite one.  </p>

<p>Interestingly, some researchers think that this is the reason we often switch the sides we lay on during sleep rather regularly, as it is more comfortable to sleep on the side with the blocked nostril downwards.  </p>

<p>As to why we don't breathe through both nostrils simultaneously, I couldn't find anything that explains it.  </p>

"Why can white hairs get dark again?","166449","","<p>I have learned (probably in high school?) that hairs turning white is caused by the part of the folicle which produces the pigment dying and being replaced by an air bubble. This sounds very irreversible. </p>

<p>I have long dark brown hair, and since I turned 25, I have had a few white hairs here and there. It is not unusual to find hairs which have a dark tip but are white at the root, which fits the above theory. </p>

<p>But I also have hairs which are the opposite: the lower ten centimeters are pure white, but at some point, there is an abrupt transition to dark brown, and the hair is dark again up to the root. This is all a natural phenomenon, I haven't used dyes or bleaches. </p>

<p>So what makes white hair white, if it can turn back to dark? Why would a single hair turn back? </p>
","<p>The pigmentation of hairs is achieved by the follicular melanocytes (specialized pigment cells) at the base of the hair shaft. These cells produce the pigment which is subsequently transported into the cells which produce the hair and integrated into the hair matrix.</p>

<p>Besides genetic reasons, there are two major ways of loosing this pigmentation. First, as a part of the normal <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_hair_growth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hair cycle</a>, the hair grows for a while until it falls out and the hair follicle regresses. In this process the cells in the hair follicle die, including which made the hair as well as of the melanocytes. In this step of the hair cycle the hair follicle changes its morphology. When a new haircycle starts, the pigment cells in the hair follicle are replenished from a stem cell population called melanocyte stem cells. These cells are located in the hair bulge (marked in red in the figure below). The cells then start to proliferate to multiply their number. Few of these cells stay stem cells (to be able to repopulate the pigment cells after the next hair cycle) other differentiate into melanocytes which subsequently migrate towards the bottom of the hair bulb (shown in green in the figure). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5tFDA.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Over time, the number of stem cells gets lower and at some point, there are none left. This leads to a situation where the pigment cells are not replenished at the beginning of a new hair cycle and the hair stays unpigmented. As this is a continous process, the pigmentation gets weaker before it is completely lost. As far as this process is understood to date, this depigmentation is irreversible.</p>

<p>There are two very interesting papers about this topic:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286740500293X"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Melanocyte Stem Cell Maintenance and Hair Graying</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23018363"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Melanocyte stem cells: biology and current aspects.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The other reason for loosing pigmentation (temporarily or permanent) is the generation of so called ""reactive oxygen species"" (Hydrogenperoxide) in the cells of the hair follice, which then destroy the pigment. This is basically the same reaction which is used to bleach hairs, but in this instance from inside. This reaction can have numerous reasons, among them are vitiligo and stress. The reason for the build-up of the hydrogenperoxides is that enzymes, which usually break them down before they can cause harm are either mutated or downregulated. If the level of these enzymes (the catalases) goes back to normal, pigmentation is also getting back to normal. This has been tested experimentally with people which suffer from the pigmentation disease vitiligo.</p>

"What's the maximum and minimum temperature a human can survive?","166009","","<p>This is a question that has been in my mind since I was a kid. I'm not a doctor, nor even a biology student, just a curious person. What is the minimum and maximum temperature a human body can stand without dying or suffering severe consequences (eg. a burn or a freeze)? While at this subject, how much more global warming will the human body be able to take? Seeing as temperatures keep on rising, I'm just wondering how much longer until the temperature starts having drastic effects.</p>

<p>In my country the temperature is about 35-40-45 degrees Celsius in mid-summer (I live in Romania, eastern Europe, and the climate is supposedly ideal here) which is very unhealthy. Does the human body suffer more and more as the temperatures change?</p>
","<p><strong>Hypothermia</strong> (when the body is too cold) is said to occur when the core body temperature of an individual has dropped below 35° celsius.  Normal core body temperature is 37°C. (<a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Hypothermia/Pages/Causes.aspx"">1</a>) Hypothermia is then further subdivided into levels of seriousness (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"">2</a>) (although all can be damaging to health if left for an extended period of time)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mild 35–32 °C</strong>: <em>shivering, vasoconstriction, liver failure (which would eventually be fatal) or hypo/hyper-glycemia (problems maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, both of which could eventually be fatal)</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate 32–28 °C:</strong> <em>pronounced shivering, sufficient vasoconstriction to induce shock, cyanosis in extremities &amp; lips (i.e. they turn blue), muscle mis-coordination becomes more apparent</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Severe 28–20 °C:</strong> <em>this is where your body would start to rapidly give up.  Heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure fall to dangerous levels (HR of 30bpm would not be uncommon - normally around 70-100).  Multiple organs fail and clinical death (where the heart stops beating and breathing ceases) soon occurs</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>However, as with most things in human biology, there is a wide scope for variation between individuals. The Swedish media reports the case of a seven year old girl recovering from hypothermia of 13°C (<a href=""http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=4296666"">3</a>) (though children are often more resilient than adults).</p>

<p><strong>Hyperthermia</strong> (when the body is too hot - known in its acute form as heatstroke) and is medically defined as a core body temperature from 37.5–38.3 °C <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"">(4)</a>.  A body temperature of above 40°C is likely to be fatal due to the damage done to enzymes in critical biochemical pathways (e.g. respiratory enzymes).</p>

<p>As you mentioned <strong>burns</strong>, I will go into these too. Burns are a result of contact with a hot object or through infra-red (heat) radiation. Contact with hot liquid is referred to as a scald rather than a burn. Tests on animals showed that burns from hot objects start to take effect when the object is at least 50°C and the heat applied for over a minute. (<a href=""http://ep.physoc.org/content/32/1/67"">5</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Freeze-burn/frostbite</strong>, which is harder to heal than heat burns(<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1345616/"">6</a>) occurs when vaso-constriction progresses to the degree where blood flow to affected areas is virtually nil.  The tissue affected will eventually literally freeze, causing cell destruction. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite"">7</a>)  Similarly to hypothermia, frostbite is divided into four degrees (that can be viewed on Wikipedia).</p>

<p>As to the matter of global warming cooking us to death, I would imagine that it would be more indirect changes that got us first.  If the average temperature had risen  to the necessary 40°C to cause heat-stroke, sea levels would have risen hugely due to the melting of the polar ice caps.  Crops and other food sources would likely be affected too, therefore I don't think that global warming is overly likely to <em>directly</em> kill humans.</p>

"Why do vaccines cause your arm to hurt?","118832","","<p>When you get a shot for a vaccine (for example, the annual flu vaccine), the nurse frequently indicates that your arm will ache for a day or two, maybe more. This ache is typically not just a pain from having your skin punctured, but is actually an ache of the entire arm.</p>

<p>What mechanism causes the entire arm to ache from a vaccine? Why doesn't that ache extend to other parts of the body, like the hands or the shoulders? Why do non-vaccine arm punctures (such as drawing blood, injecting drugs) not cause the ache?</p>
","<p>The goal of the vaccine is to provoke an immune response, therefore some degree of inflammation is expected in order for the vaccine to work. As swbarnes2 says, vaccines contain adjuvants, pro-inflammatory molecules that produces local inflammation and recruits immune cells to the site of the inoculation.</p>

<p>Since you get the shot intramuscularily, intradermally or subcutaneously, it is local, and the inflammation does not spread. The reason why your whole arm seems to hurt (rather than the place where the vaccine was deposited) is, I think, that where you got your shot, you have not many pain receptors, and your brain is not able to determine the pain source very exactly.</p>

","<p>It's pretty simple. A reaction occurs that releases energy (like ATP losing a phosphate to become ADP + Pi). If this is uncoupled, the energy will merely turn into heat. If it is coupled, then it can be used to fuel some other process. For instance, if you couple the ATP -> ADP reaction to a certain protein, the energy can be used to modify the shape of that protein.</p>

"Teens concerned about impregnation through clothes","109405","","<p><strong>Dry Humping</strong>, is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>dry humping is the process of two people repeatedly moving up and down and back and forth on top of each other fully clothed( or missing various pieces, but the penis must not come in contact with the vagina with out some sort of fabric separating them ex: boxers,panties, or even sheets!!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all know that the basic rule for impregnation is that the sperm must come in contact with the egg, and even be able to fertilize it. While sperm can get through clothes, semen (but this is yet been proven or disproved) gets stuck, thus the sperm dies.</p>

<p>What is your opinion about this? If two people are on top of each other, fully clothed, and the male comes to ejaculation, is there any chance that pregnancy can happen, in the <strong>realistic</strong> and biological look at it (and not some probability or statistical way)? What advice should be given to teens on the matter?</p>

<p>I am a computer scientist with no biology knowledge, and am very interested in getting the opinion of biologists.</p>

<p>But since I know that the stackexchange community likes to see work done before asking questions, I did my own research (I am used to googling code and algorithms):
Very few research has been done on the subject. There is one shining research that  concluded, as I recall, that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the underwear is <strong>completely saturated</strong> with semen, and is in <strong>direct</strong> contact with the woman's vagina, pregnancy is <strong>possible</strong> statistically, but <strong>highly unlikely</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>If there has been an ejaculation by the male, and semen is present, there is a chance of getting pregnant. Period. Teens really need to know that.</p>

<p>I think you may have your terms confused - semen is the overall fluid released during an ejaculation, sperm are the cells with tails that are produced in the testes and fertilize the egg. At any rate, according to the WHO, a normal sperm count is over 15 million per milliliter, with some counts much higher (>50e6/ml ), and an average between 20 and 40 million. The volume of the ejeculate tends to be anywhere from 1-6 ml. If you take a healthy young male at the peak of his reproductive capabilities, this equates to a very large number of sperm being released during a sexual encounter. All it takes is for one to reach an egg and fertilize it. Sperm are very very small, much smaller than the pore size of average fabric, so clothing will do very little to stop them. The female is likely sexually aroused during this activity as well, and produces additional fluids and lubricants that promote the survival and motility of sperm, among other things.</p>

<p>So, it depends on many factors. If both parties are fully clothed (at least 4 layers of clothing between their respective reproductive organs) and there is a minumum of soaking through, the chances of pregnancy are correspondingly quite low. On the other hand, if only one partner is wearing just their underwear, it's essentially like there is no clothing present at all, and the relative chances go up significantly.</p>

<p>Safe sex practices can't be emphasized enough to young people, as education and awareness is so much better than ignorance and myths. Even aside from pregnancy, if condoms are not utilized properly to contain all the semen there is the chance of sexually-transmitted diseases, ranging from herpes and gonorrhea to AIDS. None of these require penetration to be passed along, and one might argue that the additional presence of potentially irritating fabrics could open up raw areas or cuts and enhance their transmittal.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Take home message</h2>

<p>Now, all this being said, the chances of impregnation through clothing without direct penetration of the penis into the vagina is quite low compared to ""typical"" unprotected fully-penetrating intercourse, especially depending on where the female is in her fertility cycle. According to <a href=""http://www.demographic-research.org/Volumes/Vol3/5/default.htm"">this study</a>, a woman's most fertile day is two days before ovulation (as had been postulated before), and the chances of pregnancy on that day are about 25% (assuming penetrating intercourse). Overall, the chance of pregnancy throughout the month is about 5%. </p>

<p>I don't have any hard numbers on the pregnancy chances when one or both partners have at least some clothing on, as obviously it will vary greatly depending on who is wearing what, the volume of ejaculate, contact time after ejaculation, etc. Just for fun, let's assume it's 100 times lower. That means the chances of impregnation two days pre-ovulation would be 0.25%, or 1 in 400. While rather low, this is still a non-zero chance. </p>

<p>Condoms are about 98% effective if used properly during penetrative vaginal intercourse. Various other birth control methods such as contraceptive pills, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective on their own, although they do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. I'm certainly not one for preaching abstinence, but done properly it should be 100% effective. Ultimately, it is up to both partners to decide what their risk tolerances are, together. It is much better to seriously talk about it beforehand than to be panicked and unsure afterwards.</p>

"Why do mammalian red blood cells lack a nucleus?","107243","","<p>How did the red blood cell in humans get to lose its nucleus (and other organelles)? Does the bone marrow just not put the nucleus in, or is it stripped out at some stage in the construction of the cell?</p>
","<p>Red blood cells are initially produced in the bone marrow with a nucleus. They then undergo a process known as enucleation in which their nucleus is removed. Enucleation occurs roughly when the cell has reached maturity. According to one research (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/ncb/journal/v10/n3/abs/ncb1693.html"">Ji, <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>), the way this occurs in mice is that a ring of actin filaments surrounds the cell, and then contracts. This cuts off a segment of the cell containing the nucleus, which is then swallowed by a macrophage. Enucleation in humans most likely follows a very similar mechanism.</p>

<p>The absence of a nucleus is an adaptation of the red blood cell for its role. It allows the red blood cell to contain more hemoglobin and, therefore, carry more oxygen molecules. It also allows the cell to have its distinctive bi-concave shape which aids diffusion. This shape would not be possible if the cell had a nucleus in the way. Because of the advantages it gives, it is easy to see why evolution would cause this to occur. However, since little is known about the genes the control enucleation, it is still not a fully understood process.             </p>

"What is the difference between orthologs, paralogs and homologs?","93883","","<p>These three terms are often misused in the literature. Many researchers seem to treat them as synonyms. So, what is the definition of each of these terms and how do they differ from one another?</p>
","<p>First, a note on spelling. Both ""ortholog"" and ""orthologue"" are correct, one is the American and the other the British spelling. The same is true for homolog and paralog.</p>

<p>On to the biology. Homology is the blanket term, both ortho- and paralogs are homologs. <strong>So, when in doubt use ""homologs"".</strong> However:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Orthologs are homologous genes that are the result of a <strong>speciation event</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Paralogs are homologous genes that are the result of a <strong>duplication event</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following image, adapted (slightly) from [<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vpbDk.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">1</a>], illustrates the differences:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vpbDk.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Part <strong>(a)</strong> of the diagram above shows a hypothetical evolutionary history of a gene. The ancestral genome had two copies of this gene (A and B) which were <strong>paralogs</strong>. At some point, the ancestral species split into two daughter species, each of whose genome contains two copies of the ancestral duplicated gene (A1,A2 and B1,B2). </p>

<p>These genes are all homologous to one another but are they paralogs or orthologs? Since the duplication event that created genes A and B occurred before the speciation event that created species 1 and 2, A genes will be paralogs of B genes and 1 genes will be orthologs of 2 genes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A1 and B1 are <strong>paralogs</strong></li>
<li>A1 and B2 are <strong>paralogs</strong>.</li>
<li>A2 and B1 are <strong>paralogs</strong>.</li>
<li><p>A2 and B2 are <strong>paralogs</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>A1 and A2 are <strong>orthologs</strong>.</p></li>
<li>B1 and B2 are <strong>orthologs</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This however, is a very simple case. What happens when a duplication occurs <em>after</em> a speciation event? In part <strong>(b)</strong> of the above diagram, the ancestral gene was duplicated <em>only</em> in species 2's lineage. Therefore, in <strong>(b)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>A2 and B2 are <strong>orthologs</strong> of A1.</li>
<li>A2 and B2 are <strong>paralogs</strong> of each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>A common misconception is that paralogous genes are those homologous genes that are in the same genome while orthologous genes are those that are in different genomes. As you can see in the example above, this is absolutely not true. While it <em>can</em> happen that way, ortho- vs paralogy depends exclusively on the evolutionary history of the genes involved. If you do not know whether a particular homology relationship is the result of a gene duplication or a speciation event, then you <strong>cannot know</strong> if it is a case of paralogy or orthology. </p>

"Why is thymine rather than uracil used in DNA?","92140","","<p>What is the advantage gained by the substitution of thymine for uracil in DNA?  I have read previously that it is due to thymine being ""better protected"" and therefore more suited to the storage role of DNA, which seems fine in theory, but why does the addition of a simple methyl group make the base more well protected?</p>
","<p>One major problem with using uracil as a base is that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deamination#Cytosine"">cytosine can be deaminated</a>, which converts it into uracil. This is not a rare reaction; it happens around 100 times per cell, per day. This is no major problem when using thymine, as the cell can easily recognize that the uracil doesn't belong there and can repair it by substituting it by a cytosine again. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7vV8J.png"" alt=""cytosine deamination""></p>

<p>There is an enzyme, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_glycosylase#Uracil_DNA_glycosylases"">uracil DNA glycosylase</a>, that does exactly that; it excises uracil bases from double-stranded DNA. It can safely do that as uracil is not supposed to be present in the DNA and has to be the result of a base modification.</p>

<p>Now, if we would use uracil in DNA it would not be so easy to decide how to repair that error. It would prevent the usage of this important repair pathway.</p>

<p>The inability to repair such damage doesn't matter for RNA as the mRNA is comparatively short-lived and any potential errors don't lead to any lasting damage. It matters a lot for DNA as the errors are continued through every replication. Now, this explains why there is an advantage to using thymine in DNA, it doesn't explain why RNA uses uracil. I'd guess it just evolved that way and there was no significant drawback that could be selected against, but there might be a better reason (more difficult biosynthesis of thymine, maybe?).</p>

"What could cause hairs to gray at the tips but not the roots?","91665","","<p>I have noticed that some of my sporadic gray hairs are gray at the tip side but oddly, not near the roots.  Some are even only gray in the middle.  I find all of this very counter intuitive, and I assure you nobody is secretly dying my hair.</p>

<p>How does the graying process work, and how is it that this can be happening?</p>
","<p>Interesting question, I am not sure if I have a definite answer, but at least some ideas:
The pigment in the hair is made by specialized cells, the melanocytes. The make the pigment (eumelanin=dark and pheomelanin=red/yellowish) which is then deposited into the growing hair. They are located at the bottom of hair bulb and usually die at the end of each hair cycle. To have the hair of the next hair cycle colored as well, this melanocyte population in the hair bulb needs to be replenished. This is done by melanocate stem cells, which live in the hair bulge and which start to reproduce and differentiate in melanocyte which then migrate down to the hair bulb. There is an excellent article following this process:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15618488"" rel=""nofollow"">Mechanisms of hair graying: incomplete melanocyte stem cell
maintenance in the niche.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The hair later gets grey (low pigment) and white (no pigment) when these melanocytes are not, or not fulley replenished in later hair cycles. Why this happens, there are a few hypothesis. </p>

<p>First, its possible, that with age the melanocyte stem cell population (which not only need to replenish the melanocytes, but also need to maintain its own population) is getting smaller and disappears over time. This process would explain gradually graying over time. See this reference:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15820674"" rel=""nofollow"">Melanocyte stem cell maintenance and hair graying.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Another possibility is the presence of reactive oxigen species (ROS) which occur naturally in melanocytes. Over time, the enzyme which intercepts this ROS (catalase) is getting less active or present in the cells and thus oxidative damage is getting bigger, damaging the melanocytes and their ability to make pigment. It would actually bleach itself...</p>

hair color by blunting methionine sulfoxide repair</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Melanin has also an important role in intercepting ROS, so in this process less and less pigment is made (as the damage accumulates) and this also leads to hair, which is less pigmented for exogeneous oxidative stress:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16723385"" rel=""nofollow"">Towards a ""free radical theory of graying"": melanocyte apoptosis in
the aging human hair follicle is an indicator of oxidative stress

</ul>

<p>It could be possible (and this is a wild guess) that the phenomenon of the tips graying first is situated by this. Hair less protected against exogeneous oxidative stress (smoke, UV etc.) so the melanin is ""used up"" during this until the hair greys at the tip, since its the oldest and most exposed part of the hair.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>There are multiple online reports of ""drowning fleas"" and killing them with soapy water.  After looking for the science there does not seem to be much support for these fatal claims. There is little doubt that giving your pet a soapy bath in the tub will help remove the fleas, they may even appear dead.  But in all likelihood these fleas are just waiting to dry out and be revived, hopefully in the city sewer.  If you bath your pet in the yard, and than let the dry pet in the yard again the next day the clean pet and clean revived fleas will likely reunite. Soapy water is more likely to facilitate removal of the comatose flea from the pet and carry it down the drain. So it is reasonable to have noticeable decrease in the flea population after a bath.  But <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/196/"">excessive bathing has it's own risks</a> and given the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea#Life_cycle_and_habitat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">life cycle of a flea</a> soapy baths alone are unlikely to be a final solution.</p>

"Why Do Healing Wounds Feel Warmer To The Touch?","79110","","<p>I fell over on my bicycle trying to avoid running over a rattlesnake, and ended up badly skinning my knee. It immediately began to bleed, but soon clotted.</p>

<p>It has been <strong>2 days</strong> now and it has formed a thin scab and is healing well as far as I can tell. I was chilly from the air conditioning, and I noticed the wounded knee was much warmer than the healthy knee. It was very warm, while the other was rather cold to the touch.</p>

<p>I read <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/8741/1827"">here</a> about skin healing, and thought, maybe it is because the blood rushed there to clot the wound. But, the wound is already clotted and sealed and the worst is over. So my question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is my wound and the area around it so much warmer <em>days</em> after the injury?</li>
</ul>
","<p>This is a normal part of the inflammatory process. Inflammation is your body's localised defensive response to tissue injury of any kind, and it is characterised by four cardinal signs- redness, swelling, heat and pain (severe inflammation involves a fifth, loss of function). </p>

<p>Your body is performing three main processes here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mobilisation of the body's defences.</p>

<p>Involves release of vasoactive chemicals, which cause the blood vessels to dilate and increase blood flow to the area. This causes the pain and heat, The blood vessels also produce cell-adhesion molecules which make immune cells (leukocytes) stick to the walls of the your blood vessels.</p></li>
<li><p>Containment and destruction of pathogens.</p>

<p>The immune system then goes to work clearing up any bacteria which have got into the wound. The leukocytes release chemicals called cytokines to attract more immune cells, to contain and destroy bacteria.</p></li>
<li><p>Tissue cleanup and repair.</p>

<p>Dead cells, cell fluid and other debris (pus) is then absorbed by the lymphatic system. Platelets and endothelial cells then secrete growth factors which stimulate cells called fibroblasts to multiply and produce collagen. The heat also increases metabolic rate and increases the rate of tissue repair.</p></li>

"Deciding between chi square and t test","75866","","<p>I am always so confused whether to do a chi square test or a t test in the sums given by my biostats teacher. Does anyone have a simple rule to decide this?</p>
","<p>This is a very subtle question and I encourage you to read the Wikipedia articles on these different subjects (t-test, chi-squared test, p-value, etc) because the authors worked hard to combat common misconceptions about these commonly used statistical tests. Here is a rather oversimplified rule-of-thumb for these different tests:</p>

<ol>
<li>t-test: Used when you are looking at the <em>means</em> of different populations. For example, you might want to determine whether the difference in the mean gene expression level between treated and untreated cells is different, or if the gene expression level of cells in a certain environment differs from what you would expect in a null hypothesis. <strong>Assumptions:</strong> You are assuming that the populations you are looking at are normally distributed. The variance of the populations is not known (that would be a Z-test), but it is assumed that the variance of each population is the same. Finally, for the t-test to work, the samples of the data from the two populations are assumed to be independent.</li>
<li>$\chi^2$ test: Several possibilities for this. The most common in biology is the Pearson $\chi^2$ test, which is used when you are looking at <em>categorical data</em>, like the number of pea plants with white or purple flowers and round or wrinkled seeds, and trying to see whether the number of individuals in each category is consistent with some null hypothesis (such as the number in each category you'd expect if the genes for flower color and seed shape are not linked). <strong>Assumptions:</strong> The data points were randomly and independently gathered from the population, and you have a reasonably large number of samples.</li>

"What is the armpit hair for?","74570","","<p>Modern human beings, especially women, cut their armpit hair. It seems to me the armpit hair is trivial/useless. Shortly speaking, what is the armpit hair for?</p>
","<p>I have been trying to read up a bit on this. I started out looking on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underarm_hair"">wikipedia</a> and it seems there are three hypotheses which are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>1.Aid the wicking of sweat away from the skin  </p>

<p>2.Reduce friction between the thorax and upper arm  </p>

<p>3.Facilitate the release of sex pheromones</p>

<p>The first would seem possible because it would help to prevent <a href=""http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877%2806%2900208-8/abstract"">over-heating of the lymph node</a>s under the armpits and that also fits with the fact there are a lot of sweat glands there.</p>

<p>The second, I can't find any citations which support this but I understand that people who shave their armpits tend to suffer from dry underarms. This could be a result of increased friction.</p>

<p>The third is apparently controversial although it seems perfectly reasonable and highly likely to me. There is <a href=""http://www.drjoebio.com/uploads/1/8/1/3/1813500/mhc_mate_preference_smell_t_shirts.pdf"">a famous experiment</a> by Claus Wedekind who got men to wear a t-shirt for a few days. He then got women to choose a most preferred male purely by the scent of the t-shirt and found interesting results relating to the MHC profiles. The armpit hair could help to trap the odour produced by the sweat and help with mate attraction, like some kind of scent sponge. I don't understand why this is so controversial, loads of animals influence mate choice with scent - perhaps people don't like to think we are genetically attracted to each other by sweat because it seems animalistic and less romantic.</p>

<p>In summary, there is no sure answer and it could well be all of the above, or something entirely different.</p>

"Death because of distilled water consumption","74083","","<p>One of my friends said that I would die if I drank distilled water (we were using it in a chemistry experiment) I gave it a go and surprisingly did not die.</p>

<p>It said that drinking only this kind of water could definitely cause death, as distilled water was highly hypotonic and it would make the blood cells expand and finally explode and ultimately cause death.</p>

<p>I wanted to know exactly how much of this water on an average was needed to be consumed to cause death. </p>
","<p>Drinking a <em><strong>little bit</strong></em> of distilled water is not fatal. Drinking <em><strong>only</strong></em> this kind of water and ingesting nothing else will eventually be fatal because it is highly hypotonic as you've found out.</p>

<p>Salt balance in the body is largely maintained by passive diffusion. Salts diffuse from areas of relatively high concentration (eg, stomach) down to areas of low concentration. For example, if you have just eaten a meal, the stomach contents are relatively higher in salt concentration compared to the surrounding tissue and the blood. Salt diffuses out of the stomach and into the stomach lining, intestines and blood. Tissues have to make sure they don't get too much salt or they will take in too much water and burst, so they have active transport mechanisms to remove excess salts and they go into the blood as well. Now that the excess salts are carried in the blood, they ultimately get filtered at the kidneys and excreted in urine. The kidneys are able to filter the salt by taking advantage of this gradient moving salt once again from high to low concentrations. The exact details are not important for this discussion, other than to know the kidneys need a highly concentrated store of salt to function.</p>

<p>Distilled water on the other hand, has no salt. It is pure water. Distilled water will pull salt out of the tissues because now it is the absolute lowest concentration of salt. Tissues will also take in a lot of this water because it too passively diffuses and it is hypotonic. When this happens in the blood, red blood cells tend to burst because they can't tolerate a terribly large change in tonicity, and so some red blood cells die. The other problem is also that the salt control mechanisms in the kidneys malfunction because too much salt gets leeched out of them and passed in your urine.</p>

<p>After drinking too much distilled water, electrolytes and important minerals get leeched out of your body and this creates electrical abnormalities in your body leading to irregular and weak heart beats (from hyponatremia and hypokalemia), poor muscle strength, high blood pressure and fatigue. Distilled water as mentioned, is fairly acidity (can be as low as pH 3 when freshly distilled) and leads to acidification of the blood (acidosis).</p>

<p>There is no exact amount of water that one needs to drink to die. This mode of death is related to hyperhydration/water intoxication. This can happen from over-hydrating with regular tap water, but will take longer than distilled water because of the salt content in tap water.</p>

"What is the function of the RNA primer in DNA replication?","71859","","<p>During DNA replication, RNA primase puts an RNA primer in the lagging strand. What is the function of this RNA primer? Why can't the enzymes put DNA fragments directly?</p>
","<p>DNA polymerases need a primer oligonucleotide (RNA or DNA) - their substrates are an existing 3'-OH group and a dNTP. The primase however is a typical RNA polymerase, capable of initiating polynucleotide synthesis <em>de novo</em> by positioning a complementary ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate opposite its complementary DNA base. The primase makes an RNA primer that the DNA polymerase can then use for chain extension. The RNA primer is ultimately degraded and replaced by a DNA polymerase.</p>

<p>The rationale for this difference is that DNA polymerases have an active site that is geared towards proofreading and that primerless initiation would be an error-prone process. By having the primers 'tagged' by virtue of them being RNA, it is possible for the replication machinery to use them but then replace them with a high fidelity DNA copy of the template strand.</p>

<p><strong>Edit in response to OP comment:</strong>
Synthesis of the leading strand consists of extending an existing DNA. However the leading strand is also originally initiated, at the ori element, with an RNA primer. Once that first initiation event has taken place the synthesis of the leading strand is simply a process of extending that original primer.</p>

<p>Some viruses employ ingenious variations on this theme such as using tRNA primers , or proteins - see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

"Do animal cells have vacuoles?","61427","","<p>I overheard a rather heated argument about whether or not animal cells have vacuoles.</p>

<p>The other person said they don't. While there is <em>something</em> there that acts similar to a vacuole, it's slightly different. The person also noted that the only websites that say that <em>something</em> as a vacuole aren't credible sites (ie. not University sites, etc...)</p>

<p>I'm really curious as to which it is: Do animal cells have vacuoles or not?</p>
","<p>They are both right.</p>

<p>Animal cells do have vacuoles, but they are smaller, larger in number (plant cells usually have just one or a few large vacuoles) AND serve a somewhat different purpose than those of plants.</p>

<p>A vacuole is basically a membrane-covered compartment (vesicle) filled with molecules, that shouldn't, right now, be in the cytoplasm. For plants, this means long-term storage of water and waste products, which cannot be removed from the cell due to the cell wall. For animals it means mostly taking part in exocytosis and endocytosis - they are much more dynamic structures.</p>

"how to close a severed artery/vein?","56282","","<p>This is a medicine-related question that I've been wondering about. I've been watching medical lectures on YouTube regarding the human body and was wondering about how surgeons treat a severed artery or vein (think Juggular or Carotid)? Specifically I was curious about what kind of tools they use and what the technique is for performing this operation.</p>

<p>And before anyone asks, no, I don't need to treat someone with this kind of injury :).</p>

<p>Thanks,
mj</p>
","<p>I'm going to take a shot at putting a whole lot of information into a small answer, so let me know what parts need more explanation.  To any others experienced with closure, I am certainly skipping plenty of steps and ideas in attempt to convey the general.</p>

<p>******A general warning that graphic surgical images are used below.******</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Setup:</h2>

<p>You asked about ""severed"" jugular and carotid injuries, so we will focus on neck injuries, with a focus on insults to the R/L <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"" rel=""noreferrer"">common carotid arteries (CCA)</a> and the R/L <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_jugular_vein"" rel=""noreferrer"">internal jugular vein (IJV)</a>.  To get everyone on the same page visually, we are talking about the large blood vessels in this image:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/B5Tzn.png"" alt=""dissection of human neck""></p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, we will deal with injuries that are focused directly on these vessels.  In reality, there are so many different and important tissues tightly packed in the neck that there are often many complications and multiple vessels that need to be dealt with near simultaneously.  Further, we will suppose that our patient (pt) is unlucky to have a ""severed"" vessel in his neck, but lucky enough to have immediate access to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Trauma_Life_Support"" rel=""noreferrer"">ATLS</a>.</p>

<p>Just like you should have learned in your basic neighborhood CPR/aid class, you address the ABC's (MD's add DE): <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_%28medicine%29"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>A</strong> irway, <strong>B</strong> reathing, <strong>C</strong> irculation</a> (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S28478"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>D</strong> isability, <strong>E</strong> xposure</a>).  In reality when presented with a pt bleeding from the neck, you will almost always begin by applying pressure at the wound site, while you address the airway.  When I say ""applying pressure"" I literally mean a nurse or medic putting their fingers up against where it is bleeding and trying to stop it like a hose.</p>

<p>We will assume that a clear airway is established, the pt is breathing normally enough, and under <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"" rel=""noreferrer"">general anaesthesia</a>.  We will also give us the advantage of having the head, and to a little lesser extent body, packed down with ice.  This will give us precious time, and help <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2013.03.03"" rel=""noreferrer"">prevent brain damage</a>.  All else is presumed to be well with the pt, and all we need to do is fix the bleed in his neck.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Identifying the problem:</h2>

<p>Now that we have our idealized pt ready to fix, the first thing you have to do is to identify where the bleed is.  Assuming you have serious bleeding, like one would come from a ""severed"" CCA or IJV that normally means cutting open the wound quickly and in a controlled manner.  Again, the neck is full of tissue you don't want to damage, so a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location#Anterior_and_posterior"" rel=""noreferrer"">anterior</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternocleidomastoid_muscle"" rel=""noreferrer"">sternocleidomastoid</a> incision is <a href=""http://www.acssurgery.com/acssurgery/institutional/getChapterByIDHTML.action?chapId=part07_ch04&amp;type=tab"" rel=""noreferrer"">normally called for</a> when you are looking for where the CCA or IJV is damaged.  As opposed to coming from the top the way we would dissect a cadaver (as in the drawing above), the sternocleidomastoid incision will give us a side view into the neck like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sY24T.jpg"" alt=""anterior sternocleidomastoid incision""></p>

<p>The point at this stage is to <a href=""http://www.trauma.org/archive/vascular/PVTmanage.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">gain control of the bleed</a>.  You don't want to just go digging in where the vessel is bleeding, because you are likely to cause more damage than help (and in this case, loose the pt).  Instead you are going to clamp above and below where the vessel is bleeding.  This will let you suck out the blood and see what's going on.  If you happen to have a large wound in a large vein, there's a chance that a clamp won't give you sufficient control of the bleeding.  In that case you have to also use a catheter to stop the bleeding (<a href=""http://www.acssurgery.com/acssurgery/institutional/getChapterByIDHTML.action?chapId=part07_ch04&amp;type=tab"" rel=""noreferrer"">in obtaining distil control to be specific</a>).</p>

<p>In our case, this means dissecting the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_sheath"" rel=""noreferrer"">carotid sheath</a>.  This needs to be done very carefully so that you don't damage the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve"" rel=""noreferrer"">vagus nerve</a>.</p>

<p>You may have noticed I kept putting ""severed"" in quotes.  That's because it matters how the vessels are damaged.  Were they crushed or ground apart? Cut jagged or cleanly? Transverse or longitudinal?  All of these change the exact procedures into how you go forward.  Clearly a vessel that has a small tear is easier to repair than one that has been totally separated with jagged shredding from a crush injury.  Veins and arteries won't retract from the insult in the same way either, so how you find them can be a bit different.  Here is a flow chart that shows the basic decisions:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lIOuJ.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<h2>Put it back together Doc: [warning of graphic images]</h2>

<p>You may notice that there are basically two end points for either veins or arteries: repair it or ligate it.  There are many different technical/specific ways either can be done, but those are beyond the scope of this answer.  If the sight of open wounds bothers you, note I am going to start using actual surgical photos below.</p>

<p>When it's possible it's better to repair the vessel.  That means that you can close the artery where it is.  If there is just a small hole, you can suture the hole closed.  With the CCA or IJV it's more likely that you are going to need a patch.  This means that you take another piece of vein or a synthetic replacement, and suture it into the hole.  I always like to tell people surgery is a lot more tailoring than most people realize (not that this is as easy as sewing fabric).  Below is an example of where a patch would be used in the CCA:</p>

<p>First the tear in the artery:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/P5h0r.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And after the patch has been added:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tLzE2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Suturing and patching can only be used to close the vessels when tension isn't needed to repair the wound.  If the laceration or severing of the vessels are such that it has come mostly (not completely) apart, but you can still get the ends together with NO tension,  end-to-end anastomosis repair can be utilized.  This means that you take the two ends, with branches if there are any at the wound, and suture them back together.</p>

<p>Again here is an example of the opening in the artery (popliteal):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1wWGA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And here it is again after end-to-end anastomosis repair:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4fqsY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now let's say that you really did get the vessel cut in half.  That's a bit of bad news for you, you're going to have to ligate the vessel.  That means sewing up the end of it to close it down.  You start above the injury in arteries and below in veins, and then you tie at least three loops--many prefer five loops--down on the vein, and make a clean cut leaving at least two loops on the part staying in the body.  Then you do the same thing on the other side of the injury.  I think this is best displayed by a video, unfortunately most of the good ones I know of are not available to the public.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cEnVlwKkZY"" rel=""noreferrer"">This video</a> certainly not the best technique I've ever seen but it get's the idea across.  I will search for a better video as I have time.</p>

<p>Now if it is possible, a surgeon will try to make a graft deal with the ligation.  The first choice is a <a href=""http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/338141.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">interposition graft</a>.  This means taking a larger vein graft and connecting the two ends of the severed vessel.  You do this after making clean ends with the ligations from above.</p>

<p>Here we have the femoral artery prepped for an interposition graft:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQbSJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And here is interposition graft in place:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dOM3n.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In certain cases, this is not possible.  As strange as it sounds, the ligation may just be left in place, depending on where it is.  </p>

<hr>

<h2>Is that all?</h2>

<p>No, not by a long shot, but that is the basics.  There are many different techniques that can be used, with new and better ones being invented often.  For example instead of suturing, chemical cauterizing of the ligation can be used and is quicker.  That also allows the surgery to be done through a scope.  But the basics remain the same:</p>

<p><strong>Stop the bleeding, gain basic access, get full control of the bleeding, obtain full exposure/access, sew up the problem,</strong> put everything back, close up, give fluids, and send them to ICU.  Even after getting everything right in surgery, the recovery can be quite difficult.</p>

Or do some insects have red ""juice"" themselves, so the color is red on its own and not caused by sucking higher animal's blood?</p>

<p>I squashed a small fly-like insect recently, it produced a red stain, so I am wondering if the stain come from the insect itself or if it has to be some other animal's blood.</p>
","<p>No - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood#Invertebrates"">invertebrates don't have ""blood"" though they do have hemolymph</a>. Hemolymph flows around the body cavity, rather than through vessels such as veins and capillaries, and comes in to direct contact with tissues and <em>generally</em> it is not red.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hemolymph fills all of the interior (the hemocoel) of the animal's
  body and surrounds all cells. It contains hemocyanin, a copper-based
  protein that turns blue in color when oxygenated, instead of the
  iron-based hemoglobin in red blood cells found in vertebrates, thus
  giving hemolymph a blue-green color rather than the red color of
  vertebrate blood. When not oxygenated, hemolymph quickly loses its
  color and appears grey. The hemolymph of lower arthropods, including
  most insects, is not used for oxygen transport because these animals
  respirate directly from their body surfaces (internal and external) to
  air, but it does contain nutrients such as proteins and sugars.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The red you see from squashing, depending on the insect, could come from blood of other animals or (eye) pigments produced by the insect. For example, in my lab we have some <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> with red eyes and some with white eyes (they carry a genetic mutation which represses the production of pigments in the eye) - if I squash the red eyed fly red ""juice"" is left on the desk, this doesn't happen with the white eyed flies.</p>

"How does laughing gas (N₂O) work?","53886","","<p>Laughing gas (N<sub>2</sub>O), well, makes people laugh.</p>

<p>How does just a gas make us do that, there has to be some hormones at work...</p>

<p>So, I wanted to know how this works?  What is the mechanism?</p>
","<p>This information is all strictly for Entonox - a brand of analgesic gas comprising 50% Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and 50% Nitrous Oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), Laughing Gas.  This mixture is known as 'Gas and Air' and is in very common use.  </p>

<p>The active ingredient in Entonox is of course the nitrous oxide, so the discussion of the mechanism below refers solely to the N<sub>2</sub>O as you asked for.</p>

<p>Nitrous oxide enters the blood by diffusion from the alveoli whilst it is being inhaled, but does not bind with haemoglobin.  It is fat soluble so quickly moves into cells, including synapse ends in the brain.  Because of the stability of the compound, N<sub>2</sub>O is not metabolised by the body so has its effect as that molecule, then is eliminated by diffusion out of the lungs once inhalation has ceased (taking roughly 2 minutes for on and offset).  </p>

<p>According to the material that BOC pharmaceuticals provide, the exact mechanism of the analgesia is not <em>fully</em> understood.  It <em>is</em> known, however, to induce ""inconsistent changes in the basal levels of thalamic nuclei"".  </p>

<p>N<sub>2</sub>O inhibits NMDA receptors in the brain whilst simultaneously encouraging the stimulation of the parasympathetic GABA receptors.  This eventually produces an anaesthetic effect.  It is also understood that N<sub>2</sub>O promotes the release of endogenous opioid neurotransmitters ('natural painkillers' e.g. endorphins) that specifically activate <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12034378"">descending pain pathways</a>.  This inhibits the transmission of pain.  In this way the analgesia provided by nitrous oxide is antinociceptive (literally pain reducing) rather than a generalised limbic depressor.  </p>

<p>However, nitrous oxide also positively effects potassium ion channels too <sup>[<a href=""http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/65/2/443.short"">ref</a>]</sup> - reducing the chance of an action potential being generated in affected neurons.  Research into this area of the effects of N<sub>2</sub>O is ongoing.  </p>

<p>Euphoria is a common side effect of N<sub>2</sub>O usage, hence the name laughing gas.  This is as part of wider emotional changes that can occur when nitrous oxide is being administered.  For example, some people instead of laughing become scared or in other cases extremely aggressive towards those nearby. The emotional excitement may result in depressive or manic behaviour even to the point of psychosis and hallucinations especially in those who have a preexisting vulnerability to mental illness. The precise mechanism for these disinhibiting is again not fully understood. </p>

<p>Whilst it seems a lot of the answers are missing, the course I'm taking this information from is available online at <a href=""http://discover.entonox.co.uk/"">Discover Entonox</a> - modules 8-10 have relevance to this question.

<p>""Long"" bones - like the tibia, fibula, femur, humerus, etc. grow at the ends during childhood via a special formation called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyseal_plate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Epiphyseal plate</a> (also known as ""growth plates""). The plates are composed of a special cartilage that grows, and slowly calcifies as a person reaches adulthood. </p>

<p>When the growth plates completely stop expanding <a href=""http://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/health_articles/your-growing-bones-all-about-growth-plates"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is left to genetics, but generally happens 2 years after puberty finishes - about 16 for women and 18 for men</a>. So after those ages there's little, if any, significant growth - though it can happen in very rare cases.</p>

<p>To date there aren't any exercises you can perform that will elongate bones. It doesn't make physiological sense; stretching puts stress on muscles and tendons - not bones. Weight lifting will compress bones, making them more dense and will make you shorter in the long run.</p>

<p>While there's been some success in getting chondrocytes to grow cartilage <em>in vitro</em>, there has yet to be significant gains <em>in vivo</em>, thus there aren't any medications available that would cause growth.</p>

<p>The only widely practiced way of gaining height after adulthood is with very painful surgery that involves a lot of braces. The bones are systematically broken, held in place, and allowed to heal. The setup looks like this:</p>

Does it depend on either its size (i.e., does a big octopus from deep sea survive longer than a tiny octopus) or the species?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Under ideal conditions, an octopus may survive several minutes on land.  </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Octopuses have <strong>gills</strong> and hence are <strong>dependent on water</strong> for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Gills collapse on land because of the lack of buoyancy (source: <a href=""http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=4461"" rel=""noreferrer"">UC Santa Barbara</a>). Octopuses have three hearts. Two of these are dedicated to move blood to the animal’s gills, emphasizing the animal's dependence on its gills for oxygen supply. The third heart keeps circulation flowing to the organs. This organ heart actually stops beating when the octopus swims, explaining the species’ tendency to crawl rather than swim (source: <a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-curious-facts-about-octopuses-7625828/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Smithsonian</a>).</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/land-walking-octopus-explained-video/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Scientific American</a>, crawling out of the water is not uncommon for species of octopus that live in intertidal waters or near the shore (Fig. 1). Because most species of octopus are nocturnal, we humans just don't see it often. Their boneless bodies are seemingly unfit for moving out of water, but it is thought to be food-motivated, e.g. shellfish and snails that can be found in tidal pools. </p>

<p>Octopuses depend on water to breathe, so in addition to being a cumbersome mode of transportation, the land crawl is also a gamble. When their <strong>skin stays moist</strong>, a limited amount of gas exchange can occur through <strong>passive diffusion</strong>. This allows the octopus to survive on land for short periods of time, because oxygen is absorbed through the skin, instead of the gills. In moist, coastal areas it is believed they can crawl on land for <strong>at least several minutes</strong>. Mostly they go from pool to pool, never staying out of the water for extended periods. If faced with a dry surface in the sun, they will not survive for long (source: <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/land-walking-octopus-explained-video/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Scientific American</a>). </p>

<p>Your sub questions; I <em>think</em> small octopuses may survive longer, since passive gas exchange is the mode of survival on land. In general, an increase in diameter causes the volume to increase with a third power, while surface increases with a power of two. Therefore, an <strong>increase in body size reduces the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-area-to-volume_ratio"" rel=""noreferrer"">surface-to-volume ratio</a></strong> and leads to <strong>reduced gas exchange</strong>. Because passive gas exchange needs large surface-to-volume ratios, I am inclined to believe small octopuses may cope better with terrestrial environments. However, in hot, arid conditions it is likely a bigger one will have an advantage, because it can store more oxygen in its blood. </p>

<p>In terms of species, I have to say I couldn't find any sources going in so much detail on this. Likely, as said, smaller species may do better in cool, moist conditions, while larger specimens may be better off in dry environments.    </p>

"Fish ""coming back to life"" after being frozen","51201","","<p>I've encountered a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwolYFGM9pU&amp;feature=fvwrel"">clip on Youtube</a> showing a goldfish thrown in liquid nitrogen and immediately after to normal water and swimming normally. In the explanation to the clip it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For everyone that is worried about the goldfish, it survived and was perfectly fine until we fed him and a few of his friends to our turtles. (Which is what they were bought for in the first place!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am wondering now as to several issues.</p>

<p>If the goldfish wasn't fed to the turtles and was allowed to live out its life, would it suffer any long term damages from the act?</p>

<p>Is time an issue here, if the fish was kept frozen for a longer time, would it suffer more damage and would it be able to be revived?</p>

<p>Is the size and nature of the fish's body a factor? Would a larger animal or an animal with better resistance to frost that would take more time to completely freeze have damage due to gradual freezing of body and systems?</p>

<p>Does the fact that fish have cold blood affect the result of the experiment?</p>
","<p>I have no idea what's the real reason for the survival of the poor fish, but I would guess this is all in the timing. I know for certain ;-) that one can submerge a hand in liquid nitrogen for a short time or in general one can pour liquid nitrogen on the skin with no harm done whatsoever.</p>

<p>The reason is that the difference in temperature that interface (-180 deg C or so for liquid nitrogen and 20-30 for the skin surface) is so large that nitrogen vaporizes instantly and does not penetrate/affect the tissue. The demonstrator could have pulled the fish with bare hands.</p>

<p>I think that for the goldfish the time was too short and while it was cooled/shocked a bit, it might have been too short to do any serious damage. But -</p>

<p>As a scientist, I can't help but notice that we don't really know the condition of the fish before or after the liquid nitrogen 'treatment'. We only see it flapping for a few seconds when back in water. I wonder what happened to the eyes and the mouth, both quite sensitive tissues for such a shock. Also, the water the fish was in was a factor probably, providing additional buffer between the fish and the liquid nitrogen.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the ethical committee quite certainly did not approve that demonstration.</p>

"Why Does Salt Water Help Sore Throats?","50367","","<p>I am having some trouble understanding how salt water, a simple solution, could so effectively remove the pains of a sore throat. </p>

<p>I do believe that the answer is closely related to hypo/hyper-tonic solutions, but why is this so, and how does this work?</p>
","<p>Salt water may have <strong>anti-septic</strong> properties due to the effect it has on water potential.  Pure water has a water potential (Ψ) of zero.  A concentrated salt solution has a lower (more-negative) water potential.  The water potential of the salt solution is likely to be more negative than that of the pathogen's cytoplasm; the salt solution is therefore referred to as hypertonic.  Therefore water osmoses out of the cell (osmosis being the net movement of water from a higher water potential to a lower water potential across a semi-permeable membrane).  The loss of water from the pathogenic cells causes osmotic crenation - the cell becomes shrivelled and dies.  </p>

<p>A hypotonic solution (for example cells placed into pure water) would cause the opposite effect - osmotic lysis.  This is the bursting of the cell due to the movement of water into the cell.  The bacterial cell wall would first have to be damaged (e.g. by penicillin).  This would <em>not</em> be the process by which a salt solution has effect, however.</p>

<p>The fact that the salt water is warm in order to improve solubility may also have the side-effect of causing vasodilation around the infection, increasing the rate at which white blood cells can arrive at the infection site.</p>

<p>It has been more difficult to find a theory as to why a salt solution would have analgesic properties, see the comments below &amp; previous versions of this answer.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I'd say it's <strong>plausible</strong>, depending on your definition of ""Green."" While your eyes do, indeed, have RGB receptors (cones) and Rods for grayscale - they don't perceive the Visible Spectrum equally. Here are a few graphs I found from Photo.net regarding the human eye and the sensitivity of the Cones (first and second) and Rods (third):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hnGdt.jpg"" alt=""RGB cell detections""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rRu4N.jpg"" alt=""Visible Wavelength sensitivity of the human eye""></p>

<p>What you should be noticing above is not necessarily the Y axis, but the X axis - which represents the Wavelength, and amount of Wavelength our eyes are sensitive to each color. While our eyes perceives the most <em>Red</em> wavelengths and the least <em>Blue</em> wavelengths, <em>Green</em> comes in just under Red's range for Wavelength coverage. However... </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kmtb2.jpg"" alt=""Cone response of the human eye""></p>

<p>When combined with our Rod sensitivity, though, <em>Green</em> wavelengths produce nearly double the sensitivity the <em>Red</em> Wavelengths - and nearly quadruple the <em>Blue</em> wavelengths. What that means is that in low-light situations when the Cones are unable to produce a precise color image, your Rods will be able to pick out <em>Green</em> things (with a slightly loose definition of 'Green') more than other colors - which is perhaps the reason why night-vision goggles often use Green since they increase the <strong>Intensity</strong> of the light, which presumably stimulates the Rods more (although not knowing precisely how the image is produced - if the green coloring is enhancing that particular bit of the spectrum of falsely colored - take this with a grain of salt).</p>

<p>Does that explicitly prove you can see more <em>Green</em> shades than others? <strong>No.</strong> Your brain does <em>a lot</em> of processing - the entire color Yellow is a construction of your brain, and Tetrachromats (people with 4 types of Cones) are real. </p>

<p>However, like I said above, I'd say it's plausible. </p>

"Why draw blood from veins rather than arteries?","49940","","<p>Why draw blood from veins rather than arteries? Is it more convenient or safer?</p>
","<p>Veins have several advantages over arteries. From a purely practical standpoint, veins are easier to access due to their superficial location compared to the arteries which are located deeper under the skin. They have thinner walls (much less smooth muscle surrounding them) than arteries, and have less innervation, so piercing them with a needle requires less force and doesn't hurt as much. Venous pressure is also lower than arterial pressure, so there is less of a chance of blood seeping back out through the puncture point before it heals. Because of their thinner walls, veins tend to be larger than the corresponding artery in the area, so they hold more blood, making collection easier and faster. </p>

<p>Finally, it is somewhat safer if a small embolism (bubble in the blood) is introduced into a vein rather than an artery. Blood flow in veins always goes to larger and larger vessels, so there is very little chance of a vessel being blocked by the embolism before the bubble reaches the heart/lungs and is hopefully destroyed. Blood flow in an artery, on the other hand, always moves into smaller and smaller vessels, eventually ending in capilllaries, and there is a chance that a bubble introduced by a blood draw (generally rare) or more commonly an intravenous line (IV) could block a small blood vessel, potentially leading to hypoxia in the affected tissues.</p>

"Absorption ratios 260/280 and 260/230 for RNA","49317","","<p>I extracted RNA from different cell lines, an I want to perform reverse transcription and then PCR.

<p>I got values for the 260/280 ratio from 2.1 to 2.13 and values for the 260/230 ratio from 0.98 to 2.01. Are these values acceptable, and what information can I gain from them?</p>
","<p>DNA and RNA absorb at 260nm. Proteins absorb at 280nm. The 260/280 ratio is a good estimate of how pure your sample is. For RNA, the 260/280 should be around 2. If it is lower, this might be an indication from contamination or proteins, phenol, or other contaminants in your sample. The 260/230 ratio is a second measure for purity of the sample, as the contaminants absorb at 230nm (like EDTA). The 260/230 ratio should be higher than the 260/280 ratio, as it is usually between 2 and 2.2. Lower ratio might be an indication of contamination.</p>

<p>In your case, I would be worried about the purity of the sample which gave you 260/230 ratio of 0.98. If you are using nanodrop, looking at the plot can also be a good indication of the quality of your sample. For a pure sample, a well defined peak (no shoulders or wiggles) at 260nm is expected. </p>

"What is the effect of extra-cellular potassium concentration on heart rate and conduction velocity?","46405","","<p>If the extracellular potassium concentration surrounding a myocyte increases, then the potassium gradient accross the cell membrane decreases, and therefore the resting membrane potential will become more positive.  Similarly, if extracellular potassium decreases, the resting membrane potential will be more negative.</p>

<p>With this in mind, how does the heart rate change when extracellular potassium concentration increases/decreases?</p>
","<p>Pathological potassium concentration promotes arrhythmia.</p>

<p><strong>Increased extracellular potassium</strong> inactivates $Na^+$ channels and opens $K^+$ channels, causing the cells to become refractory [1]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Increased extracellular potassium levels result in depolarization of the membrane potentials of cells due to the increase in the equilibrium potential of potassium. This depolarization opens some voltage-gated sodium channels, but also increases the inactivation at the same time. Since depolarization due to concentration change is slow, it never generates an action potential by itself instead, it results in accommodation. Above a certain level of potassium the depolarization inactivates sodium channels, opens potassium channels, thus the cells become refractory. This leads to the impairment of neuromuscular, cardiac, and gastrointestinal organ systems. Of most concern is the impairment of cardiac conduction which can result in ventricular fibrillation or asystole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Decreased extracellular potassium</strong> leads to hyperpolarization [2]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lower potassium levels in the extracellular space will cause hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. As a result, a greater than normal stimulus is required for depolarization of the membrane in order to initiate an action potential.</p>
  
  <p>In the heart, hypokalemia causes hyperpolarization in the myocytes' resting membrane potential. The more negative membrane potentials in the atrium may cause arrhythmias because of more complete recovery from sodium-channel inactivation, making the triggering of an action potential less likely. In addition, the reduced extracellular potassium (paradoxically) inhibits the activity of the $I_{Kr}$ potassium current and delays ventricular repolarization. This delayed repolarization may promote reentrant arrhythmias.</p>

","<p>When females are in their mother's womb all their Oogonium (plural Oogonia) are being made, they they undergo mitotic divisions to become a primary oocyte. Then, the primary oocytes start to undergo meiosis I -  but meiosis I is arrested. This is the first meiotic arrest. Meiosis I continues when a female hits puberty, every month one or more primary oocytes undergo meiosis I and create secondary oocytes. These secondary oocytes will then  start the second meiotic division, but this second meiotic division is arrested as well. It is arrested for about 24 hours, waiting for a sperm to fertilise it in the Fallopian tubes. The only time an egg (or in medical terms - secondary oocyte) will complete meiosis II is if a sperm penetrates the egg, and then it is called an ovum, which develops into a zygote and a then foetus.</p>

<p>Therefore, the answer to your question will be - the first meiotic arrest in oogenesis will occur from the time the primary oocytes are created in the womb, until a female reaches  puberty. starting puberty until menopause every month one or more primary oocytes will mature and complete the first meiotic division.</p>

","<p>Primary oocytes are formed prenatally and reain suspended in prophase of meiosis I for years until the onset of puberty. An oocyte completes meiosis I as its follicle matures (during ovulation) resulting in a secondary oocyte and the FIRST polar body. After ovulation, each oocyte continues to metaphase of meiosis II.

<p>Genetics and environment play a role in determining height. First of all, a more nutritious environment during development can lead to increased height, <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-we-getting-taller/"">this is one reason why more recent generations appear to be taller.</a></p>

<p>Height is also an example of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_genetics"">quantitative trait</a> - this means many genes (or loci [singular is locus], locations in the DNA) affect the phenotype (the physical measurable result i.e. a persons height). It is infact how the vast majority of traits are determined. At each locus that affects height there may be polymorphism (when more than one allele, or variant of that gene, exists).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Suppose height entirely is determined by 2 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_genetic_effects"">additive</a> loci, $A$ and $B$, and no environmental effect occurs, and there is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy"">diploidy</a> (two of each locus, one from each parent, determines height in a person). </p>

<p>Each locus has two alleles denoted by $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1 $ and $B_2$. Each copy of alleles $A_1$ and $B_1$ add 40 cm to a persons height, $A_2$ and $B_2$ add 50 cm to a persons height. </p>

<p>Now a man who is $A_1 A_1, B_1 B_2$ (remember, humans are diploid) and a woman who is $A_2 A_1, B_1 B_1$ have children. Both parents are 170 cm tall. The theoretical limits for the population would be 160 cm and 200 cm. The children will inherit one copy of $A_1$ from the father and $B_1$ from the mother, but they could inherit either $B_1$ or $B_2$ from the father and either $A_1$ or $A_2$ from the mother. If a child inherited both of the taller alleles then they would be taller than the parents ($A_1 A_2, B_1 B_2$ = 180 cm). Likewise some offspring could be shorter.</p>

<p>Of course the reality is much more complex; height is determined by many more than 2 loci, by the environment, and gene * environment interactions.

"How long can human tissue last without blood?","41632","","<p>I've heard it said various times that the body's tissues will begin to necrotize after being cut off from the blood supply for only a few minutes, but that can't be true.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I woke up one morning and apparently I'd been sleeping <em>just right</em> so that the main artery to my left arm was totally pinched closed, because it was completely numb.  Not just ""arm's fallen asleep"", either; I had no mental control over the entire arm and no feeling in it.  I could lift it up with my right hand, and it would fall back down immediately when I let go of it, and I didn't feel anything when it landed on the mattress.  It kind of freaked me out at first, but in just a few minutes I felt the ""pins and needles"" feeling of circulation returning, and it was 100% back to normal within less than an hour.</p>

<p>Given that I had presumably been sleeping on it like that for several hours, and yet I somehow didn't end up with a dead, useless arm that needed to be amputated, I know from personal experience that tissue doesn't die within a few minutes.  So how long does it really take?</p>
","<p>As EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) instructors will tell you now, when wearing a tourniquet, you have about four hours to get the injury to a vascular surgeon and get it cared for appropriately. The rule therefore is four hours. However, the common thread I see in most sources is that about an hour and a half is the longest you want to go without blood flow to a limb.</p>

<p>As far as what happened to you, it sounds more like the limb simply fell asleep. When a limb falls asleep, it is getting the nerve pinched off for a time as well as loosing some blood flow. However, this is not a complete loss and so your arm is able to survive because it is still receiving enough oxygen and other nutrients to sustain its existence (as well as having toxins and CO2 pumped away from it).  </p>

<p>I had a very difficult time finding any concrete, scientific information on this subject overall.</p>

<p>So, if you would like more information about this, please visit the following links. The first is a WikiPedia link on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_infarction/%22Limb%20Infarctions%22"">Limb Infarctions (or an embloism in a limb)</a>. The second is from Mental Floss on <a href=""http://mentalfloss.com/article/21035/why-do-limbs-fall-asleep"">Why Limbs Fall Asleep</a>. The third is a somewhat random article on someone's personal experience on <a href=""http://www.science20.com/geeks039_guide_world_domination/how_long_you_can_sleep_your_arm_without_losing_it"">Sleeping on their arm</a>.</p>

<p>So, in summary: although I could find no solid evidence on how long a limb can live without its blood supply, it appears to be about 2-4 hours (some sources say 5-8); however, I would like to add that your case appears to be a severe case of an asleep limb, you were/are likely in no danger. Also, if your arm indeed <em>did</em> have circulation completely cut off, it would have turned pale, then blue and later a livid red and purple as the blood began to pool; you then would begin to experience the effects of the limb dying i.e. necrosis, gangrene.  </p>

"Why is SOC medium recommended for transformations?","41443","","<p>In pretty much every transformation protocol I've seen SOC medium is used to grow the bacteria for a short while after the tranformation and before plating. </p>

<p>I've usually substituted LB medium for this step for easy retransformations, but I gather that the SOC medium is supposed to make some difference in efficiency, or else the simpler LB medium would be recommended in the protocols.</p>

<p>Why is SOC medium used for transformations? What difference does substituting with LB medium cause for the transformation efficiency? </p>
","<p>To summarize from <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6345791"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hanahan's paper</a> (see below for reference), he carried out a systematic review of conditions necessary to improve transfection efficiency. Among the conditions tested were the presence of various cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>), DMSO, and growth temperatures (and a few other conditions not so commonly used these days). He worked with a strain that he subsequently isolated a derivative of, called DH1, which is now available commercially as DH1-alpha and other strain derivatives.</p>

<p>He defined transformation efficiency to be the number of transformed colonies on a plate, a measurement still used today. He found when the transforming media contained: certain cations, specifcally Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>; as well as DTT, hexamine cobalt (III) and DMSO; greatly improved the transfection efficiency compared to the standard Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment. He also found that sucrose and K<sup>+</sup> were useful, though not strictly necessary for his experimental strain. It was stated in this paper, though not explained, that sucrose acted as a stabilizer, possibly to guard against his initial use of 0°C incubation and/or freeze/thaw cycling. For the rest of his work, he did not use sucrose.</p>

<p>Among his conclusions, he states that DTT is necessary, as well as di-valent and mono-valent cations, but that they seem to be nonspecific. In other words, there is no strict requirement for having Ca<sup>2+</sup>, since Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> perform equally well, nor is there a requirement for K<sup>+</sup>, though it's admittedly easier to use than Rb+.</p>

<p>There are today a number of ""rich"" media broths that are available: SOB, SOC (SOB + MgCl<sub>2</sub> and sucrose), 2xYT, NZY+, TB, etc. All of these are superior to LB for transformation purposes because of the refined salt balance and in particular the inclusion of these di-valent and mono-valent cations. Sucrose seems to be included for the ease of metabolism and stability of the heat shock process (though I can't find a paper explicitly explaining why it is used, other than tradition).</p>

<p>The two most common ways to transform bacteria are to have them chemically compentent (E. coli already in a rich media broth) or to electrically transform them (electroporation). The purpose of both of these is to induce holes into to cell membrane of the E. coli (chemical transformation relies on the heat shock process for this). Once these holes are made, DNA is free to enter into the bacteria. Naturally, this process is very traumatizing to the E. coli, especially since chemical transformation has the added insult of temperature shock (0°C to 42°C then back down to 0°C).</p>

<p>Substituting LB for any rich broth, such as SOC, will greatly improve transformation yield. If a protocol calls for SOC media, and you don't have any, you may substitute for another rich media. I have used 2xYT for SOC many times quite successfully, and as I stated earlier, only the valence number for the various ions seems to matter, so just make sure they are present.</p>

<p>It was my understanding that sucrose/glucose was added as an additional nutrient source for E. coli to expedite their recovery from the transformation protocol. I speculate that this is the case. Hanahan refers to sucrose as a stabilizer but does not define what it is stabilizing. I speculate that it acts as a cryopreservation aid and prevents ice crystal formation when undergoing cooling on ice in the heat shock method. Given the earlier bio.SE question <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/1485/389"">about shifting E. coli feedstocks</a>, it seems unlikely that sucrose will be used as a nutrient source in the one hour growth period immediately after transformation because that article quotes 4-12 hours as the common time range to shift metabolism from amino acids to carbohydrates.</p>

"Why does human facial and head hair continue to grow?","38838","","<p>Many people can grow extremely long head hair and facial hair. Are there evolutionary theories as to why this is the case? It seems like having long hair could be a disadvantage, and extremely long hair seems to be rare in other mammals.</p>
","<p>How humans evolved to have head / beard hair that continues to grow longer than other animals is a topic that many anthropologists &amp; biologists are still not sure about &amp; there is no general consensus as to ""why"" yet.</p>

<p>The three main views that I am aware of however are : </p>

<p><strong>1) Evolution of the ""Aquatic Ape.""</strong> (Ingram, 2000: Morgan 1997; 1982) </p>

<ul>
<li>Infants, in order to hold onto their mothers in the water, would latch onto her hair. Limiting separation from the mother &amp; increasing chances of survivability</li>
<li>Longer hair meant that infants / small children would need to swim less in order to get to their mother</li>
<li>Believed to be supported even further when you consider that aquatic mammals are almost always hairless, indicating that at one point, humans were highly ""aquatic"" mammals.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2) No real benefit, but used as a tool for ""mate selection.""</strong> (Darwin, 1871; Cooper 1971)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The view held by many of the Darwin school of thought (I do not mean that as a derogatory), is that at first, ""hairiness"" was sexually attractive, but eventually ""hairlessness"" became more sexually attractive in most places (i.e. the face to see facial expressions &amp; socialize better; Wong &amp; Simmons 2001)</p></li>
<li><p>A sign of ""virility"" &amp; ""health"" as can be seen in the mate-selection behavior of lions. Which is true even today as human diagnostic material for health (Klevay, 1972).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3) Practical evolutionary benefits for the human species specifically</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>A lot of body heat escapes from the head, probably the most important part of your body. Hair is a good insulator that can keep in heat. This increases survivability in colder climates. (Wong &amp; Simmons 2001; Bubenick 2003). (A disputed but considered credible reason, especially when you compare hair length and types across different regions throughout history)</p></li>
<li><p>Protection against damaging UV rays (while still permitting adequate Vit.D3 to come through) &amp; some protection from free-radicals or other harmful particles. Because we became bi-pedal, the head was the main area exposed to the sun (as well as some of our back). Extending hair's usefulness to even hot environments, while other body hair became less important with the development of sweat glands (Wheeler 1985).</p></li>
<li><p>Heightened ""Situational Awareness"" through ""Touch sense."" A concept that may seem silly at first but has some evidence to support the theory. Though the hair is not ""alive,"" it is connected to the follicles &amp; your nerves. In a nutshell, it may help to increase ""sensory awareness"" &amp; ""data gathering"" of your environment, which would favor longer hair. This would be an asset in survivability (Kardong 2002; keratin.com 2010; Sabah 1974; washington.edu)</p></li>
<li><p>Though not a collegiate Journal article, if reasonably credible, this small article is an interesting case for supporting hair &amp; ""Touch sense"" in ""recent history"" &amp; in combat-survival : <a href=""http://www.sott.net/article/234783-The-Truth-About-Hair-and-Why-Indians-Would-Keep-Their-Hair-Long"">http://www.sott.net/article/234783-The-Truth-About-Hair-and-Why-Indians-Would-Keep-Their-Hair-Long</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I personally lean 90% ""Evolutionary benefits"" &amp; 10% ""Mate selection"" as to reasons why humans' hair continues to grow longer than other animals. Beard &amp; head.</p>

"Why is ATP the preferred choice for energy carriers?","38708","","<p>Why is ATP the most prevalent form of chemical energy storage and utilization in most cells?</p>
","<p>I really like this question as it is such a fundamental underpinning of all life on the planet, yet there is such sparsity of actual information on its origins and why selection rewarded ATP use over anything else. Here I am talking generally since no specific studies exist in ATP vs other candidates. </p>

<p>A lot of the below information is taken from a relatively old article mentioned in the comments by TomD that discusses: <em>""Why nature chose phosphates.""</em> <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2434996"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">by Westheimer, 1987</a>. The article is very influential and has been cited over a thousand times since publication. Another article that came out in the same year that this question was asked <em>""Why nature</em> <strong><em>really</em></strong> <em>chose phosphate.""</em> <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23318152"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">by Kamerlin <em>et al.,</em> 2013</a></p>

<p>Some of the below arguments are more convincing than others, but all of them should be thought of when attempting to answer this question.</p>

<h2>Summary.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Alternative phosphate groups or other molecules may not provide enough energy.</li>
<li>Alternatives may be toxic.</li>
<li>Other molecules, particularly phosphates, are used for inefficient high energy bursts. </li>
<li>ATP has ancestral dominance.</li>
<li>Pi is a ""good"" leaving group.</li>
<li>Phosphates are fundamentally able to be regulated through electrostatic manipulation.</li>
<li>ATP synthase can efficiently reattach the Pi to ADP.</li>
<li>Lots of Pi available to organisms because of it's ancestral dominance (""if it ain't broken, why fix it?"" is at play).</li>
<li>ATP can provide more energy if needed; it's scalable to the situation. (ADP becomes AMP + Pi)</li>
<li>Easily usable by a variety of proteins.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why ATP?</h1>

<p>ATP is an efficient and relatively easily biosynthesised molecule that can fulfil multiple biochemical roles. Cells do have alternative energy carriers, some with more specialised roles, however, ATP is ubiquitous throughout our cells and inter-cellular spaces. There aren't a wealth of resources explaining why ATP is any better than other compounds, however, there is plenty of reasons why the phosphates are required.</p>

<h1>Why not the alternatives?</h1>

<p>Citric acids and their derivatives are a good candidate, with deductible groups and high bioavailability but they simply don't give enough energy to stabilise genetic material. </p>

<p>Another tribasic candidate is arsenic acid. This is a fundamentally toxic compound, though, which isn't particularly great for living things. </p>

<p>There are other phosphates too, and they are used in many organisms. In biology, they have specific functions, and not used as the general energy carrier. For example, creatine triphosphate provides a high energy phospho- anhydride bond, that is often used to quickly and anaerobically regenerate ATP, useful during high rate muscle activity for contraction. </p>

<p>GTP is structurally very similar to ATP. GTPases are used more to initiate cellular signalling pathways. It is sometimes used as an energy source. This is a good example of an alternative energy carrier. </p>

<p>Over the years, many proteins have specialised with a specific shape, and this chance is the primary reason behind ATP over GTP. In other words, the choice of ATP over GTP is primarily down to cellular preference of molecular shape. One of them had to emerge as being more widely used, and it was ATP that 'won'.</p>

<h1>Efficiency and simplicity.</h1>

<p>The reaction was once thought to be a relatively simple nucleophilic displacement. From the 2013 paper: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...this simplicity is deceptive, as, even in aqueous solution, the low-lying d-orbitals on the phosphorus atom allow for eight distinct mechanistic possibilities, before even introducing the complexities of the enzyme catalysed reactions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Traditionally one will be taught that ATP is such a chemically efficient way of storing and transporting energy. This is due to the ATP->ADP &amp; Pi hydrolysis reaction. The phosphate groups in ATP are full of negative charges and these are repelling one another. This means that the third phosphate is <strong>a great leaving group</strong> and breaking the phospho- anhydride bond is a favourable reaction. ...</p>

<p><em>...But</em> the story is a lot more complicated than that. The above explanation isn't really satisfying because those same negative charge forces are repulsive of the nucleophile that is attempting to complete ATP->ADP &amp; Pi. A more comprehensive explanation would go along the lines of 'although a negative charge repulsion exists between the nucleophile of the protein and the phosphate, that high energy barrier can be overcome by electrostatic manipulation'. This allows an ""on-off switch"" for the hydrolytic reaction by tweaking the electrostatic environment. This is another great regulatory tool that the phosphates provide. This regulatory feature is important for signal and metabolic/catabolic cascades.</p>

<p>When it comes to 'rebinding' the Pi to ADP, it is fairly easy since ADP seldom covalently binds to anything, which would require a lot of energy to recover the ADP. This also helps the bioavailability of free ADP to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y1dO4nNaKY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ATP synthase</a>, an incredibly efficient enzyme, that uses membrane proton gradient to drive the production of ATP. Talking about actual numbers is difficult here as there is only data available from Rat hepatocytes. Who is to say mammals are representative of all organisms? The estimates of energy of hydrolysis range from <a href=""http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/better-biochemistry-free-energy-of-atp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ΔG˚ = -48 kJ mol-1</a> to <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/576/how-on-a-physical-level-does-atp-confer-energy?rq=1"">-30.5 kmol-1</a>. Note that these are considerable, but not exceptional values, so it's easy for many different proteins, that need not be very specialized, to break the bond all over the body. I couldn't even find the numbers for the synthase reaction per ATP, but a single ATP synthase can produce up to 600 ATP per minute.</p>

<p>The final point of this efficiency is that the elements in ATP are very abundant and established in the biosphere making it readily available. This makes the phosphates a convenient biomolecule.</p>

<h1>Multi-functionality.</h1>

<p>ATP is ubiquitous in the body, but in some cases more energy is needed than there are ATP available. In these times of need, ATP can be used to produce more energy, breaking another phosphoanhydride bond to become AMP+2Pi. AMP however is typically a signalling molecule.</p>

<p>With the low activation energy required to break the phosphoanhydride bond, a multitude of enzymes, far too many to list here, can make use of ATP in order to gain energy towards the activation energy for many other functions. </p>

","<p>The spots on the back of Ladybugs over the surface is defense mechanism to avoid predators. The spots come in different shapes and different numbers. Some say that those dots tell us their age.

<p>But the real truth about the number of spots on the ladybugs' back is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The number of spots on a ladybug does have significance. The spots and other markings do help you identify the species of ladybug. Some species have no spots at all. The record-holder for most spots is the 24-spot ladybug ( Subcoccinella 24-punctata), which has 24 spots, of course. Ladybugs aren't always red with black spots, either.

","<blockquote>
  <p>I want to know can +ve and -ve blood group of a couple could be a cause of miscarriage in pregnancy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong> In extreme cases, it can. You are talking about <strong>Rh Incompatibility</strong>, and can become a big issue when the mother has Rh(-) blood and the father has Rh(+) blood (such as the case with your cousin and his wife).</p>

<p>What <em>could have</em> happened (but definitely won't say for sure) is that your cousin's wife had a natural miscarriage which exposed her to the Rh proteins of the child, and then the subsequent pregnancy had complications due to the previous exposure and mother's development of antibodies which lead to the second miscarriage. However, <strong>I am not a licensed physician and you should consult a physician before pursuing any sort of treatments!!!</strong></p>

<p>Rh factor is the presence of surface proteins on Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells or ""RBC""). If Leukocytes (White Blood Cells - most commonly reported as ""T-cells"") encounter Erythrocytes that <em>do not share</em> the Rh factor of their host, then they can develop <em>antibodies</em> to it - which help identify Antigens (foreign proteins and molecules). Once the Antibodies have been generated the Immune System can attack any foreign Erythrocytes. </p>

<p>In this way, the mother's Immune System can actually attack the RBCs of her child.</p>

<p>You can find out more here: <a href=""http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_center/your_pregnancy/rh.html"">http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_center/your_pregnancy/rh.html</a></p>

<p>And a few select quotations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rh incompatibility usually isn't a problem if it's the mother's <strong>first</strong> pregnancy because, unless there's some sort of abnormality, the fetus's blood does not normally enter the mother's circulatory system during the course of the pregnancy...</p>
  
  <p>...Other ways Rh-negative pregnant women can be exposed to the Rh protein that might cause antibody production include blood transfusions with Rh-positive blood, <strong>miscarriage</strong>, and ectopic pregnancy...</p>
  
  <p>...Rh antibodies are harmless until the mother's second or later pregnancies. If she is ever carrying another Rh-positive child, her Rh antibodies will recognize the Rh proteins on the surface of the baby's blood cells as foreign, and pass into the baby's bloodstream and attack those cells. <strong>This can lead to swelling and rupture of the baby's RBCs. A baby's blood count can get dangerously low when this condition, known as hemolytic or Rh disease of the newborn, occurs.*</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you are correct that there is a treatment via injection, but the Doctor is also correct in that administering it past the first pregnancy does little for future fetuses:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, when a woman with the potential to develop Rh incompatibility is pregnant, doctors administer a series of two Rh immune-globulin shots during her first pregnancy. The first shot is given around the 28th week of pregnancy and the second within 72 hours after giving birth. Rh immune-globulin acts like a vaccine, preventing the mother's body from producing any potentially dangerous Rh antibodies that can cause serious complications in the newborn or complicate any future pregnancies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the ultimate effects of missing the shots and having very unfortunate luck:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rh incompatibility rarely causes complications in a first pregnancy and does not affect the health of the mother. But Rh antibodies that develop during subsequent pregnancies can be potentially dangerous to mother and child. Rh disease can result in severe anemia, jaundice, brain damage, and heart failure in a newborn. <strong>In extreme cases, it can cause the death of the fetus because too many RBCs have been destroyed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Is there a cure?</strong> No. Once the antibodies have been developed, the Rh(+) protein is <em>known</em> to the mother's Immune System. Nothing short of wiping out the mother's Immune System would act as a <em>cure</em>.</p>

<p>However, in extreme cases, there are treatments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a doctor determines that a woman has already developed Rh antibodies, then the pregnancy will be closely monitored to make sure that those levels are not too high. In rare cases, if the incompatibility is severe and the baby is in danger, a series of special blood transfusions (called exchange transfusions) can be performed either while the baby is still in the uterus or after delivery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>But don't fret yet!</strong></p>

<p>Rh surface proteins are determined by genetics, and each time a child is conceived there is a chance that the Rh protein will be (-) if the exact genotype of the (+) parent allows it. So if your cousin's wife were to get pregnant again (and each time she does) it's a chance that the Rh Incompatibility (aka - ""Hemolytic Disease"", aka - ""Rhesus Disease"") won't show up.</p>

<p>So there are some reasons to stay positive.</p>

"Why can't neurons undergo cell division?","37490","","<p>Many cells in the human body can divide and reproduce, making healing possible. Neurons, however, cannot reproduce, which makes diseases affecting the brain particularly crippling. Why can't neurons divide - that is, what makes them different from ""normal"" cells? Are there any ways to artificially stimulate neuron cell division?</p>
","<p><strong>Morphological point of view</strong></p>

<p>Neurons cannot divide because they lack <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centriole"">centrioles</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because centrioles function in cell division, the fact that neurons lack these organelles is consistent with the amitotic nature of the cell [1].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Functional point of view</strong></p>

<p>New cells in the nervous system wouldn't do any good. The whole nervous system is based on interneuronal connections, so adding an extra neuron would mess up these connections and alter both the functionality and the ""stored"" information.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each nerve cell has a specific place in our nervous system. Its job is all about taking a signal from one specific place to another one. Adding new nerve cells would mess up these very specific connections in a very complex system [2].</p>

"What factors affect the rate of transpiration in plant leaves?","36517","","<p>I'm trying to get my head around factors which affect transpiration in leaves.</p>

<p>For example, how would applying petroleum jelly to the surface of plant leaves affect their rate of transpiration?</p>

<p>I get that it's basically going to decrease the trasnpiration rate because the stomata will be covered, but I'm not sure about these parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>How would it affect the rate of transpiration if only the top surface was covered?</li>
<li>How would it affect the rate of transpiration if only the bottom surface was covered?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I think I'm right in saying that increasing wind / applying a fan to plant leaves will increase the transpiration rate, but why?</p>
","<p>The rate of transpiration is <em>very</em> closely linked with the rate of evaporation from the leaf surface.  Increased air movement across the surface of the leaf (e.g. from a fan) increases the rate of evaporation of water from the leaf surface. This happens because water saturated air is moved away; making the osmotic gradient more pronounced.  </p>

<p>As for the relative changes from adding an impermeable substance like petroleum jelly to the top and bottom surfaces of leaves, it's a question of plant-anatomy.  In the majority of plants, stomata are only located on the bottom surface of the leaf.  This is to prevent them getting 'clogged' during rainfall and to keep them out of the sun to minimise water loss (again more sunlight on the stomata would increase the rate of evaporation).  Therefore a plant with the underside covered would have a much slower rate of transpiration than one with the top surface of the leaf covered. </p>

<p>Other factors that would affect the rate of transpiration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Temperature (Positive Correlation) </li>
<li>Humidity (Negative Correlation)</li>
<li>Light Availability <em>Excluding CAM photosynthesis pathway plants</em> (Positive Correlation - the stomata are in the main only open when photosynthesis is occurring, so transpiration is less at night or on a cloudy day in addition to light  heating the leaf surface)</li>
<li>Water content of soil (Positive Correlation)
<ul>
<li>amount of salt in soil (negative correlation)</li>

"Hoechst or DAPI for nuclear staining?","36360","","<p>When is it best to use Hoechst vs. DAPI for nuclear staining? They seem to be very similar on paper. Are there situations where one is clearly preferable?</p>
","<p>The Hoechst 33342 dye is similar to DAPI in that both are UV-excited, minor groove-binding, and emit signals proportional to total DNA content. Both are maximally excited around 355 nm and emit around 460 nm.  A UV light source is required, which may harm the cell. However, this is only a risk with Hoechst, as DAPI requires the cells to be fixed and/or permeabilized, which is incompatible with life. DAPI is more stable, but Hoechst is brighter. Both are subject to photo-bleaching after long exposure.</p>

<p>There is another newer DNA dye called DRAQ5 that makes up for all of the issues I mentioned earlier - it is bright, quite photo-stable, can be used in live cell imaging, and its excitation and emission wavelengths are in the far red end of the spectrum, meaning that no UV is needed.

","<p>Nice question which leads to the fundamentals of DNA and RNA.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DNA</a> (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the core of life in Earth, every known living organism is using DNA as their genetic backbone. DNA is so precious and vital to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eukaryotes</a> that its kept packaged in cell nucleus, its being copied but never removed because it never leaves the safety of nucleus. DNA directs all cell activity by delegating it to RNA. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RNA</a> (Ribonucleic acid ) have varied sort of biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA carries messages out of the cell nucleus to cytoplasm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The structure of RNA nucleotides is very similar to that of DNA nucleotides, with the main difference being that the ribose sugar backbone in RNA has a hydroxyl (-OH) group that DNA does not. This gives DNA its name: DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. Another minor difference is that DNA uses the base thymine (T) in place of uracil (U). Despite great structural similarities, DNA and RNA play very different roles from one another in modern cells.</p>

<li>RNA contains Uracil in place of Thymine</li>

<h2>Ribose and Deoxyribose</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TvpOf.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the fig above we can see that the principal difference between
  the two molecules is the presence of OH in ribose (2' tail) and absence
  in deoxyribose. There is a difference in one Oxygen atom as the name
  stands de-oxy ribose. Both Ribose and deoxyribose have an Oxygen(O)
  atom  and a Hydrogen (H) atom (an OH group) at their 3' sites. The OH
  groups are very reactive in nature, so the 3' OH tail is required for
  phosphodiester bonds to form between <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nucleotides</a> in both ribose
  and deoxyribose atoms.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>

<p>DNA is such an important molecule so it must be protected from decomposition and further reactions. The absence of one Oxygen is the key for extending DNA's longevity. When the 2' Oxygen is absent in deoxyribose, the sugar molecule is less likely to get involved in chemical reactions( the aggressive nature of Oxygen in chemical reactions are famous). <strong>So by removing the Oxygen from deoxyribose molecule, DNA avoids being broken down</strong>. In an RNA's point of view the Oxygen is helpful, unlike DNA, RNA is a short-term tool used by the cell to send messages and manufacture proteins as a part of gene expression. Simply speaking mRNA (Messenger RNA) has the duties of turning genes ON and OFF, when a gene needed to be put ON mRNA is made and to keep it OFF the mRNA is removed. So <strong>the OH group in 2' is used to decompose the RNA quickly thereby making those affected genes in OFF state.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, <strong>the ribose sugar is placed in RNA for easily decomposing it and DNA uses deoxyribose sugar for longevity.</strong></p>

"How can Valonia ventricosa cells get so big?","36305","","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valonia_ventricosa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Valonia ventricosa</em></a> are single-celled algae that range between one and few centimetres. In rare cases, they can reach sizes exceeding 5cm. They range from grass-green to dark green, and some are even a blackish colour.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PRTcqm.jpg"" alt=""Picture of large speherical Valonia ventricosa.""></p>

<p>Weirdly, a lot of the literature covering these organisms seems to be pre-1950. <a href=""http://www.leeds.ac.uk/heritage/Astbury/bibliography/Astbury_and_Preston_1937.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This X-ray crystallography project in 1937</a> identified key structures in the cell wall of <em>V. ventricosa</em>:</p>

  variable positions between. The development of the rhizoids has been
  investigated and found to be associated with regions of the wall
  adjacent to the poles of the spiral. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the authors hesitate to speculate on their function, has any progress in the field suggested the fibres identified in this <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v162/n4121/abs/162665a0.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1948 Nature paper</a> be involved in sustaining such a massive cell (Figure below)?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/h3axTm.png"" alt=""Fibrous surface of cell.""></p>

<p>So it seems like the cell wall structure has been categorised long ago. But <strong>what allows these single-celled organisms to get so big?</strong> Is it the plant-like cell wall, or something else? I was under the impression that cells would burst or collapse well before reaching this size.</p>
","<p><em>Ventricaria ventricosa</em> (previously called <em>Valonia ventricosa</em>) is not exactly a single cell. It has a coenocytic structure with multiple nuclei and chloroplasts. As Jasand Pruski correctly guessed the organism possesses a large central vacuole which is multilobular in structure (lobules radiating from a central spheroid region). </p>

<p>The entire cell contains several ""cytoplasmic domains"" with each domain having a nucleus and a few chloroplasts (See the figure below). Cytoplasmic domains are interconnected by cytoplasmic ""bridges"" that are supported by microtubules (like in axons). The peripheral cytoplasm (whose membrane is overlaid by the cell wall), is only about 40nm thick.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PrARe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

</blockquote>

<p>So these are not huge cellular balloons that can burst easily. Nonetheless a huge structure like this is susceptible to injuries by shearing forces of water currents and by other organisms like fish which may try to feed on them. These organisms have some mechanisms other than the cytoplasmic organization that allows them to cope up with injuries:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the outer membrane ruptures, then the cytoplasm contracts with the help of actin filaments that are attached to the former. Subsequently the membrane fuses, protoplasts form and then cell wall is regenerated. This movement is likely to be triggered by extracellular calcium.</p></li>
<li><p>A single cytoplasmic domain with nucleus and other essential organelles can regenerate an entire organism. </p></li>
<li><p>A muclilagenous layer made up of sulphated polysaccharides coats both the vacuolar and extracellular surfaces. During injury it impedes the movement of water and ions (by retaining them in the form of a gel) and therefore acts like a plug.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Other organisms like this (siphonous algae) also have similar mechanisms. Some even employ calcium carbonate to maintain rigidity.</p>

"Glomerular Filtration Rate","35937","","<p>In practice, when you have vasoconstriction of the glomerular capillaries and subsequently an increase in blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate increases. However, this seems counterintuitive to Bernoulli's principle. </p>

<p>During vasoconstriction, because the radii of the capillaries are getting smaller, we should expect an increase in flow rate and blood velocity. According to Bernoulli's principle, the outward hydrostatic pressure should drop. </p>

<p>How does this lead to an increase in filtration rate?</p>
","<p>The previous answer isn't quite correct, because, well, blood flow is complicated and the body has autoregulatory mechanisms. As Alex mentioned, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vasoconstriction</a> doesn't occur in capillaries because they lack a muscle layer. It does occur in the small arterioles before and after the glomerulus (the afferent and efferent arterioles, respectively).</p>

<p>Bernoulli's principle mainly applies to larger arteries and arterioles, and not capillaries. Capillaries are so tiny that the red blood cell is a significant portion of the diameter, so the assumption of no viscosity is no longer valid. See <a href=""http://www.physicsforums.com/archive/index.php/t-207950.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this discussion</a> for an explanation.</p>

<p>To address your question, here's a basic picture of the glomerulus, from Gray's Anatomy.
<img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Gray1129.png"" alt=""image""></p>

<p>The afferent arteriole is in red, and the efferent arteriole in blue. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) depends on the pressure difference between the two, which affects the hydrostatic pressure at the glomerulus. Also, note that vasodilation has the opposite effect of vasoconstriction on GFR.  (For a nice image and explanation, look at <a href=""http://alexandria.healthlibrary.ca/documents/notes/bom/unit_2/L-51%20Renal%20Clearances%20%20GFR%20and%20Renal%20iqbglo.xml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Figure 6 here</a>) So:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Constriction of the <strong>afferent</strong> arteriole decreases the blood flow <em>into</em> the glomerulus and thus the glomerular hydrostatic pressure, which leads to a <strong>decrease</strong> in GFR.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast, constriction of the <strong>efferent</strong> arteriole decreases blood flow <em>out</em> of the glomerulus, and this increases the glomerular hydrostatic pressure and leads to an <strong>increase</strong> in GFR.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both the afferent and efferent arterioles are regulated through hormones (and drugs that inhibit the hormones). Prostaglandins dilate the afferent arterioles, and NSAIDs inhibit this action. Angiotensin II preferentially constricts the efferent arteriole, and this action is restricted by an ACE inhibitor. (Source: First Aid for the USMLE Step 1)</p>

"Why is cold water more refreshing than warm water?","35371","","<p>Obviously, the temperature of water does not affect its chemical composition. At least not in the ranges we are likely to drink it in. Yet it is clearly far more pleasant and refreshing to drink cool water than it is to drink tepid or warm water.</p>

<p>Is there actually any difference to the organism or is this just a matter of perception? Is cool water somehow more efficient at rehydrating a cell? In any case, surely by the time water reaches individual cells it will have warmed up to body temperature. </p>

<p>So, what, if any, is the difference between drinking cool and warm water in terms of its effect on the human (or other animal) body?</p>

<p>Extra bonus for explaining why the <em>taste</em> of water changes when it is cold.</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: Cold is pleasant only when your are not already freezing and cold might satiate thirst better because it acts as enhancer of the ""water intake flow meter"".</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Is cold water more tasty than warm water?</strong> No, it is actually the reverse as detailed in my footnote.</p>

<p>Cold is pleasant when your body is over-heating and definitely not if you live naked in the North Pole. Over-heating means sweating which means you loose water and therefore feel thirsty faster. Yet drinking cold water will not rehydrate the body more than warm water and drinking water has only a very small impact on the body temperature. So why do we like it?</p>

<p>A study was actually conducted on the subject and answers most of your questions. <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666313003930#"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here the reference</a>. </p>

<p><strong>The temperature of the body will indeed not change</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cold stimuli applied to the mouth
  (internal surface of the body) do not appear to impact on body
  temperature and are not reported to cause any reflex shivering
  or skin vasoconstriction that influence body temperature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you pointed out, the temperature of the ingested water will <strong>not affect the overall hydration of the body</strong> as cells are rehydrated mostly via the blood  stream and the blood temperature will not be affected. Someone could argue that, at identical volumes, cold water (above 4C) contains more molecules (i.e. is denser) than warm water but this difference is likely very slim.</p>

<p>In this paper they also define ""thirst"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thirst is a homeostatic mechanism that regulates blood osmolarity
  by initiating water intake when blood osmolarity increases</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that it takes some time before the water reaches the blood stream, and therefore you need a feedback mechanism that tells you to stop drinking independently of the blood's osmolarity. This is where cold might play a role.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cold stimulus to the mouth from ingestion of water may act
  as a satiety signal to meter water intake and prevent excessive
  ingestion of water</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The picture would then be the following
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BgAON.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In essence, a cold sensation is pleasant in warm weather, both on the skin and in the mouth, and it apparently helps in reducing thirst by being some kind of an  enhancer of the ""water intake flow meter"".</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Footnote</strong></p>

<p>Reading the comments I just want to clarify some points.</p>

<p>The 5 basic tastes (sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami) are very distinct from taste sensations (pungency, smoothness, cooling to name a few). The main difference is that taste and ""sensation"" signals use completely different paths to reach the brain - namely, the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves for the former and the trigeminal nerve for the latter.</p>

<p>Is the temperature affecting basic taste perceptions? The answer is <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/nature04248.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">yes</a>. How this happens is quite simple if you understand the fundamental concepts of molecular taste perception. Essentially the temperature affects the response of the receptor TRPM5 which is the main player in depolarizing taste receptor cells in the papillae. To put it simply, higher temperatures provoke a greater perception for taste, and this is not only in term of perceived taste but really modifies the amplitude of the response at the molecular level. As an example this is why ice cream does not taste sweet when frozen but only after it melted in the mouth or on the tongue.</p>

","<p>The reason that Archaea were determined to be a separate (and only the third) kingdom so late (<a href=""http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/archaea/archaea.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1977 according to this reference</a>) was because archaea often completely resemble eubacteria.  They are unicellular and have no organelles and appropriately they were grouped with other prokaryotes because of their morphology and cellular physiology.  </p>

<p>But by the 1970s phylogeny becoming based on the sequence of DNA and RNA which were just becoming more available.  Based on a simple comparison of the sequences of 18S rRNA of 13 fungi, bacteria and archaea, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC432104/pdf/pnas00033-0388.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Woese and Fox showed that the bacteria and the archaea were about as different from the eukaryotes than from the bacteria</a>.

<p>Since then, the differences between bacteria and archaea have continued to be great.  The wikipedia diagram below is not to scale- the divergence of the three kingdoms is so far back that they pre-date the emergence of eukaryotes entirely. But you can see that fungi and other eukaryotes are more similar to archaea than the bacteria.  </p>

<p>BTW, the idea that archaea are extremophiles is not entirely true - they are pretty much exclusively the only kingdom found in these conditions, but archaea have been found to coexist with bacteria and eukaryotes <a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/S7/S29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in the open sea</a> and their detection heretofore in most environments may be only due to the fact that archaea are difficult to grow in the lab.  </p>

</ul>
","<p>Long story short, the astronaut probably wouldn't make it, and would first loose consciousness then suffocate.</p>

<p>There is a lot of myth and hollywood dramatization regarding this kind of thing. Here are some:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You will explode.</strong> This is just ridiculous. The skin is air tight (relatively speaking). It is also very elastic and can pull and bend quite a great deal before tearing. Through quite a few, equally durable, tissues, it is connected to the bones, which are unaffected by negative air pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Your blood will boil.</strong> The circulatory system is also a closed system. It is not directly exposed to the environment. Also, the blood pressure in a healthy person is averaged around 100 mmHg and Earth's atmosphere at sea level is 700 mmHg. There is already a massive disparity, yet Earth's atmosphere doesn't go pouring into our veins at random. Likewise, the blood in a person's veins won't go pouring out into the atmosphere simply because the pressure is extremely low.</li>
<li><strong>Any air in your lungs will be forcibly sucked out of you.</strong> Again, this is a closed system, if you hold your breath. As long as you don't try to breathe there is nothing forcing the air from your lungs.</li>
<li><strong>Your eyes will be sucked from their sockets</strong>. Thank you <em>Total Recall</em> (the original) for this myth. The eyes are very firmly in place. You might feel a pull on them, but they aren't going anywhere.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Absolutely none of these would happen in the vacuum of space and certainly not on the Martian surface.</strong></p>

<h2>Here's what <em>will</em> happen:</h2>

<p>Any liquid material on the surface of your body will vaporize. All sweat, saliva (if you open your mouth), water in the mucous, and tears on the eyes, will nearly instantly vaporize. It would be quite uncomfortable, especially the eyes, but very survivable. Long term exposure to a vacuum might damage the eyes eventually, but in this scenario there are far more pressing matters.</p>

<p>The negative pressure may also cause your eardrums to rupture. Try to imagine the feeling your ears get on the plane at 30 thousand feet times about 100. Since you can't close your ears, plugging them with your fingers may help, but likely just postpone the inevitable pressure disparity, which will lead to at least great discomfort and possible drum rupture.</p>

<p>If you had the chance, you should take a deep breath before jumping out and avoid trying to breathe at all costs. Opening your lungs for a breath would very quickly draw whatever breath you had in them out into the atmosphere and also vaporize any fluid that was in them. Considering the rapid pace of this event, you would surely have permanent damage from this and begin suffocating and will die in a minute or two unless you get medical attention. There seems to be conflict in the procedure for this, with some sources suggesting that emptying your lungs would be better to avoid this. Considering the astronaut in your example is about to do a 200 meter dash he is going to need all the O<sub>2</sub> he can get.</p>

<p>The cold is also a treacherous factor. At -50C the heat from your body would dissipate so rapidly that it would likely be very debilitating, perhaps causing you to seize up and clutch your extremities to your chest. It would also be excruciatingly painful. It might cause you to fall into shock. In a total vacuum however, this does not exist. A vacuum is actually very insulating, but on Mars' what little atmosphere is there is enough for you to feel the chill.</p>

<p>The lack of oxygen and high CO<sub>2</sub> would be what would eventually kill you. You would eventually try to breathe and loose consciousness within a breath or two (or you might loose consciousness first then your body would try to breathe naturally). Your body would try to keep you alive as long as possible by pumping your heart faster and increasing your blood pressure, but your heart would eventually fail and you would die within seconds after that.</p>

<h2>Evaluating your particular scenario</h2>

<p>There are first a few things about the scenario that seem unlikely.</p>

<ol>
<li>The astronaut would not be naked. They remain in some of their protective gear in case of emergencies like this. He would have some protection against the cold if he had to run out without it.</li>
<li>Certain things like extinguishers are always nearby. The idea that one was unreachable is a little silly.</li>
<li>Space vehicles, shuttles, and buildings all are compartmentalized like a submarine. They could simply close off the affected areas.</li>
<li>Fire only burns in the presence of oxygen (with few exceptions). After being closed off, compartments can be decompressed, halting the fire immediately. They can then begin refilling them with breathable atmosphere. This poses the same vacuum problem if the astronaut is in the affected area, but he won't be trying to run across the surface naked. People have survived rapid decompressions before without a single injury, as listed in my second source, however, others have never regained consciousness.</li>
<li>Assuming you made it to the other building, they usually only open from the inside. So unless someone saw you coming and opened the door for you, your last minutes would be better spent desperately fighting the fire until it consumed you rather than banging on the neighbor's door.</li>
</ol>

<p>But let's say all of this breaks down and poor Astronaut Joe finds himself making a mad, streaker's dash across the Martian surface.</p>

<p>We should assume that our astronaut is both quite athletic and knowledgeable about the environment outside of his shelter, knowing that he should take a deep breath before heading out, but literally has no time to grab a shirt, goggles, breathing mask, or anything. Just him and Mars.</p>

<p>If he's lucky, it's not too cold and he doesn't seize up and fall into the fetal position within a few steps. Let's say it's -20C, which is pretty darn cold, but tolerable for a minute or two. I next see him flailing across the surface, trying to run in Mars' low gravity (no easy task). He begins to loose vision as a cloud of steam of what should be tears pours from his dry eyes. His eyelids then begin to stick to his eyeballs because there is no longer any lubrication. He is desperate to reach the other building, and his movements get more and more erratic, as his body is rapidly using all of the available oxygen. All the while, he is still holding his breath, knowing that if he attempts to breathe he will likely collapse within seconds and perish. But the more he struggles to make it, the more his innate urge to breathe overpowers his conscious thought to prevent it. Eventually, against his own willpower, he gasps and attempts to inhale deeply. He takes two or three dying breaths, if they can be called that, then falls to the ground unconscious. He dies shortly after when his heart stops and his brain tissues die.</p>

<p>The whole ordeal lasts under 30 seconds and he is 100 meters at most away from his shelter. If he did get lucky and actually made it to the other building, he would likely have frostbite over much of his body, permanent damage to his eyes and ears, and possibly deadly exposure to cosmic rays.</p>

<p>The event would be very similar to being drug by a fishing line to the bottom of the sea and drowning.</p>

"What is the cause of muscle cramps?","34974","","<p>According to Wikipedia, muscle cramps are caused by the inability of myosin fibers to break free from the actin filaments during contraction, resulting in a prolonged contraction.</p>

<p>A lack of ATP would obviously produce cramping, as myosin requires ATP to become free from actin.</p>

<p>However, I have heard that potassium and sodium are useful for treating cramps and that their deficiencies can lead to cramping.</p>

<p>So, how does a deficiency in sodium or potassium result in the inability of myosin fibers to break free from the actin filaments during contraction?</p>
","<p>The quick and simple answer:</p>

<p>Cramps of a hypokalemic origin are much more common than those of a hyponatremic origin because the Na-K pump is more effective at moving potassium in comparison to sodium.
At the onset of a muscle contraction, the presence of calcium triggers the opening of the Na-K channels in the membrane. Potassium is a calcium inhibitor, so as the potassium flows out of the cell, it eventually reduces the presence of calcium. This causes the closure of the Na-K channel (negative feedback mechanism). In a hypokalemic state, the lack of sufficient K doesn't inhibit the calcium channel, and in turn doesn't properly terminate the muscle contraction at the cellular level. </p>

<p>The continued presence of calcium, which has a lot to do with nerve impulses, means that the nerves keep firing, and in some cases such as a 'charlie horse', these impulses fire fast and continuously. The body at this point is reaching a small local state of metabolic acidosis resulting from the extremely high oxygen consumption, increasing levels of CO₂ (the acidosis component) and reducing blood partial oxygen levels. Since the oxygen is no longer as abundant as it was, it inhibits the bodies ability to locally produce the ribose and phosphate necessary for ATP. Less ATP = more myosin that can't be disconnected from actin = continued muscle cramp.</p>

"Mitosis in human body","34926","","<p>I've heard that stomach lining has the fastest reproducing cells and the brain has the slowest.</p>

<p>Where in the human body does mitosis occur and at what rates do these cell reproduce? Is there a chart for the whole body available?</p>
","<p>In many cases cell division depends on the stage of development an organism is in. The rate of cell division is obviously much faster in a developing organism and from what I understand fully differentiated cells such as neuron and those in skeletal muscles don't divide (correct me if I'm wrong here).  </p>

<p>In early development totipotent cells (stem cells that can become anything) begin to differentiate dependent on environmental factors, turning into multipotent (partially differentiated) cells that can only lead to certain cell types. For example: mesodermal precursors can differentiate to myoblasts, which can go on to differentiate into myotubes, later forming muscles. </p>

<p>Epithelial and and blood cells are the two of the main types of cells that need to be constantly replaced in developed organisms. As far as I know cells lining the gut epithelium are fastest to divide. They are created from stem cells in 'crypts' (pockets) in the lining and are pushed outwards, where they are later broken down (by what I would assume would be abrasion and intestinal juices). My book gives them a lifespan of 3-5 days. External skin cells are much slower to divide (though I'n not sure by exactly how much). </p>

<p>Red blood cells have have a lifespan of approximately 120 days. They are replenished by stem cells in the marrow of certain bones (e.g. a femur). Neutrophils are the next most common blood cell, with a circulating life of 8 hours (but lifespan may be a few days). Per day, roughly equal numbers of RBCs and neutrophils are created and are most numerous new cells created per day. Lymphocytes, another white blood cell, are responsible for immune 'memory' can persist for years. The fastest recorded mitotic cycle for a mammalian cell (in culture) is ~8-10hrs.</p>

"How does cerebrospinal fluid circulate in the central nervous system?","34554","","<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced in the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles and in the 4th ventricle of the brain.  CSF then circulates through the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoid space of the meninges.  CSF is returned to the venous system via the arachnoid granulations connecting the subrachnoid space with the superior sagittal sinus at the superior portion of the neurocranium.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What circulates the CSF such that it can return to the venous system against gravity?  </p></li>
<li><p>In other words, why does CSF not all just pool in the caudal cistern?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>There are several points here.</p>

<p><strong>Arachnoid granulations are not the only ""sinks"" for CSF.</strong></p>

<p>Even though it is true that most of the CSF is eliminated from ventricular system and subarachnoid space through these granulations, there are also suggestions that there are also other potential mechanism of shunting CSF into the venous system:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Cranial nerves leaving CNS go through <em>dura mater</em> and these holes are not sealed, so it is suggested that some CSF can just go along the nerves and then accumulate in the lymphatic nodes in submucus. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Dura mater</em> is mostly perforated at the area of <em>lamina cribrosa</em>, that basically separates the nasal holes and our brain. Leaking through multiple small holes here CSF is accumulated into the lymphatic submucusal nodes, found in abundance here. <em>This way is considered to be primary CSF drainage way in newborns who don't have a well developed granularities in (sub)arachnoid space.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Spinal nerves, especially in the upper part of the spinal cord, also leave unsealed holes and the presence of lymphatic nodes adjacent to the places where these nerves leave the verterbral column also make them a potential place for CSF drainage.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Arachnoid granularitis do not only drain, they are capable of active CSF uptake.</strong></p>

<p>CFS is not just ""circulating"" here going from the place of its origin in lateral ventricles to venous system. The granularities are here to actively resorb this fluid, meaning that they effectively take it up forming vacuoles and then excrete it to the venous system. Constant uptake leads to the pressure gradient (see also below!) that acts as a driving force for CSF.</p>

<p><strong>Venous system has generally low pressure, thus sucking the CSF up to drainage points.</strong></p>

<p>Speaking about drainage we also should consider the fact that the venous system has a pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure and much lower than pressure in any middle-sized arterial vessels. This is reached by having elastic walls and by transmitting the negative pressure from the mediastinum during the inhale, when the diaphragm and the thorax expand. This negative pressure propagates mostly to the connected vessels, including sinus system. Due to the elastic wall other parts of venous system can accommodate this negative pressure constrict their lumen, but not the sinus system which has a hard external framework formed by <em>dura mater</em> and bones. That is here we can measure the lowest pressure and this is the pressure that sucks CSF in into the venous system.</p>

<p>When the pH gets closer to the enzyme's pH optimum, the enzyme activity also increases. I would like to know why? </p>

<p>Unlike temperature change, I do not think this has much to do with energy. Does pH-related changes in enzymatic activity have something to do with the active site? </p>
","<p>Enzymes have a more or less narrow optimal pH at which they work, depending on the conditions of their environment. Pepsin for example is active in the stomach which is pretty acidic and has an optimal pH of 2.0, while Trypsin, which is active in the small intestine has an optimal pH around 8.5.</p>

<p>Changes in the pH first affect the form of the protein, hydrogen bonds between the amino acids of the molecule and so on and also the form of the active center of the enzyme. Small changes in pH do little or nothing, then reversible changes occur and finally the enzyme gets irreversibly denaturated.</p>

<p>The relationship between enzyme activity and pH always looks like this (the curve can be steeper, if the optimal range is small and broader if the range is wider):</p>

"Why do Humans not produce Vitamin C like other mammals?","33406","","<p>Why do most mammals produce their own Vitamin C?</p>

<p>Why do Humans not?</p>
","<p>Humans do not produce Vitamin C due to a mutation in the GULO (gulonolactone oxidase) gene, which results in the inability to synthesize the protein.  Normal GULO is an enzyme that catalyses the reaction of D-glucuronolactone with oxygen to L-xylo-hex-3-gulonolactone.  This then spontaneously forms Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).  However without the GULO enzyme, no vitamin C is produced.</p>

<p>This has not been selected against in natural selection as we are able to consume more than enough vitamin C from our diet.  It is also suggested that organisms without a functional GULO gene have a method of ""recycling"" the vitamin C that they obtain from their diets using red blood cells (see <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cell.2008.01.042"">Montel-Hagen et al. 2008</a>). </p>

"Do humans have enough biological differences to be grouped into races or subspecies?","32688","","<p>After my online research on the subject, I learnt that, biologically speaking, many scientists believe that there is no such thing as a race. <em>Homo sapiens</em> as a species is only 200,000 years old, which has not allowed for any significant genetic diversification yet, and our DNA is 99.99% similar. I've read statements that there can be more genetic variation inside a racial group than between different racial groups, meaning that, for example, two individuals from the same ""race"" can have less in common with each other than with an individual from another ""race"".</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_classification)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia on Race (human classification) quote</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Q1:</strong> If <em>Homo sapiens</em> has no races (according to biologists), why are we so different morphologically? (hair/eyes/skin colour and even athletic performance seem to differ between human populations)</p>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> Is it common for other species too, when genetically close populations have very different morphological traits? Are there any other mammal or animal species that exhibit biological diversity comparable to human diversity, and how do taxonomists treat these species? (excluding intentionally bred domestic species to keep the comparison fair)</p>

<hr>

<p><em>The question has been paraphrased to emphasize that it is the <strong>biological</strong> debate that is in question, not the <strong>sociopolitical</strong>. I.e., why is there no consensus in evidence and opinions of scientists?</em></p>
","<p>Firstly, it's not true that you can't tell racial background from DNA. You most certainly can; it's quite possible to give fairly accurate phenotypic reconstruction of the features we choose as racial markers from DNA samples alone and also possible to identify real geographic ancestral populations from suitable markers.</p>

<p>The reason that human races aren't useful is that they're actually only looking at a couple of phenotypic markers and (a) these phenotypes don't map well to underlying genetics and (b) don't usefully model the underlying populations. The big thing that racial typing is based on is skin colour, but skin colour is controlled by only a small number of alleles. On the basis of skin colour you'd think the big division in human diversity is (and I simplify) between white Europeans and black Africans. However, there is <em>vastly</em> more genetic diversity within Africa than there is anywhere else. Two randomly chosen Africans will be, on average, more diverse from each other than two randomly chosen Europeans. What's more Europeans are no more genetically distinct overall from a randomly chosen African than two randomly chosen Africans are from each other.</p>

<p>This makes perfectly decent sense if you consider the deep roots of diversity within Africa (where humans originally evolved) to the more recent separation of Europeans from an African sub-population.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the phenotypic markers of race don't actually tell you much about underlying heredity; for example there's a famous photo of twin daughters one of whom is completely fair skinned, the other of whom is completely dark skinned; yet these two are sisters. This is, of course, an extreme example but it should tell you something about the usefulness of skin colour as a real genetic marker. </p>

Without muscular coordination the cockroach cannot right itself and eventually dies in its upside down-position.</p>

"Why should plants transform glucose into sucrose before transporting it to other parts?","30822","","<p>I've learned that plants transform glucose into sucrose before sending it into phloem. But the process seems to be complex and energy comsuming. Why should plants do it? Is it really necessary?</p>
","<p>Glucose, fructose and galactose are the three dietary monosaccharides. Glucose and Fructose are  simple monosaccharides found in plants. A monosaccharide is the basic unit of carbohydrate and the simplest form of sugar, glucose are aldose and Fructose are ketose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the carbonyl is at position 1 (that is, n or m is zero), the molecule begins with a formyl group H(C=O)-, and is technically an aldehyde. In that case, the compound is termed an aldose. Otherwise, the molecule has a keto group, a carbonyl -(C=O)- between two carbons; then it is formally a ketone, and is termed a ketose. Ketoses of biological interest usually have the carbonyl at position 2.
  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosaccharide"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosaccharide</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whereas Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose. A disaccharide is more complex than monosaccharide, more complex compounds like oligosaccharides and polysaccharides exists. Sucrose synthesised within the cytosol of photosynthesizing cells is then available for general distribution and is commonly trans located to other carbon-demanding centers via the phloem.</p>

<p>Sucrose and starch are more efficient in energy storage when compared to glucose and fructose, but starch is insoluble in water. So it can't be transported via phloem and the next choice is sucrose, being water soluble and energy efficient sucrose is chosen to be the carrier of energy from leaves to different part of the tree. Another problem exists,   glucose is highly reactive and this may result in some intermediate reactions while transporting glucose. Being a complex structure, sucrose is not as much reactive as glucose. So plants uses the sucrose as a medium to transfer energy. Inside the cells, sucrose is converted back to glucose and fructose. Energy is yielded when it is needed. So plants transfer glucose and fructose in the form of sucrose in order to:</p>

","<p>In general, sweating is caused by too much heat, even if you're not aware of the heat. This can happen if the bowel moves and so raises the core temperature. Such movement is often accompanied with sweating, and since you only feel the normal temperature on the skin, it is <strong>cold sweat</strong>. But at the same time your core is hot so you think it's cold, but it will later mix to normal.</p>

<p>Anyway, it points to unusual bowel movement. This can be due to food allergy or, in a milder form, in food intolerances which are quite common. When it comes to sour ingredients, they are often in fruits, so I'll make a shot in the blue and say that you have a food intolerance against some fruits. You can check this hypothesis by trying chemically pure acetic acid to sour your food. If that doesn't result in sweat/hotness then it's probably the fruits.</p>

","<p>You are missing some knowledge here for sure, photosynthesis is a little complicated at A level, so I will describe it in brief.</p>

<p>During photosynthesis electrons and protons (A hydrogen atom without the electron) are required for a process called the electron transport chain and proton motive force. This happens during the light dependent stage of photosynthesis, (there is also a second light-independent stage called the Calvin cycle, and that is where the CO$_2$ is used), I won't go into detail about what the protons and electrons do (unless you want me to) but you need to know that these come from a water molecule, the water is split using light (photolysis, literally: cutting with light) into two hydrogens and half an oxygen molecule (or an oxygen atom). The oxygen that was released in photolysis is not required for the rest of the pathway, so it diffuses out of the cell.</p>

<p>For why it doesn't come from carbon dioxide, you need to consider the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is converted to glucose by enzymes, using products from the light dependent stage, so 6CO$_2$ are combined over six cycles to form one molecule of glucose. So that is where the CO$_2$ is used as well. </p>

<p>Both types of channels are critical for proper activation of the post synaptic neuron. The pre synaptic neuron releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, these neurotransmitters then bind to the ligand gated channels, thus activating them. The ligand gated channels open up and allow the influx of sodium, which depolarizes the cell. This depolarization activates nearby voltage gated ion channels, which open up and let in even more sodium. Voltage gated sodium channels open up one region at a time, the previous region providing enough depolarization to activate the next regions voltage gated channels. This effectively allows the action potential to propagate through the cell.</p>

","<p>Infrared wavelengths are EM waves of longer wavelengths than visible light. Also, visible waves are more energetic than IR waves.</p>

<p>Because of this, Visible light has the ability to excite organic receptor molecules in our eyes called Rods and Cones. These molecules stimulate cell responses and in turn excite cell responses in our nerves called an Action Response. Still unclear to most scientists is how the brain composes these action responses into an image, though a great deal of research is being done to date.</p>

<p>The reason why ""nothing happens"" when we aim infrared lights into our eyes (which I still wouldn't suggest) is that the photoreceptor molecules that we use to see don't have the necessary bonding configuration to accept the energy from these impinging EM waves.
<br> However, don't go thinking that nothing happens. Infrared radiation is a type of radiation that is usually a measurable heat source. IR is one of the broader parts of the EM spectrum. My point is to say, that when you ""radiate"" some thing with an IR source:
<br>1) You don't know if it is also radiating other EM waves unless you know the specs. 
<br>2) You're still exciting molecules with that energy even if it isn't causing a seen effect. I highly doubt anything will happen unless you have a very high powered IR source.

"How do the brain and nerves create electrical pulses?","29326","","<p>I have heard that information is sent between the brain and peripheral nerves via electrical pulses or signals, but I don't understand how they create them in the first place.</p>
","<p>This is quite a big question! I'll try to outline the basic view.</p>

<p>First, let's review how neurons signal between each other. The canonical way for a neuron to send a signal to a downstream neuron is by generating an <strong>action potential</strong>, the ""electrical impulse"" you have heard of. This action potential causes the release of neurotransmitter at a point where the two cells are very close to each other called a <strong>synapse</strong>. The downstream postsynaptic cell receives the neurotransmitter signal and converts it into a small electrical signal. If enough of these small electrical signals happen in a short time, they sum together and are likely to initiate an action potential in the second cell and the cycle repeats all along the circuit.</p>

<p>How is the electrical signal generated? The basics of how this works was worked out most famously by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952. The short story is that the <em>plasma membrane is selectively permeable to ions</em>. Let's build the concept from the ground up.</p>

<h2>The toolbox</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Imagine a sphere of plasma membrane that represents a simple neuron. For starters, we assume that this membrane is bare lipid with no membrane-associated proteins. Because of the hydrophobicity of the bilayer, charged particles cannot diffuse through the membrane. </p></li>
<li><p>The cell is bathed, inside and outside, in a solution containing many <strong>ions</strong> (charged atoms), including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and calcium (Ca2+). As we noted above, these ions cannot go through the membrane without ""help"".</p></li>
<li><p>Now we add an <em>ion pump</em> protein into the membrane which will pump sodium ions out and potassium ions in. This particular pump, the <strong>Na-K ATPase</strong>, creates an excess of sodium ions outside the cell and an excess of potassium ions inside.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we add a potassium <strong>ion channel</strong> to the membrane. This protein creates a pore in the membrane that only allows potassium ions through. This particular protein's pore is always open. Now things start getting exciting...</p></li>
<li><p>What do the potassium ions do now that they can go through the membrane? Ions will move based on the forces created by their <strong>electrochemical gradients</strong>. The pump created a chemical gradient by putting excess K+ inside, so the K+ ions start to flow out through the ion channels. But K+ ions are positively charged, so when they flow out, positive charge starts building up outside and negative charge builds up inside. This electrical gradient opposes the chemical gradient, tending to pull the K+ ions into the cell while the chemical gradients pulls K+ ions out. The influx and efflux reach an equilibrium at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nernst_equation"">Nernst potential</a>, where the electrical and chemical forces equal out. For physiological concentrations of K+ ions, the K+ equilibrium potential is about -80mV or -90mV. This means that K+ ions will flow until the outside of the cell is 80-90mV more positive than the inside of the cell. We started at 0mV, so K+ ions mostly flow out.</p></li>
<li><p>We now have a <strong>membrane potential</strong>, a difference in electrical potential between the inside and the outside of the cell at about -80mV (usually closer to -70mV or -60mV in ""real life""). In particular, this membrane potential is the <em>resting potential</em> that exists when the cell is not active. We can simplify for now and think of the resting potential as being set by a resting permeability of the membrane to potassium ions, but not to sodium ions. We call this membrane polarized, and thus <strong>depolarization</strong> is when the membrane potential becomes more positive, and <strong>hyperpolarization</strong> is when the membrane potential becomes more negative.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, we add to the membrane a <strong>voltage-gated sodium channel</strong>, an ion channel that passes only sodium ions but is usually closed. The voltage-gating means that this ion channel is sensitive to the membrane potential. At the resting potential, the pore is closed and the membrane is still impermeable to sodium ions. When the membrane potential becomes slightly more positive, the channels opens and sodium ions can flow. This channel is also <em>inactivating</em>, so that when it opens it only opens for a short period of time, letting in a limited amount of sodium.</p></li>
<li><p>What way will sodium flow when we open this channel? Because of the negative resting potential (-70mV) and the excess of sodium ions outside due to the pump, both the electrical and chemical gradient will drive sodium ions into the cell. The sodium equilibrium potential is usually around +60mV.</p></li>
<li><p>To complete the machinery for generating an action potential, we also add a <strong>voltage-gated potassium channel</strong> to the membrane. It works just like the voltage-gated sodium channel that is also closed at rest and opens when the membrane potential becomes more positive. This channel opens a bit more slowly than the sodium channel does, but it does not inactivate.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Generating an action potential</h2>

<p>Ok, so how do these parts come together to create an electrical impulse?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The cell sits at its resting membrane potential, with all of its voltage-gated channels closed. It receives a signal from an upstream cell that causes a slight depolarization. The action potential will initiate when the membrane potential hits the <strong>threshold potential</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>At the threshold potential, the voltage-gated sodium channels open letting sodium ions flow into the cell. The sodium flux pulls the membrane from the resting potential (-70mV) towards the sodium equilibrium potential (+60mV). These values are far apart, so the driving force is large and the membrane depolarizes rapidly. This is the action potential <strong>upstroke</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The depolarization also activates the (slightly slower) voltage-gated potassium channels. The potassium ions flow out and drive the depolarized membrane (about +20mV at the action potential peak) back towards the potassium equilibrium potential (-80mV). At the same time, the sodium channels are inactivating so that sodium is no longer depolarizing the membrane. The repolarization rate is usually slower than the depolarization rate. This is the action potential <strong>downstroke</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole process of the action potential depolarization/repolarization cycle takes about 2-3 milliseconds in an ""average"" neuron. Once the cell reaches resting potentials again, the membrane is basically reset. The voltage-gated channels are turned off. The ion pump moves the potassium ions that flowed out and the sodium ions that flowed in. That patch of membrane is ready to fire another action potential!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As a final note, I'll mention that the voltage-gated sodium channel provides a mechanism for the action potential to <strong>propagate</strong> down the axon. The action potential is initiated in one location of the cell, and creates a depolarization. This depolarization causes the voltage-gated sodium channels in neighbouring regions of the membrane to open and generate an action potential cycle of their own. This is how an action potential travel down axons (and sometimes dendrites too).</p>

"Does red light preserve your night vision?","28947","","<p>A number of companies have started marketing LED lamps that can be switched to a red mode. The claim is that red light is less harmful to one's night vision. Given that our eyes are less sensitive to red light, though, I'm not convinced that that red light is any better than dim white light. So if ""equivalent"" luminosity is defined where it's equally easy to, say, read a book in both light types, is there some physiological reason that red light is better than the equivalent white light? </p>
","<p>This is a very good question.  Red light is routinely used by scientific laboratories to do low light dissections of retinas, and of course it is used in other low light contexts such as printing plate development.</p>

<p>In both of the above contexts, you have a clear subject: the retina being dissected or the printing plate being developed.  In the case of the printing plate the film has been designed to be specifically non-reactive to red light, so red light is used because <strong>your eyes can see it, but the film doesn't react to it</strong>.  Similarly in some scientific settings it makes sense to use red light during dissections.  Mice lack a long wavelength opsin, and therefore using a dim red light allows the experimenter to have a <strong>relative sight advantage compared to the mouse</strong> when keeping the mouse dark adapted.</p>

<p>But in the case you're asking about, there is no film or animal to serve as a second party.  So is there any intrinsic advantage to using red light?  As it turns out, there is.  The fovea, which is in the center of our eye and used for high acuity vision, has no rods and primarily L- or red sensitive cones.  Note the high density center area which lacks blue sensitive cones and has <a href=""http://www.psych.ndsu.nodak.edu/mccourt/Psy460/Color%20Vision/Color%20Vision.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">2:1 red to green cones</a>.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wIbcE.jpg"" alt=""retinal mosaic""></p>

<p>So by having red light present, you stimulate this area.  But red light is present in white light, too, why not just use that?  Leonardo's answer comes the closest, but it's a little off.  <strong>Red light is used because it preferentially stimulates L cones more than rods</strong>, but you are definitely not able to preserve night vision by using red light.  Why not?  Well it may look like it is possible to exclusively stimulate cones from the chromatic sensitivity figure </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UvNmc.png"" alt=""chromatic sensitivity""></p>

<p>But that figure is 1) normalized and 2) not indicative of synaptic signal processing.  1000's of rods can converge onto a single ganglion cell, where cone convergence in the fovea can be on the order of a single cone per ganglion cell.  When it comes to perception, in order to compare the black rod line above with the red L-cone line you'd have to magnify it dramatically in size.  Practically speaking, it is nearly impossible to stimulate cone pathways without stimulating rod pathways when using a relatively broad spectrum LED that you're powering with a battery.  Maybe with a high power infrared laser.  </p>

<p>So <strong>the purpose of using red light is to attempt to balance the activation of high sensitivity (red insensitive) rods with that of the low sensitivity (but red sensitive) cones in the fovea.</strong>  While using a similar level of rod activation with blue light, you would perceive a ""blind spot"" where your fovea is.</p>

<p>Finally, instrinsically photosensitive cells (the melanopsin cells brought up) do not factor into this processing.  These cells are activated only with extraordinarily bright levels of light, and the therefore do not enter into conversations dealing with night vision.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.medtech.edu/infographics/blog-medical-terms/images/epistaxis.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.medtech.edu/infographics/blog-medical-terms/images/epistaxis.png</a></p>
","<p>Yes, it can, but it is extremely rare.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... nosebleeds are rarely fatal, accounting for only 4 of the 2.4 million deaths in the U.S. in 1999 [1].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main issue is that epistaxis can be a sign of potentially fatal diseases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The instances in which nosebleed is potentially fatal are those in which there is a history of recent head injury, severe arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease or an underlying vascular tumor in the nasal chambers. Fatal nasal bleeding has not been reported in children [2].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some causes which can lead to fatal complications if left untreated [3]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Leukaemia</li>
  <li>Hypertension</li>
  <li>Coagulation disorders</li>
  <li>Hepatitis</li>
  <li>Head injury</li>
  <li>Myelodysplastic syndromes - Epistaxis</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Death by massive hemorrhage can occur when epistaxis is the result of a ruptured aneurysm [4, 5, 6]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An instance of fatal epistaxis is reported in a patient with an unsuspected aneurysm of the infraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery. There was no known history of trauma. The aneurysm was subsequently detected on an old X-ray film. Epistaxis from an aneurysm at this site is nearly always preceded by significant head trauma and is associated with cranial nerve palsies, a syndrome with a high mortality. Epistaxis from rupture of a non-traumatic aneurysm is very rare [4].</p>

"What nutrients can humans absorb in the mouth?","28396","","<p>For instance, I realise being able to absorb simple sugars in the mouth is pivotal in the rapid action of oral glucose gel. Thus I was wondering what nutrients in general can be absorbed directly within the mouth, and <em>at what speed</em>?</p>
","<p>Quite a bit can be absorbed through the mouth. Most commonly, starches are broken down to maltose (two glucose molecules formed by a condensation reaction) and are easily absorbed by the bloodstream. </p>

<p>A lot of other factors balance into this, ie pH, lipid solubility, and molecular weight. Generally, if a substance is easily dissolved in saliva, it can be administered buccally or sublingually because the only remaining step is the diffusion into the subepithelial capillaries. In regards to speed, anything properly absorbed via buccal or sublingual administration goes to work much faster than a standard oral medication, and with a higher availability in the bloodstream. You are taking first pass metabolism and enzyme breakdown in the stomach out of the equation by diffusing the drug directly into the bloodstream.</p>

<p>There is quite a laundry list of medications that can be administered transbucally or sublingually, just a few of these:
Nitroglycerin
Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)
Glucose gel (as you mentioned)
Fentanyl (a narcotic painkiller)
buprenorphine (for opioid dependency)
Benzodiazepines (alprazolam, clonazepam)</p>

"Pedigree Probability of Autosomal Recessive Trait","28224","","<p>Here is a pedigree: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/566Pu.png"" alt=""Pedigree Chart""></p>

<p>The trait is autosomal recessive.</p>

<p>The question is:  What is the probability that the bottom 2 people (4 and 5) have a child with the trait?</p>

<p>I tried doing <code>2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 *1/4</code> and got <code>2/27</code> but this is wrong. I thought that the probability of III 1 being a carrier is 2/3.  The probability that IV 4 is a carrier is also 2/3.  The probability that III 6 is a carrier is 2/3 and IV 5 must be a carrier.  So IV 4 and IV 5 must be carriers.  The probability that they have a child with the trait is 1/4. But I am not getting the right answer.</p>

<p>The right answer is 1/6.</p>
","<p>Starting with the left hand side of the diagram:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>III:2</em> is definitely a carrier (Tt) as one parent (<em>II:2</em>) is affected (tt).</li>
<li><em>III:1</em> is also definitely a carrier (Tt) as when mating with <em>III:2</em> they produce an affected (tt) offspring (<em>IV:1</em>)</li>
<li>This means that we can work out the possibilities for <em>IV:4</em> as we know the parent genotypes.  It follows the standard arrangement for two carrier parents giving the options of:
<ul>
<li>TT (1/4)</li>
<li>Tt (2/4 = 1/2)</li>
<li>tt (Normally 1/4 but in this case 0 as individual not marked as affected). </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Therefore for this scenario, the probabilities for <em>IV:4</em> are :
<ul>
<li>TT (1/3)</li>
<li>Tt (2/3)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Now if we look at the right hand side of the diagram.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>IV:5</em> is definitely a carrier (Tt) as one of their parents (<em>III:5</em>) is affected.  </li>
</ul>

<p>This gives two possible Punnett squares to be examined:</p>

"Do apes and humans share 99% of DNA or 99% of genes? What is the difference?","28158","","<p>I made an answer on the Scifi.SE that can be read <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/37780/how-did-they-clone-other-breeds-of-dinosaur-other-than-the-one-in-the-blood-of-t/37806#37806"">here</a>. It is about how the characters in the story Jurassic Park might have gotten DNA for all the species shown.</p>

<p>In my answer, I said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apes and Humans, for example, share over 99% of their genes. That means the difference between our species is less than 1% of our genes. In fact, all life on Earth shares about 50% of it's genes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but in the original posting (before someone edited it) I chose to use the word DNA instead of genes.</p>

<p>He left this comment in the section to explain the edit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sorry, I'm a biologist, I can't help it. Humans and apes share 99% similarity in the coding sequences of their DNA, the ~5% that codes for genes, not on all the DNA. I simplified this to genes for the answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a basic high school understanding of DNA and genes, so I'm afraid I fail to see the difference between using ""DNA"" or using ""genes"" in my statement. I understand that genes are specific sequences of DNA that are used by the cell in some way. I understand that DNA is more generic, including all of the strands, whether they are used or not, whether they seem to code for something or not.</p>

<p>So is it wrong then to say that apes and humans share 99% of their DNA or is it equally correct to say ""genes""?</p>
","<p>So, a quick biology lesson, going backwards. <strong>Proteins</strong> are the things that make up a good percentage of our cells (which make up a good percentage of <em>us</em>), and are the things that do the work of the cells - many are also known as ""enzymes"". Proteins are encoded by <strong>genes</strong> - while the saying that one gene codes for one protein is now known to be pretty inaccurate (one gene can code for many different variations of the same basic protein), it's a good way to think about things in this context. Genes are made up of <strong>DNA</strong>, the ""genetic code"" that we hear about - the 4 billion (-ish) ""letters"" that make us who we are. However, now we get to the key part - <em>all genes are made of DNA, but not all DNA is in a gene</em>. In fact, as terdon mentioned in your comment, only about 5% (or less) of those 4 billion letters are in the expressed region of genes - those sequences that directly code for protein. The rest is regulatory, structural, and ... we're not exactly sure. Some call it ""junk DNA"", but it's stuck around for millions of years, so it must have some purpose, we just haven't figured it out yet. There are a lot of divergent sequences in this ""non-coding"" DNA between species, so it must somehow contribute to the differences between us, but how exactly that happens hasn't been elucidated yet. </p>

"What's the smallest size a human eye can see?","27471","","<p>During a biology experiment at school, where we would look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elodea"">waterweeds</a> under a microscope, my teacher said something about that it's impossible for the human eye to see the cells without a magnifying glass of some sort. So, I saw that as a challenge, and decided to check if I could see the cells. And after holding the leaves really close to my face, I was indeed able to see tiny rectangles.</p>

<p>Since I was curious about it now, I decided to look some more things up. First, I tried to find out the actual size of waterweed cells. Based on <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waterpest_celstructuur.jpg"">this 640x enlarged image</a>, which features cells of 5mm wide and 10 - 15mm long in the picture (which corresponds with of roughly 8µm wide and 15µm long).</p>

<p>I left this in the back of my head for a long time then, but I just looked at my cotton sleeve, and noticed tiny fibers. Not the ones that are woven together, but ones that are standing out from it. So, after looking it up, it turns out that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_micrometres"">cotton fibers are 10 µm wide</a>.</p>

<p>So, I wondered, <strong>what is the smallest size a human eye can actually see</strong>? According to a whole bunch of sources all across the internet, it's either <a href=""http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/how-small-can-naked-eye-see"">200-400µm</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htPXMQ5s-yo#t=26"">100µm</a>, or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye#Small_objects_and_maps"">58-75µm</a>. I also hear 'the width of a human hair' very often, but those can range <a href=""http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml"">from 17 to 181µm</a>.</p>
","<p>Very nice question!</p>

<p>First of all, the 'smallest size' that a human eye can perceive is called <strong>visual acuity</strong>, and can be expressed in various ways. It cannot simply be expressed by means of size measures, as objects with a fixed size are perceived as smaller when viewed from a distance (<em>perspective</em>). A familiar example is the train track:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KKV3V.jpg"" alt=""perspective""> </p>

<p>Hence, visual acuity has to be measured as a function of viewing distance, i.e,  in degrees of visual view. Measured in degrees, the visual acuity of the average normally sighted person is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>60</sub> degree, or 1 minute of arc (1 MAR) (<a href=""http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-viii-gabac-receptors/visual-acuity/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Webvision, chapter ""Visual Acuity"", by Kalloniatis &amp; Luu</a>). </p>

<p>Using the basic structure of the eye and some trigonometry one can deduce the smallest visible size :</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H0yS8.jpg"" alt=""basic structure of the eye""></p>

<p>The trigonometric formula becomes: $2d \times tan(\frac{\alpha}{2})$ with <em>d</em> being the viewing distance and alpha ($\alpha$) the visual acuity expressed in radians ($\pi \times \frac{degrees}{180}$) (<a href=""https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/PenetrantTest/Introduction/visualacuity.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">NDT resource center</a>).  </p>

<p>Assuming the closest distance an adult can focus (~100 mm) and an average maximal acuity of 1 MAR, the smallest visible size boils down to <strong>29 microns</strong>. </p>

<p>A young child can focus at distances down to ~50 mm, and can have a visual acuity of 0.4 MAR, which yields <strong>6 microns</strong>. </p>

<p>Note that 1 MAR encompasses 288 microns on the retina, and some 180 photoreceptors. The optical limitations of the eye (such as diffraction by the lens and light scatter by the neural cells in the retina) limits the resolution of the human eye below the theoretical 'pixel limit' of the eye.</p>

<p>So to sum up, depending on one's age, one should be able to see targets in the order of 6 - 29 microns. The lower bounds of this range are indeed in the range of the waterweed cells and cloth fibers you describe. </p>

<p>PS - the values described are representative under ideal conditions, i.e., under situations of abundant lighting and high contrast.</p>

"Will the heart keep beating if it's separated from the body?","27228","","<p>The heart is a vital organ in our body, as it drives blood circulation. I was wondering if a heart keeps beating if it is separated from the body? If yes, then why?</p>
","<p><strong>Short version</strong>
The heart  has the ability to beat independently of the brain as long as it has oxygen. The heart will eventually stop beating as all bodily systems begin to stop working shortly after brain death. Remember the heart can beat, but your diaphragm and lungs wont. hence the cardiac muscles undergo asphyxiation and die off. However, immediately after death, there is enough oxygenated blood in the body to keep thing moving for a while</p>

<p><strong>Long version</strong>
There is a simple explanation why.</p>

<p>As you know every muscle in the body has to receive stimuli from the neuromuscular junctions (and subsequently the nervous system) in order to contract. </p>

<p>The heart is a bit different in that it is not regulated by the brain, but the regulatory mechanisms lie within the heart itself. The heart conductive system contains a special group of cells called the pace maker cells (SA node) that fire at regular intervals and cause the heart to beat.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KIWFf.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each heart beat is triggered by an electrical pacemaker - a group of cells in the heart that have the ability to generate electrical activity. They cause electrical impulses to spread over the heart and make it contract.
  The largest natural pacemaker of the heart is called the sinoatrial or SA node and is found in the right atrium. From it, specialised groups of cells that carry the electrical charge lead off to the rest of the heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Taken from <a href=""http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/hearthealth/howtheheartworks.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>)</p>

<p>The brain regulates the rate of the heart beat sure, but it does not send the signals that cause the heart to beat in itself.</p>

<p>In short, even after disconnection, the SA node still sends the impulse down the AV node and purkinje fibres that spread out across the cardiac musculature and cause them to contract, causing the heart to beat. This will continue for a while till they run out of energy and stop.</p>

"Why is defibrillation in asystole (""flat line"") useless?","27218","","<p>In most popular medical dramas, when a patient has a cardiac arrest and ""flatlines"" the doctors many times use a defibrillator to ""shock the heart back into rhythm'. I know that actually, the proper protocol is CPR and epinephrine (if possible), and that you should shock rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation. But why doesn't shocking the heart in asystole help?  </p>

<p>If anyone could please explain, that'd be great.</p>
","<p>In layman's terms: an Asystole is not affected by the electric shocks of a defibrillator. A defibrillator is used when the heart goes in fibrillations because it actually CAUSES an asystole. The idea is that you basically reset the heart to a blank state so you can start normal CPR procedure to help the heart go back to a normal rythm. That's why you see them applying CPR between shocks.</p>

"How are the paranasal sinuses linked with the capillaries in the ear canals?","27206","","<p>Sinus congestion often seems to be accompanied by excess pressure on the outer ears (as anyone who has shared a transcontinental flight with an infant can attest to) or fluid buildup in the canals.  An increase the capillary pressure within the ear canals would explain the pressure, but what is the physiological connection between the sinus pressure and pressure in the ears?</p>

<p>The most obvious answer I can think of is that any direct drainage from the sinuses would cause a backup of fluid into the Eustachian tubes.  This would only explain pressure coming from the other side of the eardrum, but is such pressure simply relieved by blood pressure transfer to the capillaries in the ear canal, or is there a non-trivial mechanism by, e.g., a vagal circuit which governs the relationship between the sinuses and the outer ear? </p>
","<p>There is no direct link between the capillaries in the sinuses and the ear.</p>

<p>The Eustachian tubes drain the middle ear (between the eardrum and the inner ear) into the nasopharynx, the part of the throat that is just behind the nose.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VlH7m.jpg"" alt=""Eustachian tubes and middle ear via American Flyers""></p>

<p>The para-nasal sinuses drain into the nasal passages themselves at different points. The sinuses and middle ear constantly produce some fluid, which is either reabsorbed or drained.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6yyr.jpg"" alt=""Paranasal Sinuses via Harvard Women&#39;s Health Watch""></p>

<p>Often what happens is that in the case of a common cold or other upper respiratory tract infection, the nasopharynx and nasal mucosa are both infected. The inflammation causes swelling and blocks off the Eustachian tubes and the drainage pathways of the sinuses and the trapped fluid itself causes sinus &amp; ear pain and can get infected causing sinusitis and otitis media. Alternatively a viral infection can also go up into the middle ear and sinuses causing direct infection.</p>

<p>The process that occurs when you go on a plane is slightly different. The Eustachian tubes and sinus openings collapse due to pressure and thus the natural fluid that is produced accumulates as well as there being an inability to neutralise the internal and external pressure (thus why making your ears 'pop' works- you force the Eustachian tubes open via positive pressure)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SouAk.gif"" alt=""Blocked Eustachian tube via Merck Manual""></p>

<p>Regarding blood supply of the paranasal sinuses and the ear:</p>

<p>The ear is supplied by the posterior auricular and superficial temporal arteries of the external carotid artery.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IJi09.png"" alt=""Branches of the external carotid artery via Medical Mnemonics""></p>

Is there any advantage at all to one group or the other?  <a href=""http://rajugurusamy.wordpress.com/2007/10/06/why-blood-types-and-any-advantage/"">This article</a> hints that there are some pathogens that display a preference to a blood type (for example <a href=""http://Schistosomiasis"">Schistosomiasis</a> <em>apparently</em> being more common in people with blood group A, although it could be that more people have type A in the areas that the parasite inhabits).  Is there any literature out there to support or refute this claim or provide similar examples?  </p>

<p>Beyond ABO-Rh, is there any advantage or disadvantage (excluding the obvious difficulties in finding a donor after accident/trauma) in the 30 other blood type suffixes recognised by the International Society of Blood Transfusions (<a href=""http://www.isbtweb.org/home/"">ISBT</a>)?  </p>

<p>I'd imagine not (or at least very minimal) but it would be interesting to find out if anyone knows more. </p>

<p><strong>Cholera Infection Susceptibility &amp; Severity</strong>.

<p><em><strong>E. coli</em> Infection Susceptibility &amp; Severity.</strong> A study in Scotland indicated that those with the O blood group showed higher than expected infection rates with <em>E. coli O157</em> and significantly higher fatality rates (78.5% of fatalities had blood group O).<sup><a href=""http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/185/3/393.abstract?ijkey=b285b74e38278f7c2423ce7a06e3555cf08f1d85&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"">(4)</a></sup></p>

<p>Whether blood group antigens are displayed on other body cells or not has been linked to increased or decreased susceptibility to many diseases, notably norrovirus and HIV.

"Why was the Davson-Danielli model rejected?","26771","","<p>According to my textbook, Davson-Danielli's model of a phospholipid bilayer sandwiched between two layers of globular protein was incorrect. The nonpolar protein portions would separate the polar portions of the phospholipids from water, causing the bilayer to dissolve. Meaning, the Davson-Danielli model is not only incorrect, but it is also impossible.</p>

<p>I understand why the model is incorrect, but not why it is impossible. In my view, the nonpolar proteins would remain together in a micelle shape due to hydrophobic exclusion. Because of this, the phospholipid bilayer sandwiched on the inside would remain isolated from the water.</p>

<p>Why would a bilayer dissolve if the proteins were in contact with water and the phospholipids were isolated from the water? </p>

<p>I think that my confusion stems from many misunderstandings about the chemistry and structure of the cell membrane. In depth illustration of the error that my book mentioned would be most helpful.</p>

<li>Membranes have distinct inside and outside layers (defined by the
membrane proteins which are present on the surface of the membrane)</li>
<li>Other than predicted by the model, the membrane proteins do not have
a very good solubility in water - in fact they are amphiphatic,
meaning they have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. The
hydrophobic side is anchored inside the membrane.</li>
<li>When the membrane proteins would cover the lipid bilayer, their
hydrophobic regions would be in contact with water, which
destabilizes this construct. Even if they would be oriented towards
the membrane, they would face towards the hydrophilic heads of the
phospholipids causing the same effect. Additionally the proteins
would also seperate the hydrophilic phospholipid heads from the
water. So there is no real stable solution in embedding the membrane

<p>Am I missing anything? I've heard that population shifts within a existing populaces will effect evolution, but imagining the most simplicity scenario, it's hard to see why the would make a difference. </p>
","<p>Evolution is defined as a change in the allele frequency of population through time.  The Hardy-Weinberg model predicts that the allele frequency of a population will not change (i.e., evolution will not occur) if the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>no natural or sexual selection</p></li>
<li><p>no gene flow (immigration or emigration from the population)</p></li>
<li><p>no mutatation</p></li>

<p><strong>EDIT based on comments from Remi.b:</strong> Non-random mating alone is not sufficient to cause evolution if the other conditions exist. </p>

"Why are turtles classified as reptiles and not amphibians?","26588","","<p>I understand that turtles are reptiles because like all reptiles, they have scales on their body. But turtles (specifically sea turtles) live on both land and water, very much like amphibians. Also, don't sea turtles have more of a moist skin unlike reptiles? So is there any anatomical difference which makes turtles different from amphibians?</p>
","<p>Amphibians are not defined for having a moist skin, neither are reptiles defined for having scales on their body.</p>

<p>In biology, organisms (elements) are grouped according to their evolutive history in <strong>monophyletic</strong> groups, also known as <strong>clades</strong>. Basicaly, a monophyletic group is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A group consisting of an ancestral and all its descendants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""Tetrapoda"" is a monophyletic group, formed by vertebrates with four limbs. Inside Tetrapoda, there are two groups: ""Amphibia"" and ""Amniota"". Amphibians are non-amniotes tetrapods, and we have some doubt if they are a monophyletic group. Amniotes, on the other hand, are tetrapods having an amniotic egg, including you and me, and they form a monophyletic group.</p>

<p>The amniotes are divided in two monophyletic group: ""Mammals"", which are amniotes with a synapsid skull, and ""Reptiles"", which are amniotes with diapsid skulls (I'm using ""reptiles"" as synonym of Sauropsida).</p>

<p>Reptiles include turtles, lizards, snakes, alligators and dinosaurs (which include the birds: all birds are dinosaurs). It doesn't matter if a animal has or has not scales, or if it lays eggs or if it is viviparous, or if it has 5 fingers or 3 fingers: <strong>All</strong> the descendants of a given ancestor are included in the monophyletic group that contains that ancestor. </p>

<p>Turtles, despite being strange or somehow different, are descendants from the same <em>most recent commom ancestor</em> of Reptilia... that's why turtles are reptiles (and that's why birds are reptiles as well).</p>

<p>To make this more clear, have a look at this cladogram (from Hickman, Integrated Principles of Zoology):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/utxNx.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/utxNx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The apomorphy that defines the tetrapods is ""paired limbs"". You have Amphibia to the left and Amniota to the right, whose apomorphy is "" egg with extraembrionic membranes"". Inside them, you have Reptilia, whose apomorphies are ""skull with upper and lower fenestra and beta-keratin in epidermis"". Turtles came from an ancestor with these characteristics. So, turtles belong to the monophyletic group of ""Reptiles"".</p>

<p><em>Post scriptum</em>: You wrote that ""turtles (specifically sea turtles) live on both land and water, very much like amphibians"". Just a curiosity: the reason why sea turtles leave the water (sea) from time to time shows exactly that <strong>they are not amphibians!</strong> Amphibians, being non-amniotes, have eggs that survive under water (actually, with few exceptions, they need to be under water). Turtles, on the other hand, are amniotes, and the amniotic egg cannot be laid under water. That's why the turtles have to leave the water to lay eggs: because, contrary to the amphibians, they cannot lay eggs under water.</p>

"What is the difference between a graded potential and an action potential?","26366","","<p>I was under the impression the only signals neurons send using changes in membrane potential are action potentials. But my biology professor showed us diagrams of graded potentials and action potentials and to me they looked very similar.  </p>

<p>What is the difference between a graded potential and an action potential?  </p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
An action potential is a binary all-or-nothing event, while a graded potential is an analog signal.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Action potentials, once initiated, are basically all-or-nothing events. Amplitudes may admittedly be variable, but basically it is the spike rate that is relevant to the neural code <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/94/24/12740.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Gerstner <em>et al</em>., 1997)</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast, graded potentials code information mainly by <em>amplitude</em>. A notable example of the significance of graded potentials is the function of the inner hair cells in the cochlea (the inner ear). The mechanoreceptors on the hair cells open when deflected in one direction, while they close in the other. This is important, as that property depolarizes the cell on one phase of an input sinusoid, while it hyperpolarizes the cell in the subsequent phase. Also, stronger (louder) input increases the response, while softer stimulu generate less response (Fig. 1). In the auditory nerve this graded potential is translated into spike rates (Fig. 2). Basically the hair-cell and auditory nerve system is an analogue-to-digital converter.</p>

","<p>There is a distinct difference between the 'genes' that we share, and the genome (the DNA) that the genes are made of.</p>

<p>All humans (excluding genetic disorders) have the same genes, but not everyone has exactly the same code - there are tiny differences between individuals, and these are manifested in the different traits you can observe between people (eye colour, height, etc).</p>

<p>So you therefore have 100% of the genes that your mother has.</p>

<p>However, as stated in the first answer, you inherit the different 'alleles', or versions, of the genes from your parents, and end up with ~50% of the alleles from each parents (but all the genes).</p>

<p>With regard to species differences; many of the genes we inherit have evolved over millions (in fact billions) of years, and thus many of our genes are present in most other organisms (but in very different forms - the DNA). Chimpanzees are our closest relatives in evolutionary terms, and thus their genes are very similar to ours in the genome (~98% the same). But this only applies to the coding regions! Less than 2% of your genome actually codes for genes - the rest is mostly regulatory (not junk, as it used to be called), and this is where the true inter-species variation lies. So whilst we have ~98% homology in the protein-coding regions, this is MUCH less if you count the whole genome.</p>

The lowest layer is separated from the dermis by the basal membrane (a.k.a. basal lamina, basement membrane).</p>

There is a lot of detail on Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing</a>.</p>

<p>If the basement membrane is not disrupted, there are two main components as a rule of thumb: 1) outwards-inwards migration, i.e. cells surrounding a wound will migrate into the wound. 2) bottom-upwards differentiation, i.e. the bottom-most layer contains replicating cells which will differentiate and squamify to regenerate upper layers.</p>

<p>Something like this (picture modified from Wikipedia): <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xvd2W.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If the wound is bleeding, this means the basement membrane is disrupted and the dermis underneath is also wounded (the epidermis itself contains no blood vessels). In this case, the dermis needs to regenerate first, in a process which is probably similar as described above. Simultaneously, the bottom-most epidermal cell layer will proliferate to close the gap, and then deposit new basement membrane. Remember that the basement membrane is a mesh of proteins, not an actual cell layer.</p>

<p>Transcription - RNA polymerase 
Translation - aminoacyl tRNA synthetase </p>

<p>I know that the ribosome almost runs translation, but I don't think ribosomes are enzymes, which is why I went with aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.  Is this right? </p>
","<p>Sorry, but you started on the right track. What you're looking for is called the central dogma of protein synthesis.</p>

<p>Genomic DNA is transcribed in the nucleus into messenger RNA (mRNA) by RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase is DNA-dependent; it needs a DNA template to make an RNA version of the message.</p>

<p>The messenger RNA moves into the cytoplasm where it gets translated by ribosomes into an a polypeptide (protein). Ribosomes are the enzyme that do the translating, and perhaps your confusion is because ribosomes are made up of both RNA molecules and proteins (a ribonucleotide complex).</p>

<p>Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases are the enzymes that make aminoacyl tRNAs (tRNA for short). These tRNA bring individual amino acids to the ribosome as the ribosome is extending the polypetide product of the mRNA message.</p>

<p>Obviously the size of the standard deviation would vary across countries and by other factors.  That said, I think good data on a few representative countries would be sufficient to get a reasonable sense of what it typically is and the extent to which the standard deviation varies.</p>
","<p>It's probably around 7 cm for men and 6 cm for women.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.econ.upf.edu/docs/papers/downloads/1002.pdf"">The Evolution of Adult Height in Europe</a>, which is a source for some of the statistics reported on that Wikipedia page, gives averages, standard deviations, and sample sizes for both sexes across 10 european countries (and across a number of different age cohorts).</p>

"How do archaea relate to eukaryotes and bacteria?","23979","","<p>I've read that they all share some genes, internal structure, and behaviour with each other, but with different degrees of overlap depending of what the function is. E.g., archaea have some eukaryotic and some bacterial function, and eukaryotes have bacterial function in the form of mitochondria and plastids.</p>

<p>However I'm finding the nitty-gritty of all this rather confusing. Could anyone please explain some of the detail for me as I can't seem to make any sense of this from reading Wikipedia, etc.</p>
","<p>The relationship between the three is so overly complicated because of horizontal gene transfer, i.e. cells sharing parts of their genome with others instead of the normal passing-down to the next generation. This works between eukaryotes, archaea and bacteria and causes the mixing of the three.</p>

<p>An overview (originally proposed by <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/87/12/4576.long"" rel=""nofollow"">Woese <em>et al</em></a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Bacteria are simplest considering cellular organisation. They have no nucleus or other internal membranes and no cytoskeleton. Their DNA is generally ""junk-free""* (i.e. no introns), not bound by histones (""organising"" proteins) and the organisation of regulatory sequences is relatively straightforward, typically with one 'operator' sequence before a gene.</li>
<li>Eukaryotes are complex cells in comparison. They have a nucleus and are full of internal membranes (ER, golgi, vesicles,...). Their complex cytoskeleton allows them to grow very large in comparison. Their DNA is usually full of more or less ""junk""*, organised into tight bundles by histones and they tend to have a ridiculous amount of regulatory sequences way before, just at the start and even <em>inside</em> genes. Very importantly, they possess endosymbionts as you mentioned - mitochondria or plasmids, derived probably from some protobacterium.</li>
<li>Archaea at first appear to be a mixture between the two. A nice way to sum it up (though not very accurate) is ""eukaryote in a bacterium's clothing"". Their cells look a lot like prokaryotes because they are similar size, have no nucleus, endomembranes or cytoskeleton. However, some archaeas' DNA <em>is</em> bound by histones and they use similar machinery as eukaryotes for DNA replication, transcription and translation.</li>
</ul>

<p>One possible explanation for this (theory by <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Five-Kingdoms-Illustrated-Guide-Phyla/dp/0716730278"" rel=""nofollow"">Margulis &amp; Schwartz</a> as explained by my tutor) is: From the last universal common ancestor, first prokaryotes and archaea diverged. After this branching, the differences in genetic machinery evolved. Archaea then branched, producing a protoeukaryote line which went on to endosymbiosis with some protobacteria. That would explain the similarities I outlined above: similar cell structure between archaea and prokaryotes but similar genetic machinery between archaea and eukaryotes.</p>

<p>It gets a bit more complicated though, because archaea and bacteria can exchange genetic material, and eukaryotes incorporated a lot of their endosymbionts' DNA in their own genome, so you end up with all of them having a huge mix of genes from the others.</p>

<p>Edit: Genetic machinery refers to the enzymes used for DNA replication and transcription (DNA and RNA polymerase and the transcription initiation factors) and translation (ribosomes and several other translation factors involved). For example: Prokaryotes only have one type of RNA polymerase which uses sigma factor to bind the initiaion site. Eukaryotes and archaea both have three types of RNA polymerase which use TATA-binding protein for initiation. Or: In Prokaryotes, the translation start codon codes for formyl-methionine while in eukaryotes and archaea it codes for ""normal"" methionine. (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674%2800%2980284-6"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a>)</p>

<p>*) Unrelated to your question, but in my own defence: I am aware that the usage of the word ""junk"" is somewhat unaccepted nowadays, because it supposes that there is ""useful"" and ""unuseful"" genetic material. Also, some of what was thought to be junk has been identified to have regulatory function etc. However, it's also a fact that a lot has been identified to have no function to the cell whatsoever, most of it parasitic DNA which is dead or still happily replicating away (LINEs and SINEs). That is, ""junk"" to the cell.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don't have to see a CT scan or autopsy to know if the brainstem is
  injured (directly or indirectly), if it doesn't work right. </p>
  
  <p>The description of the first doc at the scene mentioned that Lincoln
  was not breathing, and one pupil was dilated (the latter a clear and
  unequivocal sign of dysfunction of the third cranial nerve or the
  upper brainstem, from where it comes). Unfortunately, the second doc
  described the enlarged pupil being the right one (it's extremely
  unlikely to have been one and then the other - one of the doc's was
  probably mistaken as to the side). </p>
  
  <p>By 3 hours after injury, both pupils were fixed and dilated, and
  <strong>Lincoln showed extensor (decerebrate) posturing</strong> - again, all signs of
  profound brainstem dysfunction (but not yet brain death, though pretty
  close to it).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Decerebrate posturing is also called decerebrate response, decerebrate
  rigidity, or extensor posturing. It describes the involuntary
  extension of the upper extremities in response to external stimuli. In
  decerebrate posturing, the head is arched back, the arms are extended
  by the sides, and the legs are extended.[6] A hallmark of decerebrate
  posturing is extended elbows.[12] The arms and legs are extended and
  rotated internally.[13] The patient is rigid, with the teeth
  clenched.[13] The signs can be on just one or the other side of the
  body or on both sides, and it may be just in the arms and may be
  intermittent.[13] </p>
  
  <p>A person displaying decerebrate posturing in
  response to pain gets a score of two in the motor section of the
  Glasgow Coma Scale (for adults) and the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale
  (for infants). Decerebrate posturing indicates brain stem damage,
  specifically damage below the level of the red nucleus (e.g.
  mid-collicular lesion). It is exhibited by people with lesions or
  compression in the midbrain and lesions in the cerebellum</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>The decerebrate posturing is a sign of major brainstem dysfunction.</p>

<p><strong>The reversibility</strong> of this state (which is considered to be very critical and hardly reversible) <strong>depends upon the origin of the brainstem dysfunction</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The primary brainstem</strong> dysfunction means that the brainstem was directly damaged (by a bullet) and there <strong>is no way</strong> that this can be quickly <strong>reversed</strong>. This is exactly the case here and there are no chances that the brainstem might recooperate with time.</p>

<p><strong>The secondary brainstem</strong> dysfunction may be caused by cerebral edema and thereby dislocation of the brainstem towards <em>foramen magnum</em>, where the brainstem is coned. The coning of the brainstem <strong>can be reversible</strong> if the brain edema is treated quickly and effectively (by administration of diuretics in the intravenal catheter. </p>

<p>With brainstem regaining its normal functions the decerebral posture will eventuall resolve and depending upon the residual brain injury the recooperation of the brain function (and compensation) may be almost entire.</p>

"Why can cats interpret things on a monitor/tv, but dogs cannot?","23921","","<p>E.g. you can see a lot of videos where cats are smashing some mouse or spider on an ipad, but I have never seen it with a dog. I have a dog myself and I know that he sometimes responds to the sounds from the TV, but not to the images.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>
","<p><strong>Cats and dogs can both view tv screens &amp; monitors</strong> ... though their viewing experience is a little different to ours thanks to differences in cone structure leaving them <a href=""http://i.stuff.co.nz/life-style/blogs/four-legs-good/2604288/What-your-pets-really-see-on-TV"">color blind and giving low acuity</a>. </p>

<p>Both species have lower levels of color vision than humans. Cats see slightly more color <a href=""http://i.stuff.co.nz/life-style/blogs/four-legs-good/2604288/What-your-pets-really-see-on-TV"">(in the blue green and yellow end of the spectrum)</a> than dogs do so they may get more of an immersive experience from watching TV. </p>

<p>Further, cats and dogs need a higher frame rate than humans to make it appear as a smooth film, a phenomenon known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold"">flicker fusion</a>, in humans <a href=""http://sciencenordic.com/do-dogs-see-what%E2%80%99s-happening-tv"">we require 15-20 frames per second, dogs require 70fps</a> and <a href=""http://i.stuff.co.nz/life-style/blogs/four-legs-good/2604288/What-your-pets-really-see-on-TV"">cats about 100</a>. Before the frame rate of televisions increased in recent years it would appeared to them to be flashing images, similar to when you <a href=""http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question336.htm"">point a digital camera at a screen</a> which may explain why the dog is not interested in the TV, it'd be like staring at a strobe for hours on end. Here is <a href=""http://www.daisypeel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dog-vision-miller-murphy.pdf"">a paper which discusses flicker rates and color vision in dogs</a>.</p>

<p>To summarize there are several factors which influence the ""enjoyment"" an animal can take from watching a TV - <strong>their response to TV imagery will depend on the frames per second, colors, contrast, clarity, movement, subject matter, and (perhaps most importantly in my opinion) the temperament of the animal, for all of which there are difference between the species.</strong></p>

<p>From sciencenordic.com:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""We humans need about 16 to 20 images a second to perceive what we see
  as continuous film, whereas dogs need about 70 images per second.</p>
  
  <p>So a few years ago, Fido was probably confounded by his master's
  behaviour of sitting for hours staring at a flashing succession of
  images. With modern resolution and quicker imaging, dogs have become
  potential television viewers.</p>
  
  <p>This has not gone unrecognised in the USA, for example, where hopeful
  TV producers have started special TV channels for dogs.</p>
  
  <p>If you have other pets, however, you need to think twice before
  placing them in front of the TV.</p>
  
  <p>Birds need at least 100 frames per second to see TV images as a moving
  picture. Having a bird in the same room as a TV with a lower frame
  rate than that will be very stressful for the creature.""</p>

"What's the difference between shotgun sequencing and clone based sequencing?","23907","","<p>In a lecture during  my undergraduate degree we were introduced to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1084159/"" rel=""nofollow"">the race to complete the human genome</a>. Celera were competing with Sanger and collaborators to sequence the human genome. Celera wanted to patent some sequences, whilst Sanger <em>et al.</em> wanted to keep their findings in the public domain. Celera knew they couldn't compete with Sanger <em>et al.</em> with conventional cloning techniques which required a lot of man-power, <em>""so instead opted for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_sequencing"" rel=""nofollow"">shotgun sequencing</a>""</em>. </p>

<p>To me it seems like both clone based sequencing and shotgun sequencing could have been used together, however the lecturers semantics were a bit vague (<em>...okay, I wasn't paying close enough attention!</em>) and I didn't ask for clarification at the time.</p>

<p>Whilst I appreciate this is a large topic, what are the main differences between Celera's shotgun sequencing and Sanger's clone based sequencing during the late 1990s? Are ""shotgun cloning"" and ""clone based sequencing"" actually mutually exclusive terms?</p>
","<p>The v short answer is that in shotgun sequencing, the sequencer is fed a set of random sequences from the target.  This can be done for instance by mechanically shearing DNA and then building a set of shotgun sequencing jobs which are then compiled back together by a genome assembler (i.e. in whole genome sequencing projects) into a full sequence.  </p>

<p>In clone based sequencing, the DNA to be sequenced is specifically sectioned off into sequence copied into of plasmids (BACs - bacterial artificial chromosome) to divide the sequencing job into sections- a divide and conquer strategy.  BACs can be 150 kb long just to give you an idea. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.learner.org/courses/biology/textbook/genom/genom_2.html"">These are not mutually exclusive terms</a>; clone-based sequencing projects usually use the large clone libraries to section the project into a set of shotgun sequencing projects. </p>

<p>In case the difference exists, would it be correct to say that inoculation is purposefully infecting a person with a pathogen in a controlled way, even when the person is already infected, to induce immunity while vaccination is administering dead or weakened pathogens to a healthy person as a preventive measure to check future infections?</p>

<p>Also, would it be correct to say that vaccination is an advanced form of inoculation? </p>
","<p>Both are forms of immunisation. </p>

<p>Inoculation is exactly that. A live organism is introduced in a controlled way, so as to minimise the risk of infection, and is essentially the same process followed by many people in history.  It is inherently risky.</p>

<p>Vaccination is introducing a weakened version of the pathogen, so that the immune response is triggered and the body is prepared to fight the actual pathogen if necessary.

<p>I've also heard anecdotes claiming that pepper spray, if applied with sufficient intensity, can cause death.</p>

<p>What if you were to eat as many spicy peppers as possible, despite the noxious taste? Is it possible to commit suicide in this way (and what would the cause of death)? Would you faint from excessive mouth pain? Would uncontrollable vomiting prevent you from consuming further peppers?</p>
","<p>The more ""dangerous"" properties of spicy peppers are chiefly due to capsaicin.</p>

<p>Sigma-Aldrich sells <a href=""http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/m2028?lang=en&amp;region=US"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">purified capsaicin</a>, for which they provide safety information, including an MSDS. Most of it is the usual, unsurprising set of warnings about irritation to eyes and the respiratory system. However, there are LD50 numbers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LD50 Oral - rat - male - 161.2 mg/kg</p>
  
  <p>LD50 Oral - rat - female - 148.1 mg/kg</p>
  
  <p>LD50 Dermal - mouse - >512 mg/kg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this, we can conclude that one would have to eat quite a bit of capsaicin to die. If lethality in humans is exactly the same as rat (which it probably isn't),  a 70 kg human would need to consume about 11 g of capsaicin to reach similar levels of lethality.</p>

<p>The Carolina Reaper, one of the hottest known peppers, averages about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Reaper"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1.6 million</a> on the Scoville scale. Capsaicin amount is related to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale#High-performance_liquid_chromatography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scoville heat units</a>, so we can make an imprecise conversion from one to the other.</p>

<p>Using values given in 2 publications (<a href=""http://www.sciencepub.net/newyork/ny0309/03_3176ny0309_17_21.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nwokem 2010</a> and <a href=""http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/16/10/8919"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Al Othman 2011</a>) we can observe the following trend:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jaTOQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So on average, about $6.25 \cdot 10^{-5}$ mg/g capsaicin per SHU. With this, we get $(1.6 \cdot 10^5) \cdot (6.25 \cdot 10^{-5}) = 10$ mg/g, or 1% capsaicin for dry Carolina Reapers. To eat the equivalent of 11 g of capsaicin in peppers, you would have to eat 1.1 kg of dry peppers - which should be a couple of dozen.</p>

<p>So, I think we can conclude that it is relatively ""feasible"" to consume a dangerously large amount of capsaicin by eating very spicy peppers. However, there are numerous caveats with my reasoning:</p>

<ul>
<li>Human LD50 and rat LD50 are not necessarily the same.</li>
<li>Toxicity is not necessarily linearly related to body weight.</li>
<li>Peppers have compounds besides capsaicin that contribute to hotness.</li>
<li>It would be very difficult to eat such a large amount of spicy peppers, and various involuntary reflexes would interfere. Even if one were force fed the peppers, I imagine the body would attempt to vomit it up - which brings up the question of how the toxicologists even managed to feed several milligrams of capsaicin to rats to measure the LD50.</li>

<p><em>Note: I know this question can potentially bring disrespectful answers/comments, but I'm hopeful that this site and its members can answer this interesting question. Otherwise, I'll simply erase my question.</em></p>
","<p>It's an interesting question and one that has been asked before. NPR did a <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2013/11/01/241895965/how-one-kenyan-tribe-produces-the-worlds-best-runners"">story</a> in 2013 on this topic, but their question was a bit more focused than just ""why are so many black people good runners?"" </p>

<p>The observation that led to their story wasn't just that black people in general were over-represented among long-distance running medalists, but that Kenyans in particular were over-represented. Digging deeper, the story's investigators found that the best runners in Kenya also tended to come from the same tribal group: the Kalenjin. </p>

<p>I'm not going to repeat all the details in that story (which I encourage you to read), but the working answer that the investigators came up with is that there are both genetic traits and certain cultural practices that contribute to this tribe's success on the track. Unfortunately, from the point of view of someone who wants a concise answer, it is very difficult to separate and quantify the exact contributions that each genetic and cultural modification makes to the runners' successes. </p>

<p>Pubmed also has a number of peer-reviewed papers detailing the Kalenjin running phenomenon, but I could only find <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=kalenjin%20running"">two</a> with free full-access and neither had the promising title of ""Analysis of the Kenyan distance-running phenomenon,"" for which you have to pay. Insert annoyed frowning face here.</p>

<p>I did a quick search of some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliud_Kipchoge"">Kenyan</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Cheruiyot"">gold</a> medalist runners in the 2016 Olympics and sure enough, several (though certainly not all) are Kalenjin. I'm less sure about the Ethiopian runners, since most research that I found online seems to focus on the Kenyans, but I'd feel safe hypothesizing that something similar can explain their dominance at the podium. </p>

<p>So, the short answer to your question is that it's not just ""black people"" who dominate the world of competitive long-distance running, but that very specific subsets of people (who, as it turns out, are black) do display a competitive advantage and that both genetics and culture account for much of this advantage. </p>

"Do Penicillin based antibiotics affect birth control?","23559","","<p>I wasn't sure whether to ask this question on Biology or Chemistry Stack Exchange, since it is really biochemisty, but this is something that's been puzzling me.</p>

<p>Most pharmacists (all that I've encountered) tell you that antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of birth control. There are side-effect warnings on all Penicillin based antibiotics that say they decrease the effectiveness of birth control, and advise you to use a back-up method when taking antibiotics.</p>

<p>However, most health organization websites (Planned Parenthood, Mayo Clinic, NHS) explicitly state that ONLY two antibiotics have been shown to sometimes decrease the effectiveness of birth control-- Rifampicin and Rifabutin. </p>

<ul>
<li>NHS Website: <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception-guide/pages/antibiotics-contraception.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception-guide/pages/antibiotics-contraception.aspx</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Yet websites of Pharmacies like Walgreens or CVS say that to a lesser extent Penicillin based antibiotics can decrease birth control effectiveness, or in general remain vague about antibiotics affecting birth control :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.walgreens.com/topic/faq/questionandanswer.jsp?questionTierId=600006&amp;faqId=600022"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.walgreens.com/topic/faq/questionandanswer.jsp?questionTierId=600006&amp;faqId=600022</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So--do Penicillin based antibiotics affect birth control?</p>
","<p>Evidence on the association between antibiotic use and combination oral contraceptive (COC) failure remains controversial, with recent studies reporting no evidence to support decreased effectiveness of birth control with the use of antibiotics except rifampin and rifabutin.</p>

<p>The reasoning is antibiotics might interfere with the effectiveness of COCs by decreasing steroid hormone’s plasma concentrations by hepatic microsomal enzyme induction or inhibition, interference with enterohepatic circulation of
COC metabolites, interference with absorption from the GI tract, competition between two drugs for the same metabolizing enzyme, alterations in plasma protein binding, induction of an opposite physiologic effect, or increased urinary or fecal excretion of the contraceptive.</p>

<p>As you stated, the strongest evidence is for rifabutin and rifampin: a significant decrease in the hormonal levels was noted in women taking rifampin even after <em>a single dose.</em>  Dirithromycin slightly decreased plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, with questionable clinical importance. A recent study in the Netherlands <em>did</em> find a relationship between the use of antibiotics and breakthrough pregnancy in a population-based <em>prescription</em> database; also, individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol when they take certain antibiotics, notably tetracycline and penicillin derivatives.  </p>

<p>Because of earlier studies, anecdotal reports, and the above (it's not possible to identify whose levels will drop with antibiotic use), a cautious approach is advised. Physicians and pharmacists (80-90% of both) still lean towards believing that broad-spectrum antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of COCs, and continue to advise the use of back-up contraception. </p>

<p>The tide is shifting, however, as new studies come out. Here are a few excerpts of recent studies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Available scientific and pharmacokinetic data do not support the hypothesis that antibiotics (with the exception of rifampin) lower the contraceptive efficacy of oral contraceptives. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2002;46:917-23.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since dermatologists treat acne with antibiotics, and a significant percentage of these patients are young women of child-bearing age, they certainly have a vested interest in knowing if this is true.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rifampicin and griseofulvin induce hepatic enzymes and do appear to have a genuine interaction with the COCP, leading to reduced efficacy. The situation with the broad-spectrum antibiotics is less clear. There are relatively few prospective studies of the pharmacokinetics of concurrent COCP and antibiotic use and few, if any, demonstrate a convincing basis for any reduced contraceptive efficacy.</p>
  
  <p>We did not find an association between concomitant antibiotic use and the risk of breakthrough pregnancy among COC users. However, due to limited power and potential carryover effects, findings from this study cannot rule out an elevated risk of COC failure among antibiotic users. (2011)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the answer is (except with your noted exceptions) the penicillin-class antibiotics <em>probably do not interfere with effectiveness of COCs.</em> However, one unwanted pregnancy is one pregnancy too many, and the use of a back-up method is not a huge deal (just ~14 days).</p>

<p>Until more and larger studies demonstrate a lack of interaction between most antibiotics and COCs, this will likely be the advice people continue to receive. When you look at the risk to benefit ratio of back-up, it's probably the wisest course for people prescribed a short course of antibiotics. It is more significantly problematic for people prescribed continuous antibiotic use for acne, Crohn's and other conditions/illnesses.</p>

"What is the difference between regular blood, a woman's and a virgin's menstrual blood?","23418","","<p>There are many stories that blood contains the life-force energy and specifically menstrual (period) blood has always been a feature of many rituals and some ancient Sumerian tablets mentioned that menstrual blood was the 'gold of the gods'.</p>

<p>So it is true that the menstrual blood is highly oxygenated, the purest of all blood and it carries the decoded DNA?</p>

<p><strong>Or what differences are known to modern science between regular blood, a woman's period blood and virgin's period blood?</strong></p>
","<p>The ""purest of all blood"" is fresh out of the bone marrow, i.e. in your circulatory system.</p>

<p>Menstrual blood is a combination of blood, some mucous, and dead endometrial tissue. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The endometrium consists of a single layer of columnar epithelium resting on the stroma, a layer of connective tissue that varies in thickness according to hormonal influences. Simple tubular uterine glands reach from the endometrial surface through to the base of the stroma, which also carries a rich blood supply of spiral arteries... Proliferation is induced by estrogen (follicular phase of menstrual cycle), and later changes in this layer are engendered by progesterone from the corpus luteum (luteal phase). It is adapted to provide an optimum environment for the implantation and growth of the embryo. In the absence of progesterone, the arteries supplying blood to the functional layer constrict, so that cells in that layer become ischaemic and die, leading to menstruation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, menstrual ""blood"" is a combination of sloughed off stromal and glandular tissue, broken down vascular cells and blood, and, no, it is not highly oxygenated (it's kind of darker than normal blood. It doesn't carry any ""decoded DNA"". It's basically a waste product at this point, dead, dying and no longer functional tissue.</p>

<p>Virgin's flow is just as dead as non-virgin's flow. Cultures obtained at hysterectomy indicate that the endometrial cavity is normally sterile. The major difference between a virgin and a non-virgin is that the possibility of infection of endometrial tissue exists in non-virgins.</p>

<p>Of course myths will arise around menstrual flow. After all, when it was alive, it was the medium for implantation of a blastocyst. But they are just myths.</p>

"What effect has changing pH and salt concentration on protein complexes?","23358","","<p>I'm struggling to find peer reviewed literature that explains the effect of changing the pH and the salt concentration on protein/protein complexes in solution. What effect does the pH and the salt concentration have and what is the physical basis behind this? </p>
","<p>The formation of protein complexes or aggregates in aqueous buffers is determined by a number of factors: physical properties of the protein itself, pH, temperature, type and concentration of the used cosolvent (salt). Solutes are often roughly divided by type into <strong>chaotropes</strong> ('disorder-making'), which destabilise protein structures and <strong>kosmotropes</strong> ('order-making'), which stabilize them. [<a href=""http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/kosmos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19994836"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>]</p>

<p>Chaotropic salts interfere with intramolecular interactions mediated by non-covalent forces such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions, which, at high cosolvent concentrations, results in protein denaturation. </p>

<p>Kosmotropic salts, on the other hand, cause water molecules to favorably interact, which also stabilizes intermolecular interactions in proteins. The salt molecules readily interact with water from the protein's hydratation shell and remove it from the protein surface, which produces thermodynamically unfavourable interactions that are reduced when proteins associate to form complexes. With increase in salt concentration the protein precipitation (salting out) increases.</p>

<p>Both cations and anions have been ranked separately by their capacity to precipitate proteins, to form a <strong>Hofmeister series</strong> [<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15306378"" rel=""nofollow"">3</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16821951"" rel=""nofollow"">4</a>] (first set in 1888 but still hotly debated), e.g.:</p>

<p>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> > H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> > CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup> > Cl<sup>−</sup> > Br<sup>−</sup> </p>

<p>At large salt concentrations protein solubility is given by the empirical <strong>Cohn equation</strong> [<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16814736"" rel=""nofollow"">6</a>]:</p>

<p><code>lnS = α − βc</code></p>

<p>where <code>S</code> is the protein solubility, <code>c</code> is the salt's ionic strength, <code>α</code> and <code>β</code> are empirical constants characteristic of particular salt.</p>

<p>Salting-out agents are very widely used in protein purification (to concentrate proteins eg. with ammonium sulfate), chromatography or crystalization.</p>

<p><strong>The influence of pH</strong> on protein-protein interactions in solution works through altering of the electrostatic properties of protein surfaces. At pH equal to the protein's isoelectric point (pI), where its net charge is neutral, charge repulsions of similar molecules are relatively low and many proteins will aggregate. Very low and very high pH will case proteins to denature; during digestion, for instance, proteins are in extremely low and then extremly high pH that exposes their backbones for enzymatic degradation.</p>

"If red blood cells have no mitochondria how are they able to metabolize glucose?","23310","","<p>I have read that red blood cells (RBCs) metabolize glucose. However they don't have any mitochondria because there is just so much hemoglobin that there is no room for mitochondria without expanding the cell. </p>

<p>So how is it possible for them to metabolize glucose if it is mainly O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, fatty acids (in cell membrane), and hemoglobin? </p>
","<p>In humans (and all mammals), red blood cells lack mitochondria and therefore has no functional TCA cycle. They metabolize glucose mainly via <a href=""http://humancyc.org/HUMAN/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=PWY66-400"" rel=""noreferrer"">glycolysis</a>, forming lactate which is released from the cells; this yields 2 ATP for each glucose molecule, much less than complete oxidation (ca 30 ATP), but enough to support the red blood cells' energy needs.</p>

<p>There is <em>some</em> oxidation of glucose to CO2 in red blood cells though. This occurs mainly in the <a href=""http://humancyc.org/HUMAN/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=PENTOSE-P-PWY"" rel=""noreferrer"">pentose phosphate pathway</a> or ""shunt"", where 1 carbon of glucose is released as CO2, and the energy extracted is used to reduce NADP to NADPH, which functions as an antioxidant. The resulting 5-carbon sugars (pentoses) are then rearranged to a 3-carbon sugar (glyceraldehyde phosphate) which enter glycolysis again. Hence the term ""shunt"": 5/6 of the glucose carbon that enter actually comes back to glycolysis again.</p>

<p>By varying flux through the PPP, cells can balance the use of glucose for ATP (energy) or NADPH (antioxidant). Studies estimate that in human red blood cells, 10--30% of hexokinase flux is diverted through the PPP, and the remainder through upper glycolysis (see <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1753-4887.1960.tb01772.x/abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165022X99000056"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> article). This corresponds to 2--5% of glucose carbon released as CO2, and the remainder metabolized to lactate.</p>

<p>Note that the above apply to mammalian red blood cells. Red cells of other vertebrates, including birds and fish, retain both their nucleus and mitochondria, and their metabolism is different.</p>

But, this is just a guess. I wonder what the official explanation is, if it exists.</p>
","<p><strong>Number of legs in terrestrial vertebrates</strong></p>

<p>Not only do mammals have four legs but actually all terrestrial vertebrates (which include mammals) have four legs. There are slight exceptions though as some lineages have lost their legs. Typically snakes have no legs anymore. <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7087/abs/nature04413.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Apesteguia and Zaher (2006)</a> discuss the evolution of snakes legs reduction and report a fossil of snakes with a robust sacrum. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cetaecea (whales and friends)</a> have lost their hind legs but we can still spot them on the skeleton.

<p>I also want to draw attention to the importance of the definition of legs.

If we are using some broader definition, then a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehensile_tail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prehensile tail</a> as found in some new world monkeys for example could be considered as a leg (but only a single leg, not a pair of legs obviously).

<p><strong>Did you say Natural Selection?</strong></p>

<p>I think (might be wrong) that you have too selectionist a view of evolution. What I mean is that you are wondering why mammals have four legs and you're looking for an explanation of the kind ""because mammal have this kind of need of locomotion and for this purpose four is the most optimal number of legs"". Consider the following sentence: ""If there is a need, natural selection will find a way!"". This sentence is wrong! Evolution is not that easy. This falsy view of evolution is sometimes reffered as panselectionist.</p>

<p>The reality is that it is not easy to evolve such a developmental pathway as drastic as having an extra pair of legs that is well integrated into the body of the carrier of this new trait. Such individual would need a brain, a nerve code, a heart and some other features that are adapted to have extra legs. Also, assuming such a thing came to existence it is rather complicated to imagine how it could be selected for. To go slightly further, you have to realize that there are many stochastic processes in evolution (including mutation and random variation in reproductive success) and an organism is a complex machinery and is not necessarily easily transformable to some other form that would be more efficient (have higher reproductive success). Often going from one form to another may involves a ""valley crossing"" meaning that if several mutations are needed, intermediate forms may have low reproductive success and therefore a high amount of genetic drift (stochasticity in reproductive success) to cross such valley of low reproductive success. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_balance_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shifting balance theory</a>. Finally, even if there is selection for another trait, it may take time for the mean trait in the population to shift especially if there is only little genetic variance. A complete discussion on why the sentence ""If there is a need, natural selection will find a way!"" is wrong would fill up a whole book.</p>

<p><a href=""http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/205/1161/581.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gould (1979)</a> is a classical article on the subject and is very easy to read even for a lay person. </p>

<p><strong>Why 4 legs?</strong></p>

<p>Terrestrial vertebrates have four legs because they evolved from a fish ancestor that had four members that were not too far from actual legs (members that could ""easily"" evolve into legs). This is what we call a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_phylogenetics#Phylogenetic_signal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">phylogenetic signal</a>. The explanation is as simple and basic as that. You can have a look to the diversity of terrestrial vertebrates <a href=""http://tolweb.org/Terrestrial_Vertebrates/14952"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (click on the branches).</p>

<p><strong>Number of legs in invertebrates</strong></p>

<p>Arthropda (Spiders (and other chelicerata), insects (and other hexapods), crustaceans (crabs, shrimps…) and Myriapoda (millipedes) and Trilobite as well)) evolved from a common ancestor who had a highly segmented body. From this ancestor many group have fused some segments. In these taxa, each pair of legs is attached to a particular segment (I don't think the segments are still visible in spiders today). In insects for example, all 6 legs are attached to the thorax but to 3 different segments of the thorax, the pro- meso and meta- thorax (see below).</p>

<p>As a sidenote, it is interesting to know that the wings in insects did not evolve from the legs (as it is the case in birds and bats). There are two competing hypotheses for the origin of insect wings. Wings either developed from gills or from sclerite (chitine plate, the hard part of the insect). When insect first wings, they actually evolved three pairs of wings (one on each segment of the thorax). At least one pair has then been lost in all modern species. In the diptera a second pair of wings has been lost and are replaced by halteres, particularly easy to spot in craneflies (see below picture). In millipedes the link between segmentation and legs is even more obvious (see picture below). You can have a look to the diversity of Arthropda <a href=""http://tolweb.org/Arthropoda/2469"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (click on the branches).</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>

<p>Asking how likely it is for a given population to evolve a given trait is extremely hard to answer. There are two main issues: 1) a definition of the question issue and 2) a knowledge issue. When asking for a probability one always needs to state the a priori knowledge. If everything is known a priori, then there is nothing stochastic (outside quantum physics). So to answer the question one has to decide what we take for granted and what we don't. The second issue is a knowledge issue. We are far from having enough knowledge in protein biophysics (and many other fields)  to answer that question. There are so many parameters to take into account. I would expect that creating a third pair of legs would need major changes and therefore one mutation will never be enough in order to develop a third pair of legs. But, no I cannot cite you any reference for this, I am just guessing! </p>

<p>Following the wings example in insects. Insects have had three pairs of wings. While some mutation(s) prevented the expression of the third (the first actually) pair many of the genetic information for this third pair remain in the genotype of insects as they still use it for the two other pairs. Taking advantage of that, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehopper"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Membracidae (treehoppers)</a> developed some features using similar biochemical pathway than the one use to develop wings. Those structures are used as protection or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">batesian mimicry</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Let's imagine that an extremely unlikely series of mutations occur that create some rodent with 6-legs. Let's imagine this rodent with six legs has a larger heart in order to pump blood to these extra legs and it has a brain that is adapted to using six legs and some changes in its nerve cord so that it can control its 3rd pair of legs. Will this rodent have higher reproductive success than other individuals in the population? Well… let's imagine that with its six legs, it can run faster or whatever and has a very high fitness. How would the offspring of a six-leg mother (or father) and a four-leg father (or mother) look like? Will it be able to reproduce? See the issue is that it is hard for such trait to come to existence because 1) it needs many steps (mutations) and 2) it is hard to imagine how it could be selected for. For those reasons, there exist no vertebrates with 6 fully functional legs.</p>

<p>Well, let's assume it does and in consequence after 200 generations or so, the whole population is only made of 6-legged individuals. Maybe the species got extinct then and no fossil record has ever been found. This is possible. It is not because something has existed that we necessarily find something in the fossil record.</p>

"Why does strenous exercise cause vision of ""lights""?","22898","","<p>I had a hard climb a week ago. I got so tired then any time I closed my eyes I saw these lights inside my head. I see these lights almost every time that I run fast or some thing like that. What are they and where do they come from?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eN5bc.jpg"" alt=""schematic representation""></p>

<p>Here is a picture I drew using Photoshop ;)</p>
","<p>This is a common phenomena which most of us come across. Seeing flashes of light, stars and other shapes in the eyes occur when the body goes through stressful activities. For example while you are climbing the blood flow will be more to other prominent parts like hands and lower waist so brain and eyes will get less supply of blood as well as nutrients. Hence those flashes or stars are visible to us. This phenomena is called ""Phosphene"" and a phosphene is a phenomenon characterized by the experience of seeing light without light actually entering the eye.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphene"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia/Phosphene</a> gives an explanation for occurrence of Phosphenes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phosphene is ""seeing stars"", from a sneeze, laughter, a heavy and deep cough, blowing of the nose, a blow on the head or low blood pressure (such as on standing up too quickly or prior to fainting). It is possible these involve some mechanical stimulation of the retina, but they may also involve mechanical and metabolic (such as from low oxygenation or lack of glucose) stimulation of neurons of the visual cortex or of other parts of the visual system.
  <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yD2EH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So seeing flashes of light can be due to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Blood shifting.</li>
<li>Low blood sugar(causes weakness).</li>
<li>Head trauma.</li>
<li>Headache.</li>
</ol>

<p>So to summarize this thing, we should have enough nutrients, water supply to the body whenever we come across stressful activities. Phosphenes are temporary stuff which do not harm eyes.</p>

"Why do toenails grow much slower than fingernails?","22283","","<p>As the title suggests, I've noticed that my fingernail grow much faster than my toenails. For instance, I usually trim my fingernails every two week or so, but for toenails the number would be about 6 to 8 weeks. </p>

<p>A bit of research revealed this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_%28anatomy%29"">wikipedia article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In mammals, the length and growth rate of nails is related to the length of the terminal phalanges (outermost finger bones). Thus, in humans, the nail of the index finger grows faster than that of the little finger; and fingernails grow up to four times faster than toenails. [12]</p>
  
  <p>In humans, nails grow at an average rate of 3 mm (0.12 in) a month.[13] Fingernails require three to six months to regrow completely, and toenails require 12 to 18 months. Actual growth rate is dependent upon age, sex, season, exercise level, diet, and hereditary factors. Nails grow faster in the summer than in any other season.[14]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation"">correlation does not imply causation</a>, so why should the growth rate of nails depend on the  length of the terminal phalanges? Then why do babies grow nail much faster? I wasn't satisfied by its answer, so I looked a bit more where I found <a href=""http://www-scf.usc.edu/~uscience/nail_growth.html"">this other article</a>. They had two possible candidates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>because hands are physically closer to the heart than are feet, fingers get better blood circulation and consequently better access to oxygen and nutrients.</p></li>
  <li><p>Fingernails experience almost constant trauma through tapping, typing, bumping, and other seemingly insignificant actions. These persistent minor traumas stimulate fingernail growth. Toes, on the other hand, are not exposed to nearly as much trauma as they are usually bundled up safely inside socks and shoes. Similarly, fingernails on a person's right hand grow faster in right-handed people than on their left hand and vice-versa.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However they don't give actual experimental results. So my question is which of the above is the real cause of this difference in the growth rate of nails; or simply why toenails grow much slower than fingernails?</p>

Also, fluorine being a <a href=""http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/f.htm"">crucial component in maintaining the solidity of bones</a>, the body may redirect more fluorine that is ingested by various means, to the hands than to the feet, due to the arguably more necessary functions of the hands (in that they are used them for agile and precise motions that tend to influence our survival), meaning less growth in toenails as evidenced in the first citation.</p>

"Calculation of the bacterial growth rate from a spectrophotomer growth curve","22256","","<p>Typically the microbial growth in liquid cultures is monitored by turbidity. Data is obtained with a spectrophotometer to measure optical density at 600nm. The slope of the bacterial kinetic curve in exponential phase is the growth rate.</p>

<p>But I have seen two ways of calculate the growth rate:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Growth rate = Maximum slope value of the Kinetic curve</p></li>
<li><p>$Log_{10}$ transformation of the growth data and then calculate the slope.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think the second one is right if you want to calculate the generation time:</p>

<p>generation time = $\frac{ln(2)}{Growth rate}$.</p>

<p>What is the correct way to calculate the growth rate and then generation time?</p>
","<p>This is a common experiment for microbiology courses and you can find instructions on the internet , here is an example from University of Wisconsin: <a href=""http://inst.bact.wisc.edu/inst/index.php?module=Book&amp;func=displayarticle&amp;art_id=114"">http://inst.bact.wisc.edu/inst/index.php?module=Book&amp;func=displayarticle&amp;art_id=114</a></p>

<p>But the general method is measure optical density at regular intervals and plot them on a semilog graph, which has the normal linear scale on the X axis for time, but a base 10 log scale on the Y axis for optical density. You can set this up in microsoft excel or libreoffice calc by right clicking the y axis and going to format axis, there should be a logarithmic scale option somewhere depending on the version. </p>

<p>After you have the data plotted, the exponential growth phase should appear as a line with positive slope. The logarithmic scale on the Y axis will automatically transform the exponential curve into a straight line. To determine growth rate in terms of generation per hour, you need to get the optical density at time 0, which is the beginning of the exponential phase, and time t, which is just some other time on the exponential phase. Use this equation to determine growth rate: $k =\frac{log(X_t) - log(X_0)}{0.301t}$</p>

<p>Once you know the growth rate, you can determine the generation time with $t_{gen} = \frac{1}{k}$, which gives time for 1 generation in hours. To convert to minutes, just multiply by 60.</p>

<p>As a side note, remember to blank your spectrophotometer with sterile media. Also, if the optical density goes over 2 it won't be as accurate, so dilute the aliquots to make the optical density go below 2. Remember to record the dilution factor so you can multiply the density by the dilution and get back to the ""original"" optical density for plotting.</p>

"Can one die from pain?","22196","","<p>Is it possible that a human or any other creature can die from pain?</p>

<p>I googled and found different answers. Some articles say Yes while others say No.</p>
","<p>I very much doubt it. You may however die from whatever's <em>causing</em> the pain. The reason you feel pain is so you stop doing whatever is causing the pain. Hence someone knows not to touch a hot fire because it is painful. But the pain itself is not actually the danger - it's the fire burning away skin. So pain is actually a good thing, a survival mechanism. So for something that is meant to prevent death it's hard to imagine it doing the opposite. </p>

<p>Perhaps if you were in SO much pain you may be unable to breath and paralysed - but even then I still think you'd go unconscious before that would happen, and you'd start breathing again, etc.</p>

<p>The only other thing I can imagine is having a cardiac event, and the heart stopping. Again, this would be because of stress. Other than that - you may commit suicide on account of insufferable pain, however it's a different situation.</p>

<p>However pain never comes on its own for no reason, just like smoke needs a fire. In this case it's the fire - not the smoke, that will kill you!</p>

<p>People who've ever been in a desperate or life threatening situation like a car accident, have often walked on a broken leg for example - feeling no pain. In this case the body was giving them a chance to escape what might have been a lion, etc.</p>

I am thinking why there is so big drop in pressure when going from arteries to arterioles (40-60).</p>

<p><strong>Why there is a great drop in pressure from arteries to arterioles?</strong></p>
","<p>While correct, @AndroidPenguin 's answer is only part of the explanation. By far the main reason of the pressure difference is that the peripheral circulatory system has two main compartments:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <strong>resistive</strong> compartment, represented by arterioles</li>
<li>a <strong>capacitance</strong> compartment, represented by capillaries</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for the abrupt pressure fall from arterioles onward is precisely that <strong>this is the main function of the arterioles</strong>: they contract and dilate to adjust capillary pressure. Since a good part of capillary function depends on exchanges along oncotic pressure gradients, hydrostatic pressure cannot be allowed to stay too high in the capillary compartment. So in conclusion, @AndroidPenguin gave you the physical reason, but mine is the physiological reason.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If DNA is in the form of a circular molecule, or if the ends are rigidly held so that it forms a loop, then overtwisting or undertwisting leads to the supercoiled state. Supercoiling occurs when the molecule relieves the helical stress by twisting around itself. Overtwisting leads to <strong>postive supercoiling</strong>, while undertwisting leads to <strong>negative supercoiling</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Positive and Negative Supercoilings</p>

  <li><p><strong>Negative supercoiling</strong> is the left-handed, double helical form of DNA.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Although the helix is underwound and has low twisting stress, negative supercoil's knot has high twisting stress. Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes usually have negative supercoiled DNA. Negative supercoiling is naturally prevalent because negative supercoiling prepares the molecule for processes that require separation of the DNA strands. For example, negative supercoiling would be advantageous in replication because it is easier to unwind whereas positive supercoiling is more condensed and would make separation difficult.</p>
  
  <p>Topoisomerases unwind helix to do DNA transcription and DNA replication. After the proteins have been made,the DNA template supercoils by the force to make chromatin. RNA polymerase also influence DNA strand to have two different supercoiled directions. The region RNA polymerase has passed forms negative supercoil while the region RNA polymerase that have not passed forms positive supercoil. By these processes, supercoils are generated.</p>

<p>For every cell that dies a new one must be born, so there must be at least between 50 and 70 billion cell divisions to replenish these cells in an adult human (no net growth).</p>

<p><strong>But then I remembered erythrocytes</strong>. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"">Wikipedia again</a>:</p>

"Why is weight gain a symptom of Cushing's Syndrome?","21980","","<p>Cushing's syndrome results from increased levels of cortisol in the body.</p>

<p>Cortisol as I understand it however, promotes the breakdown of glycogen and amino-acids in the process of gluconeogenesis, to increase blood sugar - opposing the action of insulin.</p>

<p>Why then does Cushing's syndrome lead to weight gain rather than weight loss?</p>
","<p>Cortisol is released when body goes through stress situations like while working out in gym, physiological activities outdoor etc. As you have already mentioned about what Cortisol does, it accumulates in the body after the stress situation and then with the intake of food and other nutrients it replaces the consumed carbohydrate and fat in the body i.e. a kind refueling. So this is how Cortisol maintains the body weight normally if our body gets enough exercise or has proper metabolism.</p>

<p>Whereas in Cushing' syndrome which comes usually by taking glucocorticoid drugs, or diseases that result in excess cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or CRH levels. In this case Cortisol content will be more than the normal level which in turn requires more carbohydrate. So cortisol metabolizes the food and reefuels the body even when there is no requirement within the body. So because of excessive cortisol content body simply gets excessive fat accumulated in various parts which mainly results in obesity.</p>

<p>One more explanation from <a href=""http://www.examiner.com/article/stress-and-obesity-101-what-are-the-effects-of-stress-induced-cortisol-on-obesity"" rel=""nofollow"">High level of Cortisol effects</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Chronically high levels of cortisol plays a big role in the development of obesity.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Cortisol helps the body handle stress; so, when stress goes up,
  cortisol also goes up. Cortisol stimulates fat and carbohydrate
  metabolism during stressful situations. This leads to increased blood
  sugar levels required for fast energy. In turn, this stimulates
  insulin release which can lead to an increase in appetite.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Adrenaline increases alertness and metabolism by helping fat cells release
  energy. When the immediate stress is over, the adrenaline levels
  return to normal. But, cortisol lingers to help bring the body back
  into balance after stress. One of the ways it gets things back to
  balance is by increasing appetite to replace the carbohydrate and fat
  used for the flight or fight response.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem is that in today's society, stress-causing situations do
  not really require the body to use up a lot of energy. So, cortisol
  ends up causing the body to refuel after stress even when it doesn't
  really need to refuel. This excess fuel or glucose is converted into
  fat resulting in increased storage of fat.</p>

"Will a bone marrow transplant change one's blood type?","21723","","<p>Will a bone marrow transplant change one's blood type?</p>

<p>Or is the donor blood type matched with the person before transplant?</p>
","<p>Bone Marrow transplants are extensively matched in order to prevent rejection. Current matching methodology is HLA matching: <a href=""http://www.lpch.org/DiseaseHealthInfo/HealthLibrary/hematology/bonetran.html"">Stanford Children's Hospital Guidelines</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How are a donor and recipient matched?</strong><br>
  Matching involves typing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue. The antigens on the surface of these special white blood cells determine the genetic make-up of a person's immune system. There are at least 100 HLA antigens; however, it is believed that there are a few major antigens that determine whether a donor and recipient match. The others are considered minor and their effect on a successful transplant is not as well defined.</p>
  
  <p>Medical research is still investigating the role all antigens play in the process of a bone marrow transplant. The more antigens that match, the better the engraftment of donated marrow. Engraftment of the stem cells occurs when the donated cells make their way to the marrow and begin reproducing new blood cells.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, because the HLA matching <em>doesn't</em> utilize blood-type and the recipient's marrow is destroyed in the process, then if the donor's marrow produces different red blood cells - <a href=""http://www.nationalcmlsociety.org/faq/stem-cellbone-marrow-transplant"">then so will the recipient</a> with time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Does my blood type change after SCT or [Bone Marrow Transplant]?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Yes.  The recipients blood type eventually changes to the donor type.  That means if you had a blood type of A+ prior to transplant and your donor had a blood type of O, eventually your blood type would become O.  I may take several weeks, possibly months for your original blood type to disappear, but eventually it will.  </p>

<p>What's interesting is that blood-typing is not be expressly necessary with the modern bone marrow transplant process. The danger of mixing two antagonistic blood types <em>in vivo</em> is that the recipient's immune system attacks the foreign red blood cells resulting in body-wide rejection. However, because the immune system's response capabilities are decimated by the destruction of the recipient's bone marrow (usually accomplished via chemotherapy or radiation), it can't mount much of an attack in the first place. That's not to say the body can't mount an attack, or that the donor's tissue can't mount an attack on the recipient (Graft-Versus-Host-Disease [GVHD]) - but the better the HLA match the less likely issues are to arise, which is why we do the more accurate and relevant HLA matching instead of blood-typing.</p>

<p>To explain in words, if the glycosidic bonds (which attach the nucleic base to the sugar in the backbone) stuck straight out at 90 angles on both sides, then the grooves in double-stranded DNA would be symmetrical.

"Are humans the only species who drink milk as adults?","21395","","<p>I was drinking a glass of milk the other day and that got me thinking that no other animal to my knowledge drinks milk past their infant stages. One could argue that cats might but it isn't good for them to do.</p>

<p><strong>Are humans the only animal that are able to drink milk as adults and not have it cause issues?</strong></p>

<p>Of course, I know some people do have lactose intolerance too.</p>
","<p>Good observation!</p>

<h1>Gene coding for the lactase</h1>

<p><strong>Gene LCT</strong></p>

<p>Mammals have a gene (called <code>LCT C/T-13910</code>) coding for the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase"" rel=""noreferrer"">lactase</a> enzyme, a protein able to digest <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose"" rel=""noreferrer"">lactose</a>. Lactose is a disaccharide sugar found in milk.</p>

<p><strong>Expression of LCT</strong></p>

<p>In mammals, the gene LCT is normally expressed (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"" rel=""noreferrer"">gene expression</a>) only early in development, when the baby feeds on his/her mother's milk. Some human lineages have evolved the ability to express LCT all life long, allowing them to drink milk and digest lactose at any age.</p>

<p>Today, the inability to digest lactose at all ages in humans is called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance"" rel=""noreferrer"">lactose intolerance</a>.</p>

<h1>Evolution of lactose tolerance in human</h1>

<p><strong>Three independent mutations</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672153/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tishkoff et al. 2007</a> found that the ability to express LCT at an old age has evolved at least three times independently. Indeed, they found three different <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"" rel=""noreferrer"">SNPs</a> (stands for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; it is a common type of mutation), two of them having high prevalence in Africa (and people of African descent) and one having high prevalence in Europe (and people of European descent). The three SNPs are <code>G/C-14010</code>, <code>T/G-13915</code> and <code>C/G-13907</code>. </p>

<p><strong>Pastoralist populations</strong></p>

<p>Lactose tolerance is much more common in people descending from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoralism"" rel=""noreferrer"">pastoralist</a> populations than in people descending from non-pastoralist populations, suggesting a strong selection for lactose tolerance <a href=""https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=1p8VGLiRByEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Durham%20WH.%20Coevolution:%20Genes,%20Culture,%20and%20Human%20Diversity&amp;ots=O74ncVyAkj&amp;sig=d4r_7Y7_Y6u2r7bamPj8DXNTzrA#v=onepage&amp;q=Durham%20WH.%20Coevolution%3A%20Genes%2C%20Culture%2C%20and%20Human%20Diversity&amp;f=false"" rel=""noreferrer"">Durham 1991</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Selective sweep</strong></p>

<p>On top of that, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672153/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tishkoff et al. 2007</a> focusing on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"" rel=""noreferrer"">locus</a> <code>14010</code> (one of the three SNP's mentioned above) showed that there is a clear <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_sweep"" rel=""noreferrer"">selective sweep</a> (which is a <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42374/is-there-a-formal-definition-of-signature-of-natural-selection"">signature</a> of past and present selection) around this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"" rel=""noreferrer"">locus</a>.</p>

<p>They estimated the age of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"" rel=""noreferrer"">allele</a> allowing lactose tolerance at this locus (allele <code>C</code> is derived, the ancestral being <code>G</code>; see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"" rel=""noreferrer"">nucleotide</a>) at around 3,000 to 7,000 years (with a 95% <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"" rel=""noreferrer"">confidence interval</a> ranging from 1,200 to 23,200 years) and a selection coefficient of 0.04 - 0.097 (with a 95% <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"" rel=""noreferrer"">confidence interval</a> ranging from 0.01 to 0.15). </p>

<p>I recommend reading <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672153/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tishkoff et al. 2007</a>. It is a classic, is short and is relatively easy to read, even for someone with only basic knowledge in evolutionary biology.</p>

<h1>Are humans the only animal that are able to drink milk as adults?</h1>

<p>I don't really know... but I would think so, yes!</p>

<p><strong>Drink vs digest thoroughly</strong></p>

<p>As @anongoodnurse rightly said in his/her answer</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Drink"" and ""digest thoroughly"" are two different things</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Pets</strong></p>

<p>According to many dog health websites (such <a href=""https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-feeding-tips/dogs-milk-dairy-products/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a> for example) claim that there is also variance among dogs where some dogs are lactose tolerant and others are lactose intolerant. I could not find any paper on the underlying genetics of lactose intolerance in dogs or other pets. It is not impossible our pets have also been under selection to be able to digest lactose as, we humans could have given milk to them. It is also possible that pets do not actually produce any lactase at adult age but rather that some pets are just able to deal with having indigestible lactose in their guts! But then again, <code>""Drink"" and ""digest thoroughly"" are two different things</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Tits and robins in 20th century England</strong></p>

<p>A funny and famous case is the case of blue tits and robins in the 20th century, in England. At that time, in England, the milkman was bringing the milk at home in the morning and would leave glass bottles with a simple aluminium cap in front of people's home. At some point, blue tits and robins learnt that by pecking through the aluminum they can get access to the milk. See <a href=""http://www.britishbirdlovers.co.uk/articles/blue-tits-and-milk-bottle-tops"" rel=""noreferrer"">this (non peer-reviewed) article</a> that tells the story.</p>

</ul>

<p>Is there any biological proof to consider <strong>White Eggs</strong> either as vegetarian or non-vegetarian?</p>
","<p>Of course eggs are not vegetarian. Eggs are, well, the <em>eggs</em> of chickens (usually). Chickens are animals so their eggs are animal matter as well. Whether or not the egg has been fertilized is completely irrelevant, eggs are chicken just as much as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drumstick_%28poultry%29#Cuts_of_poultry"">drumsticks</a> are.</p>

<p>The color of the egg has nothing at all to do with it. All eggs are, by definition, animal cells. Basically, the chicken's egg is the equivalent to the human <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_cell"">ovum</a>. In both humans and chickens, the female will regularly produce eggs and discard them. In the case of a human woman this is the monthly period. When an egg is not fertilized, it is discarded along with some cells of the wall of the uterus. Similarly, in chickens, the female produces and lays eggs. If an egg has been fertilized, it can grow into a new chicken. If it has not been fertilized, it cannot become a new chicken but is most certainly still an animal cell.   </p>

<p>So yes, eggs are most certainly animal, not plant or any other kind of matter. Whether or not you should eat them is up to your own moral guidelines to decide. While they are animal tissue, no animal has been killed to obtain them and no harm comes to the chicken if we harvest them. </p>

"Why do FSH and LH hormones drop in diagram when maturing follicle and does size of follicle change during menstruation phase","21263","","<p>There are three phases in menstrual cycle. In follicular phase of menstrual cycle, the level of FSH and LH would rise because they would stimulate ovarian follicle to mature. However, when I check with diagram of menstrual cycle, I find FSH and LH hormones do actually decrease during day 4-14. Is that because of increase of oestrogen? However, by the time when FSH decreases, the follicle hasn't fully matured. Also, will follicle grow during menstruation, because in diagram, the size of follicle actually changes during Day 0-4, and FSH and LH hormones increases.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>I find FSH and LH hormones do actually
  decrease during day 4-14. Is that because of increase of
  oestrogen？</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You first need to note that during one ovarian cycle, multiple follicles are stimulated to grow at the same time by FSH. However, one follicle ends up being the dominant follicle, and it is the oocyte housed within this follicle that is released on day 14. The dominant follicle is the one whose cells express gonadotropin receptors the earliest and so have the greatest sensitivity to FSH. Its growth would outcompete the other developing follicles. During days 4–14, FSH begins to decline because the granulosa cells of the follicles secrete inhibin, which—just like in males—causes the release of FSH and LH from the pituitary to drop. Only the dominant follicle is capable of withstanding this FSH drop; the other developing follicles are thus eliminated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, another question is will follicle
  grow during menstruation, because on diagram,the size of follicle
  actually changes during Day 0-4, and FSH and LH hormones increases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As user19099 explains, yes, follicles grow during menstruation. With the degeneration of the corpus luteum, the negative feedback effect of estrogen and progesterone (in combination) on the hypothalamus is relieved. Thus, GnRH levels increase, causing FSH and LH levels to increase (as reflected on the graph you included), and FSH will stimulate follicular development.</p>

<p>In the above video it shows that during DNA replication, the lagging strand require RNA primase to add 3' -OH group for further addition of nucleotides. However, it hasn't been shown that the above strand ( leading strand) require it.</p>

<p>Besides, RNA is needed to initiate the polymerization because it has the 3'-OH.
But when I look at the structure of deoxynucleotide, it also has the 3'-OH but it does not have the 2'-OH. So why DNA cannot initiate the polymerization? </p>

<p>Thanks for your answer!</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DNA polymerase</a> also needs a RNA primer on the leading strand to be able to start polymerization. Afterwards this is not needed anymore, since the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">replication</a> goes on without a break. On the lagging strand polymerization replication can only work between the replication fork and the next region of double-stranded DNA.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TeaqU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The reason for the need for RNA primers is located in the function of the enzymes.

<p>This is a <em>non-sequitur</em>. An animal being poisonous does not imply that it resists to poison, nor the reverse is true.</p>

<p>In any case, to the extent of my knowledge pigs do not produce any specific poison. Obviously, if you could provide a more specific claim, this could be tested a bit more in depth.</p>

<p>The second part, instead, is plain false. You can definitely kill a pig with strychnine.</p>

<p>Sure, pigs do have parasites. <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IPOsWhQgNPkC&amp;pg=PA904"">Chapter 55</a> of <em>Diseases of swine</em> is specifically on parasitic infections.</p>

<p>Now, do ALL pigs have them? The answer is no, some parasites are more common than other, and the amount of parasites depends on the health status of the farm.</p>

Individual faecal analyses (mean: 27.9 per herd) from eight age categories of swine showed that Ascaris suum, Oesophagostomum spp., Isospora suis, and Eimeria spp. were common, while Trichuris suis and Strongyloides ransomi-like eggs occurred sporadically. Large fatteners and gilts were most frequently infected with A. suum with maximum prevalences of 25-35% in DK, N and S, 13% in I and 5% in FIN. With the exception of the remarkably low A. suum prevalence rates in FIN, no clear national differences were observed. Oesophagostomum spp. were most prevalent in adult pigs in the southern regions (21-43% in DK and southern S), less common in the northern regions (4-17% adult pigs infected), and not recorded in I. I. suis was common in piglets in DK, I, and S (20-32%), while &lt; 1% and 5% were infected in N and FIN, respectively. Eimeria spp. had the highest prevalences in adult pigs (max. 9%) without clear geographical differences. I. suis and Eimeria spp. were recorded for the first time in I, and I. suis for the first time in N.</p>

Of the 3636 pigs sampled, 209 (5.7%) were infected with Trichuris suis, 189 (5.2%) with Ascaris, 91 (2.5%) with Oesophagostomum spp., 905 (24.9%) with coccidia (Eimeria spp. and/or Isospora suis) and 1716 (47.2%) with Balantidium coli. <strong>These infected pigs were mainly from farms without a strategic anti-parasite treatment regime</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, note that <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10831052"">Boes et al. 2000</a> reports higher percentages.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The prevalence of helminths in pigs was investigated in five rural communities situated on the embankment of Dongting Lake in Zhiyang County, Hunan Province, People's Republic of China, in an area known to be endemic for Schistosoma japonicum.

  <p>There is no safe temperature at which pork can be cooked to ensure that they will be killed</p>

<p>False. Proper cooking, as well as freezing (but see below) are effective in killing worms.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/trichinellosis/gen_info/faqs.html"">The CDC</a> suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best way to prevent trichinellosis is to cook meat to safe temperatures. A food thermometer should be used to measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. Do not sample meat until it is cooked. USDA recommends the following for meat preparation.</p>
  
  <p><strong>For Whole Cuts of Meat (excluding poultry and wild game)</strong><br>
  Cook to at least 145° F (63° C) as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming.<br>
  <strong>For Ground Meat (excluding poultry and wild game)</strong><br>
  Cook to at least 160° F (71° C); ground meats do not require a rest time.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Curing (salting), drying, smoking, or microwaving meat alone does not consistently kill infective worms; homemade jerky and sausage were the cause of many cases of trichinellosis reported to CDC in recent years.<br>
  Freeze pork less than 6 inches thick for 20 days at 5°F (-15°C) to kill any worms.<br>
  Freezing wild game meats, unlike freezing pork products, may not effectively kill all worms because some worm species that infect wild game animals are freeze-resistant.<br>
  Clean meat grinders thoroughly after each use.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>The swine carries about 30 diseases which can be easily passed to humans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, sure pigs can carry diseases that can be passed to humans, but proper storing and cooking of meat is effective in getting rid of the great majority of bacteria.</p>

<p>Finally in 2012 <a href=""http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/2012PressReleases/120613HPAissuesfoodsafetyreminder/"">Public health England</a> reported food poisoning caused by red meat as accounting for 17% of all food poisoning incidents, with pork accounting for 3%.

<p>Similarly, the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/attribution-1998-2008.html"">CDC report on the Attribution of Foodborn Illness</a> (1998-2008) puts red meat accounting for 12%, pork as accounting for 5.4% and poultry 9.8%.</p>

<p>With regard to terrestrial oxygen production, <a href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/ForestCarbon/"">NASA</a> reports that 30% of the land is covered by trees, and as much as 45 percent of the carbon stored on land is tied up in forests.

"Are male and female brains physically different from birth?","20509","","<p>Male and female brains are wired differently according to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/02/men-women-brains-wired-differently"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maps of neural circuitry showed that on average women's brains were highly connected across the left and right hemispheres, in contrast to men's brains, where the connections were typically stronger between the front and back regions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But since learning in the brain is associated with changes of connection
strengths between neurons, this could be or not the result of learning. 
What about physical differences from birth? Are there differences in size, regions, chemical composition, etc. from birth?  </p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Yes, men and women's brains are different before birth.  </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
First off, learning effects versus genetic differences is the familiar nature versus nurture issue. Several <strong>genes</strong> on the <a href=""https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/Y"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Y-chromosome</strong></a>, unique to males, are expressed in the pre-natal brain. In fact, about a third of the genes on the Y-chromosome are expressed in the male prenatal brain <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/mp200979"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Reinius &amp; Jazin, 2009)</a>. Hence, there are substantial genetic differences between male and female brains.  </p>

<p>Importantly, the male testes start producing testosterone in the developing fetus. The female hormones have opposing effects on the brain as <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"" rel=""noreferrer"">testosterone</a></strong>. In neural regions with appropriate receptors, testosterone influences patterns of <strong>cell death and survival</strong>, neural <strong>connectivity</strong> and <strong>neurochemical composition</strong>. In turn, while recognizing post-natal behavior is subject to parenting influences and others, prenatal testosterone <em>may</em> affect play behaviors between males and females, whereas influences on sexual orientation appear to be less dramatic <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17074984"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Hines, 2006)</a>. </p>

<p>The question is quite broad and I would start with the cited review articles below, or if need be, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_sex_differences"" rel=""noreferrer"">the wikipedia page on the Neuroscience of sex differences</a>.</p>

","<p>The difference boils down to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UnTranslated Regions</a>. A CDS or coding sequence is the part of a transcript that is actually translated into protein. Therefore a CDS will (almost) always start with an AUG codon and stop at one of the three STOP codons (UAA,UGA,UAG).</p>

<p>The transcript however (note that I am referring to mature transcripts that have already been spliced so introns have been removed) will also contain the UTRs which are not actually translated into protein. A cDNA sequence is derived from the transcript by reverse transcription and will, therefore, also contain the 5' and 3' UTRs. For example, see this schematic diagram of an unspliced transcript:</p>

"What are the risks of elevating the legs too regularly and when tired?","20425","","<p>I started to to think the pathophysiology of elevating legs high next to the wall too often and when you are tired. 
I think possible manifestations</p>

<ul>
<li>some damage to valves of the veins (<strong>No!</strong>)</li>
<li>because of collateral circulation, rhombus, heart damage, ... (<strong>No!</strong> Only in pathological situation but cannot be considered here. I think here that the risk of thrombus leaving legs is higher when you elevate your legs.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other side is when you should do this. 
To do regularly like every evening - may not be the right way to go. 
If you are tired and you do this, the vasomotor tonus is already lower so smooth muscles can less help to keep the blood so much more stress to the valves. 
Cardiac output is also less because of tiredness so lymphatic drainage is less. 
Elevating legs will move more lymph and blood to the middle of the body. 
So less lymph and blood can be moved back to legs when you tired. </p>

<p><strong>What are the risks of elevating legs for too long time in Short time and Long time?</strong> 
Is there any advantage in elevating legs like increasing blood circulation of our body? </p>

<h2>In what manner would elevating legs harm valves?</h2>

<p>There should be no damage to valves because the direction of the blood circulation does not change. 
Blood is only going from legs to heart. 
I think the vasoconstriction of smooth muscles occurs first in the legs. 
This returns some blood to the legs. </p>

<h2>How is lymph made - -?</h2>

<p>Lymph is made in lymph nodes. 
After leaving the node, it is rich in lymphocytes. 
After leaving digestive system, it is rich in triglycerides so called chyle. 
I think after leaving legs it is also rich in triglycerides. </p>

<h2>[W]hat is the danger of lymph leaving the legs?</h2>

<p>I think the effective lymph (that one used in legs) is coming from the lymph nodes of the legs. 
Some lymph can be made in lymph nodes of legs so no danger of lymph leaving legs. 
However, some may come from the region of coxa. 
<strong>How long distance can lymph travel as effective unit of immune system?</strong></p>

<p>If all lymph nodes are working, there is no danger of lymph leaving the legs, I think. 
If there are problems with lymph nodes of legs, then there may occur some constitutional symptoms of legs - but not sure about how fast. </p>

<h2>Does the heart get tired like your head does, or like muscles after exercise?</h2>

<p>No.</p>
","<p>To answer your questions, one needs to address certain issues one at a time.</p>

<p>Veins do have valves, but they function to hold blood from settling in the legs. When you flex muscles, the blood flows towards the heart. Valve failure occurs when people stand (especially if they stand relatively still) for long periods of time every day over many years, dilating veins. You can see this on the surface of the legs as varicose veins. One way to treat varicose veins is with <em>elevation</em>. So, elevation does not harm vein valves.</p>

<p>Lymph is made at the arterial end of capillaries and is part of the interstitial fluid of tissues. It bathes cells, and returns to the circulation via the lymphatic system (which also has one-way valves), goes through lymph nodes, and returns to the blood via connections with the subclavian veins. The treatment for too much lymph in the lower extremities (also known as edema) is to <em>elevate the legs</em>. So, elevation does not harm the lymphatics system.</p>

<p>The heart was made to pump all day, every day, for many, many years. It doesn't get ""tired"" during a tiring day, and doesn't need to rest like we do. But it can get weak and pump inefficiently if injured (e.g. myocarditis, myocardial infarct), or if it pumps against high arterial pressure (hypertension).</p>

<p>As long as you have healthy arteries to the legs, I can't see how your legs can suffer by elevation.</p>

<p>The main effect that I can think of is on baroreceptors. The increased volume of blood in your upper body will cause an increased stroke volume from the heart, sensed by baroreceptors, and may cause smooth muscle dilation of the vascular system. In the short term, that means you will experience more pronounced orthostatic hypotension on standing (you will be dizzier). The long-term effect from elevation for a couple of hours a day are basically nil.</p>

<p>Since you asked about these parameters only, I won't elucidate on other possible effects.</p>

","<p>Depending on how much detail you want to see, 400X (as Chris commented) is definitely sufficient. Remember, the lens(es) under/over the stage are labeled 10X, 20X, 40X, etc., while the eyepiece is generally 10X or perhaps 20X (multiplying the two together gives the final magnification). If your target magnification is 400X, then get a 400X scope - it doesn't need to be rated any higher than the highest magnification you want. 600X sounds nice, it's actually higher than the (non-digital) scopes I routinely use for examining mammalian cell cultures. 400-600X should give a very clear detail of both red and white blood cells. </p>

"Are humans the only animal that requires ""clean water""?","20147","","<p>I've seen a number of animals - dogs, cats, squirrels, ducks and geese, etc drink from puddles, some of them were muddy, others had green flora growing under water. Same goes for lakes and rivers. A human would not drink that. Do animals experience gastrointestinal discomfort or can they die from drinking water like that?</p>

<p>At the same time I hear about the problem of ""clean water"" in 3rd world countries and how diarrhea is the #1 killer of children under 5. </p>

<p><strong>Are humans the only animals that require a certain purity of their drinking water?</strong> Why is it that a dog can drink from a puddle, but a human is likely to get sick from doing the same? Do baby animals get sick from drinking ""dirty"" water?</p>
","<p>I wouldn't say that a human is ""likely"" to get sick by drinking from a puddle, I'd say ""at some risk"". It isn't <em>desperately</em> dangerous, although don't take that as a recommendation. There are many infections you can get from water (bacterial, viral, amoebal, and I presume fungal). You don't want to risk them, but <em>probably</em> won't actually encounter them in that puddle in your garden you see your dog drinking from. If the water is stagnant then the list of things in it that might hurt you is longer than if it's flowing. If you can avoid the mud, and anything that's been standing long enough to grow algae, fresh rainwater is a pretty good bet as these things go.</p>

<p>The same is true of other species, but the risk per drink is lower, since they drink it more and develop resistance to more of the things on the list. Humans are no different. For example some areas tend to have Hepatitis A in the tap water. The local population is immune after they've been infected once, and most childhood infections cause no symptoms, so it's not a problem for the locals. But to an unvaccinated visitor, the water's not safe. Hep A normally won't kill you, but is still well worth avoiding since it will make you sick for several weeks.</p>

<p>So basically, humans drink clean water because we can, not because we absolutely need to.</p>

<p>The lifespan of humans living ""in the wild"" (that is, populations prior to or independent of human agriculture) is pretty well agreed to be rather less than that of typical modern lifestyles. Water-borne disease is only one of many things responsible for that. The expected lifespan of a person used to purified water and so on, dropped into ""the wild"", is even lower again.</p>

<p>The ""clean-water"" problem in developing countries is primarily one of high population, relative to what the same area could possibly support in the absence of agriculture and other technology. The biggest risk of water-borne disease comes from contamination by human waste (although there are other sources, for example rats can contaminate water with Weil's disease). A small group of humans living in a large area doesn't have to worry about human contamination, they just drink upstream of where they defecate. This strategy doesn't help much once the population is dense enough that someone else is doing the same thing 20 metres away from you.</p>

<p>And of course, human agriculture also supports a much higher rat population than would otherwise be present (they're omnivores too, so they'll eat pretty much any food humans do). I suspect most human disease can be blamed on agriculture one way or another: if not on the animals then on the close-quarters living. If the population of humans was closer to what it was in the palaeolithic (a few thousand or tens of thousands of people in Europe), and was used to drinking from natural sources, then the water would be mostly (not entirely) safe.</p>

<p>So it's not so much that humans need perfectly clean water, it's that <strong>humans have figured out how to live in populations so large that we tend to make all the nearby water particularly dirty</strong>. Other species aren't completely unaffected by this, but they are <em>less</em> affected because our waste is specifically contaminating the water with diseases that affect us.</p>

"What is the difference between SOLiD, 454, and Illumina next-gen sequencing?","19585","","<p>I've started teaching myself about next-generation sequencing in preparation for a new job, and I'm wondering what the main differences are between the 454, SOLiD, and Illumina/Solexa machines, in terms of sample/library preparation and chemistry. How difficult is it for a protein veteran but next-gen newbie to get high-quality useful reads? I'm mainly going to be looking at antibody diversity, but consider this in general terms for any next-gen project.</p>

<p>I understand the basic theory of fluorescent chain-termination sequencing, but it's been a number of years since I last did it, and my career is now taking me back into the DNA realm.</p>
","<p>Here is a short summary of the sequencing technologies you listed. Illumina is the most frequently used one.</p>

<p>Roche/454 FLX Pyrosequencer technology is based on pyrosequencing method, which utilizes the use of the enzymes ATP sulfurylase and luciferase. After the incorporation of each nucleotide by DNA polymerase, a pyrophosphate is released, which further takes part in downstream light-producing reactions. The amount of light is proportional to the incorporated number of nucleotides. The DNA is fragmented and adapters are ligated at both ends. The fragments are mixed with agarose beads, which carry adapters complementary to the library adapters, and thus each bead is associated with a unique DNA fragment. The beads and DNA fragments are isolated in individual micelles, where emulsion PCR takes place and million copies of the single fragments are amplified  onto the surface of each bead. Each bead is placed in a well of picotiter plate (PTP), as the wells have dimensions such that only one bead can fit per well. Enzymes are added to the beads and pure nucleotide solutions are added with an immediate imaging step. On one side of the array a CCD (charge-optic device) camera records the light emitted from each bead. The first four nucleotides (TCGA) are the same as the start of the adapter, which allows for the emitted light to be calibrated according to the type of nucleotide added. The major disadvantage of this method is the misinterpretation of homopolymers (consecutive nucleotides, e.g. AAA or CCC). Such areas are prone to insertions or deletions, as the length of the stretch can be inferred only by the intensity of the light emitted. On the other hand, substitution errors are very unlikely. The 454 FLX instrument generates ~400 000 reads per instrument-run, as the reads are 200-400bp. The greatest advantage of this platform is the read length, which is the longest of all second generation technologies. Although sequencing on 454 platform is more expensive than sequencing on Illumina platform (40USD per Mega base versus 2USD per Mega base), it could still be the best choice for de novo assembly or metagenomics applications. (Mardis, E., 2008, Shendure, J. and Ji, H., 2008).</p>

<p>Illumina is the most frequently used one. The DNA to be sequenced is fragmented into about 200 base strands. Adapters are ligated onto the ends of the fragments and one of these adapters is hybridized on a flow cell. Illumina essentially utilizes a unique ""bridged"" amplification reaction that occurs on the surface of the flow cell. Localized PCR reaction is performed, and each of the hybridized pieces of DNA will get locally amplified to generate clusters which will have the exact same molecule. Subsequently, the DNA sequence is determined by adding a primer on one of the ends of the molecule. A mixture of modified nucleotides is added. Each one of them carries a base-specific fluorescent label attached to it. Also, each one has the 3' OH group blocked which ensures the incorporation of one nucleotide at a time.  The flow cell is placed under a microscope and when light is shined on its fluorescence, the emission light shows which base was incorporated on each one of those clusters. The Illumina read length is approximately 35 bases, but over billion reads are generated at a time. The major error type is substitution, rather than deletion or insertion (Mardis, E., 2008, Shendure, J. and Ji, H., 2008).</p>

<p>The SOLiD platform utilizes the use of DNA fragmented library, which is flanked by ligated adapters. The fragments are attached to small paramagnetic beads and emulsion PCR is performed to amplify the fragments. In contrast to the other sequencing platforms, sequencing by synthesis is performed by utilizing DNA ligase, rather than polymerase. Each cycle of sequencing involves the ligation of a degenerate population of fluorescently labeled universal octamer primers. A specific position of the octamer (e.g., base 5) carries a fluorescent label. After ligation, images are acquired in four channels, followed by cleavage of the octamer between positions 5 and 6, removing the fluorescent label. After several rounds of octamer ligation, which enable sequencing of every 5th base (e.g., bases 5, 10, 15, and 20), the extended primer is denatured. Different primers can be used to examine the previous or next positions (e.g., base 3 or 6).  The platform can use primers which carry two adjacent correlated with label bases. This approach involves the examination of the bases twice in a cycle, which decreases the error rates. SOLiD read lengths are 25-35 bp, and each sequencing run yields 2–4 Gb of DNA sequence data (Mardis, E., 2008, Shendure, J. and Ji, H., 2008).</p>

"What causes muscles to generate heat on contraction?","19446","","<p>I'm curious what the exact cause is of dramatic heat generation that comes along with muscle activity. Can anybody explain this in understandable language?</p>
","<p>First, it might be helpful to talk briefly about what heat is. It is a form of energy - molecular energy. Basically, heat is the amount of jiggliness of the molecules of a substance or object. When we look at a hot object, it doesn't apear to be moving any more than a cold object, but on a scale much smaller than we can see, it's molecules are moving faster than in a colder object. <a href=""http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/thermalP/Lesson-1/What-is-Heat"">Read this</a> for more information if you want.</p>

<p>There are at least two things going on in muscle contraction (as well as in other metabolic processes) which produce heat. The first is the chemical reaction that powers muscle contraction. You probably don't want to get into great detail, but basically there is a molecule which your cells use to store power, which we abbreviate as ATP. When our muscles use that power, an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic_reaction"">exothermic</a> chemical reaction occurs that ""burns"" ATP, breaking it into two pieces (ADP and phosphate). That reaction releases energy. Some of that energy is used in the actual movement of the muscle. But some of it just ""jiggles"" the nearby molecules. Again that jiggling is the very definition of heat.</p>

<p>The second source of heat is probably much smaller: friction. In short, just about any time <em>anything</em> moves, nearby molecules get jiggled some more. Imagine trying to walk through a room packed full of harps. Everywhere you move, some of those strings get plucked and vibrate. It's a little bit like that. When your muscle fibers tighten and flex, they rub past each other and jiggle each others atoms. All of that jiggliness <em>is heat,</em> and the jiggling continues until it can transfer to some other medium, as when, <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/sweat.html"">sweat evaporates</a> from your skin.</p>

"Why is a lack of oxygen fatal to cells?","19282","","<p>In animals temporary anaerobic respiration leads to the breakdown of the pyruvate formed by glycolysis into lactate.  The buildup of lactate in the bloodstream is accompanied by a large number of protons causing lactic acidosis, which is detrimental to the health of the organism.  This is one of the main suggestions I have come across for why a lack of oxygen is fatal to cells, however the LD<sub>50</sub> for lactic acid as referenced by the <a href=""http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9924446"">COSHH MSDS</a> seem awfully high (even if the route is by ingestion rather than directly into the bloodstream) for this to be a cause of cell death:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Toxicological Data on Ingredients: 
  ORAL (LD50): Acute:</strong> </p>
  
  <p>3543 mg/kg [Rat (Lactic Acid (CAS no. 50-21-5))]. </p>
  
  <p>4875 mg/kg [Mouse (Lactic Acid (CAS no. 50-21-5))].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also wonder if this is a larger problem for an organism as a whole rather than on a cellular level.</p>

<p>The alternative, I suppose, is that glycolysis alone does not provide sufficient ATP for vital cellular processes to occur.  If this is the case, which ATP requiring processes are most vital for the short term survival for a cell? </p>
","<p>Here's an illustrated example in neurons:</p>

<p>ATP, of course, is generated by aerobic respiration. The critical biochemical reaction in the brain that is halted due to lack of ATP (and therefore O2) is the glutmaine synthetase reaction, which is very important for the metabolism and excretion of nitrogenous wastes:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lCUXV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The body uses this reaction to dump excess ammonia (which is a metabolic waste product) on glutamate to make glutamine. The glutamine is then transported via the circulatory system to the kidney, where the terminal amino group is hydrolyzed by glutaminase, and the free ammonium ion is excreted in the urine.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OX4lq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Therefore, as you'd expect, under hypoxic conditions in the brain, excess ammonia builds up which is very toxic to the cells. Neurons are also highly metabolically active, which means they generate more waste products. A buildup of nitrogenous waste products in the cell (and bloodstream) can be potentially fatal due to it's effects on pH (screws up enzymes and a whole slew of biochemical reactions).</p>

<p>In addition, the buildup of ammonia will cause glutamate dehydrogenase to convert ammonia + aKG to glutamate, which depletes the brain of alpha-ketoglutarate (key intermediate in TCA cycle). This basically creates a logjam in the central metabolic cycle which further depletes the cell of energy.</p>

<p><strong>This is just one example of many.</strong> Of course, there are many, many other critical metabolic processes that require ATP (i.e. the Na+/K+ ATPase pump that regulates neuronal firing and osmotic pressure), but nitrogen metabolism was the first that came to mind :)</p>

","<h3> Short Answer </h3>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This page</a> on wikipedia gives a good synopsis of these concepts. </p>

<p>The confusion lies in the fact that <strong>many websites on anatomy discuss/describe/define these terms in relation to humans</strong>. However, in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupedalism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quadrupeds</a> and fish (<em>and</em>  <a href=""http://www.pbase.com/image/140434563"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">birds</a>), Anterior/Posterior lies orthogonal to Ventral/Dorsal and are instead synonymous with Cranial(Rostral)/Caudal. Examining the etymologies of the 4 terms in question will demonstrate why there seems to be an inconsistency in their usage:  </p>

<pre><code>Ventral -&gt; ""belly"" side
Dorsal -&gt; ""back"" side
Anterior -&gt; ""before"" or ""toward the front""
Posterior -&gt; ""after"" or coming after (opposite to) the anterior 
</code></pre>

<p>Based on the body orientation of the organism (often associated with forms of locomotion), these terms can sometimes overlap (as in bipedal humans) but often lie perpendicular to each other (as in quadrupeds, fish and most birds).</p>

  <p>Although the words <em>quadruped</em> and <em>tetrapod</em> are both derived from terms meaning ""four-footed"", they have distinct meanings. A tetrapod is any member of the taxonomic unit <em>Tetrapoda</em> (which is defined by descent from a specific four-limbed ancestor) whereas a quadruped actually <strong>uses four limbs for locomotion</strong>.</p>

<h3> Long Answer </h3>

<p>Think of <strong>ventral</strong> (Latin <em>venter</em> = ""belly"") as being associated with the belly side (with belly referring to ""swelling"" or ""inflating"") -- or typically the side of the organism containing the digestive and respiratory organs. <strong>Dorsal</strong> (from Latin <em>dorsum</em> meaning ""back"") refers to the body region/""side"" opposite that of <em>ventral</em> (and typically called the ""back"").</p>

<p><strong>Anterior</strong> (from Latin <em>ante</em> meaning ""before"" or ""in front of"") refers to the ""front"" of the organism (i.e., the part of the organism you'd encounter 1st or <em>before</em> other body regions). <strong>Posterior</strong> (from Latin, comparative of <em>posterus</em> (""following"") from <em>post-</em> meaning ""after"") is the opposite and refers to the part of the organism encountered ""after"" (or opposite) the <em>anterior</em> side.  </p>

<p>Depending on the orientation of the organism, these terms may be synonymous in some instances but be orthogonal in other instances). </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pxzdg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pxzdg.png"" alt=""Comparing anatomical positional vocabulary""></a></p>

<p>Sometimes anterior/posterior would be synonymous with ventral/dorsal, as is the case in humans or other bipedal organisms. </p>

<p>In other instances (e.g., in quadrupeds, fish or <a href=""http://www.pbase.com/image/140434563"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">birds</a>), posterior/anterior lies relatively orthogonal to the dorsal/ventral orientation. In these cases, dorsal/ventral is instead synonymous with <strong>superior</strong> (from Latin <em>superior</em>, comparative of <em>superus</em> ""that is above,"" from <em>super</em> ""above"") and <strong>inferior</strong> (from Latin <em>inferus</em> meaning ""low"" or ""below""). </p>

<ul>
<li>Often in these cases, anterior/posterior are instead associated with caudal/cranial (common alternatives for cranial  include cephalic or rostral).  <strong>Caudal</strong> (from Latin <em>cauda</em> meaning ""tail"") refers to the tail side of the organism (i.e., the side associated with coccygeal vertebrae or sometimes simply the side of the organism where waste is excreted). Conversely, <strong>cranial</strong> (Greek <em>kranion</em> = ""skull"") or  <strong>cephalic</strong> (from Latin <em>cephalicus</em>, from Greek <em>kephalikos</em>, from <em>kephalē</em> meaning ""head"") refer to the side of the organism containing the head. <strong>Rostral</strong> (referring to <em>rostrum</em> from Latin meaning ""beak"") is another synonym for cranial and refers to being ""situated or occurring near the front end of the body, especially in the region of the nose and mouth or (in an embryo) near the hypophyseal region.""</li>

<pre><code>    P    p

<p>The genotype ratio is <strong>2:2:0</strong> (2 PP : 2 Pp : 0 pp) meaning there are 50% PP and 50% Pp.</p>

<p>The phenotype ratio is <strong>4:0</strong> (4 purple : 0 white) meaning there are 100% purple and 0% white flowers.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, you do not need to reduce the ratio to the lowest terms (in other words, the sum of the numbers in the ratio should equal the number of boxes in the Punnett Square).

"What senses are active while sleeping?","19053","","<p>During sleep, our body activity decreases. I am wondering on the extent of the lowering of this activity regarding our five senses. Clearly, the sense of touch is still very efficient since shaking a body is the most common way to awake someone, and hearing is also quite unaffacted (most, if not all, alarm clock, rely on this sense). Most deaths due to fire are due to intoxication rather than the burnt of the fire, so it suggests that smell and taste are pretty dimmed during sleep. </p>

<p>My main question: <strong>To which extent each sense is dimmed during sleep?</strong></p>

<p>For example, </p>

<ol>
<li>Can we smell during sleep? I don't remember having been awoken by the smell of something during my life...</li>
<li>Similarly, can we taste? If someone gives me delicious food during my sleep, would I be able to feel its taste and remember this experience?</li>
<li>Can we see? REM are well known but it is a mechanical feature of the sleep. Some people sleep with the eyes opened: what do they see?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8361/how-are-our-senses-dimmed-during-sleep"">related question</a> tries to explain <em>how</em> senses are dimmed during sleep but not <em>how much</em> they are.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: I am aware this is person-dependant: any sound would awake my mother (a skill during my nightly escapades) whereas I would not notice a party around me when I am in deep sleep. But there should be some kind of average... It also depends on the phase of sleep; I am mostly interested in deep sleep and REM sleep, but an answer detailing every phase would be awesome. </p>

<p><strong>Note 3</strong>: This question is certainly naive in its current form. Please help me to improve it.</p>
","<p>The answer is of interest not only in sleep but also the perceptions of patients under anesthesia, comatose states, etc.</p>

<p>Our senses aren't 'dimmed' in sleep. There is no effective way to turn off our senses. The best way to explain what happens in sleep is that at some point (the last point, actually), our <em>cognitive processing</em> of sensations changes. That is, our higher brain functions allow us to ignore certain sensory input. This effect has been most studied in sound perception.</p>

<p>In a sleep study involving sound and EEG/fMRI during all phases of (drug-free) sleep,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first significant result of this study is that the pattern of brain activation associated with auditory stimulation was strikingly similar in wakefulness and sleep, suggesting that sensory processing occurred in both conditions. However, we found qualitative differences in brain activation associated with auditory processing during sleep compared to wakefulness. The reduced regional activity during sleep, compared to wakefulness, in the left parietal and, bilaterally, in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus (part of the limbic system) suggests that these areas may be involved in the further processing and perceptual integration of sensory inputs likely to occur during wakefulness only.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Supporting this is evidence that some sounds awaken someone no matter at what stage they are in sleep, for example, young mothers are woken up by their infants' lightest movements<sup>[2]</sup>, and the fact that we respond to our own names in a similar fashion in sleep and in wakefulness, but such responses are not shown for presentation of other first names.<sup>[3]</sup> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These results suggest that the sleeping brain, during SII and PS, elicits a differential cognitive response to the presentation of the subject's own name, comparable to that occurring during wakefulness, and therefore that the sleeping brain is able to detect and categorize some particular aspects of stimulus significance.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
  
  <p>Thus, the results suggest that when subjects were listening to their own name during sleep some brain regions were selectively more responsive than in any other condition. ...we have demonstrated that the sleeping brain is able to process auditory stimuli. In addition, we postulate the existence of a functional network capable of detecting and facilitating processing of emotionally relevant inputs during sleep.<sup>[1]</sup>  </p>
  
  <p>Our results support the view that PS is not a state of ""sensory isolation""; failure to respond to external stimuli during this stage may depend upon mechanisms occurring only after the sensory input has undergone cognitive analysis.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, as you noted, odors are not good at waking people up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some suggest that the human olfactory system during sleep is sufficiently well tuned to ensure arousal to such threatening stimuli as odors associated with smoke from fire. Our results strongly suggest otherwise. The intensity, strength, and noxiousness of the pyridine stimulus elicited behavioral arousal or EEG activation on fewer than half of stage 2 trials, less than one third of REM-sleep trials, and virtually no stage-4- sleep trials. This is a nontrivial lack of response, since pyridine is a component of coal tar and is also used as a herbicide for firewood, and thus is a likely by-product of many real fires. In practical terms, therefore, olfactory awareness in humans is low to absent during sleep, and human olfaction appears insufficiently sensitive and reliable to act as a sentinel system. We further note that auditory arousal threshold is highest in young and sleep-deprived individuals, increasing the likelihood that olfactory processing is even worse for children and sleep-deprived adults.<sup>[5]</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The methodology in the olfactory study varies quite significantly from the auditory study. Better studies may shed more evidence on why olfactory stimuli are processed differently from other stimuli.</p>

<p>As to what percent? That probably differs from person to person, and I did not search the literature for that.</p>

</ul>

<p>Of each hit, I found other hits that claimed the reverse, sometimes with proof. Common sense tells me all mammals can swim, but is this true?</p>
","<p>With respect to the giraffe claim, this article seems relevant:</p>

<p>D. M. Henderson, D. Naish, <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.04.007"">Predicting the buoyancy, equilibrium and potential swimming ability of giraffes by computational analysis</a>, J Theoretical Biology 265 (2010) 151-159.</p>

<p>It cites several non-""random person on the internet"" claims that giraffes cannot swim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is generally thought that giraffes cannot swim, but relevant
  observations are few. Shortridge (1934) and Goodwin (1954) state that
  giraffes were poor waders and unable to swim. Crandall (1964)
  discussed a case where a captive giraffe escaped from a carrying
  crate, ran to the end of a jetty, and fell into the water. The animal
  reportedly sank without making any attempt to swim. MacClintock (1973,
  p. 54) stated ‘Giraffes cannot swim. Rivers are barriers they do not
  cross’. Wood (1982, p. 20) noted that ‘Because of its extraordinarily
  anatomical shape the giraffe is one of the very few mammals that
  cannot swim – even in an emergency! Deep rivers are an impassable
  barrier to them, and they will avoid large expanses of water like the
  plague’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They then go on to show that a model giraffe could plausibly swim, writing: ""For practical and ethical reasons we are unable to use live giraffes...""</p>

<p>They conclude:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In summary, the results and speculations of this study show that it is
  not impossible that a giraffe could propel itself in water, but in
  terms of energy efficiency relative to that of the horse, it would
  appear that the costs of aquatic locomotion might be too high. It is
  reasonable to expect that giraffes would be hesitant to enter water
  knowing that they would be at a decided disadvantage compared to being
  on solid ground.</p>

"How and why did mammals go back to the oceans?","18821","","<p>If I understand evolutionary biology correctly, mammals first evolved on land as small, rodent-like creatures, in a time when reptiles were dominant on land. Eventually, they diversified into the species we know today. Some of these species, however, are aquatic - whales and dolphins readily spring to mind. Why did the ancestors of whales and dolphins leave the land to go to the oceans? How did they evolve from their original form to their superficially ichthyoid appearance today?</p>
","<p>I'll focus on whales and dolphins (cetaceans) as you mention them by name and they are representative for other marine mammals such as seals or manatees. The evolution of cetaceans was one of the fascinating evolutionary mysteries. Clearly, they were mammals, but which mammals were their closest relatives? Clues to solve this mystery began to appear in the 1980s and 1990s. </p>

<p>During the 1980s and into the 1990s, paleontologists discovered several fossils that were clearly land-based mammals but shared many skeletal features with cetaceans. These fossils, including <em>Pakicetus</em> [(Gingerich et al. 1983)] and <em>Rodhocetus</em> <a href=""http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/62571/368844a0.pdf?sequence=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Gingerich et al. 1994)</a>, shared skeletal features that are unique to whales and to the <a href=""http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/artio/artiodactyla.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Artiodactyla</a>, commonly known as the even-toed mammals. Artiodactyls includes deer, sheep, pigs, bison, and hippopotamuses. Artiodactyls and the fossil whales share a unique skeletal feature of the ankle called an astrogalus, shown in the picture below. The astragalus is a ""double pulley"" structure that contributes to the ankle joint. This picture is taken from an excellent summary of whale evolution, provided by the <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_03"" rel=""noreferrer"">Understanding Evolution</a> site hosted by University of California at Berkeley. The astragalus is not present in other mammals.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2dvlm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The fossil whales and modern cetaceans also share unique features of the skull around the area of the ear, called a tympanic bulla. Although all mammals have bullae (plural of bulla), the bullae of cetaceans and the whale fossils is unique compared to other mammals. For more on the bulla, see this <a href=""http://www.talkorigins.org/features/whales/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Talk Origins page</a>. More on fossil whales can be found at the <a href=""http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/cetacea/cetacean.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Berkeley Comparative Museum of Paleontology</a>. The many fossils that have been found are <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/lines_03"" rel=""noreferrer"">transitional forms</a> that link artiodactyls and modern cetaceans.</p>

<p>Around the same time as the fossil discoveries, genetic analysis added additional evidence supporting a relationship between the artiodactyls and cetaceans <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/30018105_Revised_phylogeny_of_whales_suggested_by_mitochondrial_ribosomal_DNA_sequences/file/79e41509811cc6ad26.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Milinkovitch et al. 1993)</a>. Although early genetic analytical techniques were not as robust as they are today, many genetic studies have since supported and refined the conclusions of Milinkovitch et al. Current evidence shows that the closest <em>living</em> relative of cetaceans are the hippos (see, for example <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/7665216_A_complete_phylogeny_of_the_whales_dolphins_and_even-toed_hoofed_mammals_(Cetartiodactyla)/file/3deec521e33865a8e0.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Price et al. 2005</a> and <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/5262443_The_phylogeny_of_Cetartiodactyla_the_importance_of_dense_taxon_sampling_missing_data_and_the_remarkable_promise_of_cytochrome_b_to_provide_reliable_species-level_phylogenies/file/60b7d518fb5d130590.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Agnarsson and May-Collado 2008</a>). The relationships are shown below in this figure from the Agnarsson and May-Collado paper. The dark lines are the artiodactyls and cetaceans, formally called the Cetartiodactyla.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qOk2R.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The question remains: why? The most likely explanation is that cetaceans evolved to exploit an unfilled <a href=""http://www.learner.org/courses/envsci/unit/text.php?unit=4&amp;secNum=7"" rel=""noreferrer"">ecological niche</a> or adapted to new niches that formed as a result of plate tectonics or other types of environmental changes that occurred <a href=""http://www.scotese.com/newpage9.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">50-55 million years ago</a>. The niche describes all of the living and non-living resources needed by an organism to survive. Although land-based mammals were increasing in diversity, few or none were present in the oceans. The basic hypothesis is that the early whale-like artiodactyls, like <em>Indohyus</em> and <em>Pakicetus</em> were land-based (terrestrial) mammals that spent most of their time near the water's edge. Over time, they adapted to the niches in the ocean. Fossils like <em>Ambulcetus</em> and <em>Rodhocetus</em> showed clear <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_03"" rel=""noreferrer"">evidence of swimming ability</a>, with flattened tails and the enlarged rear feet. In addition, the nostrils shifted from the front of the face to the top of the head, which we recognize as the blowhole. </p>

<p>The shift to the aquatic habitat allowed these species to exploit resources that were not available to land-based mammals, thereby reducing <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/species-interactions-and-competition-102131429"" rel=""noreferrer"">competition</a> for the resources. Reduced competition allows more individuals to survive and reproduce.</p>

<p>Similar scenarios are very likely for other marine mammals, such as seals or manatees. They evolved to take advantage of ecological niches that were not filled by other organisms. This basic concept, evolving to fill available niches, is a common outcome of the evolutionary process. </p>

<p>The of adaptation of cetaceans and other mammals to the oceans may be similar to that of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus"" rel=""noreferrer"">hippopotamus</a>. Hippos spend most of their time in the water, and they show many adaptations that allow them to live in the aquatic environment.  The eyes and nostrils of the hippo are high on the head, which allows them to remain almost entirely submerged but still see and smell, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pAWv9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
(Hippo photo by <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/johanneslundberg/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Johannes Lunberg</a>, Flickr Creative Commons.)</p>

<p>Hippos feed underwaters, they are heavy enough to walk on the bottom of the river, and the mate and give birth underwater. The young can suckle underwater. Clearly, hippos seem to be another mammal that is ""returning to water."" Similar types of processes must have occurred in cetaceans for them to adapt to the marine habitat. </p>

<p>Do nails, skin and hair must be trapped in Vermiform appendix?</p>
","<p>Skin is safe to chew, and digestible. Fingernails are not digestible, so really shouldn't be swallowed if avoidable. In the medical literature, there are at least 225 cases of foreign bodies in the appendix. They include:</p>

"What is the importance of hydrogen bonds in water? and other questions:","18735","","<p>These are extremely simple questions — basic biology — but I would like to make sure that the way I have answered is at the very least correct. </p>

<ol>
<li>Hydrogen bonds are very weak, so how is it possible that they are so important in the properties of water? <em>Hydrogen bonds in water provide many characteristic benefits to water: cohesion (holding water molecules together), high specific heat (absorbing heat when breaking, releasing heat when forming; minimizing temperature change), high heat of vaporization (several hydrogen bonds must be broken in order to evaporate water), lower density of ice (molecules in ice are spaced farther apart), and solubility (polar molecules are attracted to ions and polar compounds, making them soluble in water).</em>  </li>
<li>Why do we feel cooler immediately after we go swimming than we do after we have fully dried off? <em>We feel cooler immediately after we go swimming than we do after we have dried off because it takes a lot of heat to evaporate water; however, once we dry off we remove much of the water from our skin, and the water is evaporated much more quickly.</em> </li>
<li>If water were non-polar, would our temperature heat up less quickly or more quickly if we went outside on a hot day? Why? More quickly. <em>Because hydrogen bonds within water slow down the movement of molecules and allow for water to have a very high specific heat.</em> </li>
</ol>
","<ol>
<li>You are saying what hydrogen bonds are doing, not why are they able of such achievements, despite being so weak. Their strength is in numbers. At room temperature, fully one fifth of the water molecules are engaged in four bonds with other water molecules, while the remainder forms two such bonds. (More detail at <a href=""http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hbond.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hbond.html</a> ). In contrast, hydrogen sulfide forms essentially no hydrogen bonds with other hydrogen sulfide molecules, despite significant similarity between oxygen and sulfide. The difference in size between oxygen and sulfur makes the former much more electronegative. I could go on with other hydrogen compounds, but the fact that answers your first question is: each water molecule is involved in a series of bonds with other water molecules, on an unequaled scale.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, hydrogen bonds are stronger, pickier about distance and angle than the alternatives available to other molecules (dipole-dipole, van der Waals etc.) So even if they seem feeble, and even if the alternatives were as plentiful as hydrogen bonds, the latter would still be more capable of tying up molecules.</p>

<ol>
<li>The effect of water drying (which comes after swimming, but also after sweating, bathing, or cleaning oneself with a hot oshibori) is caused by water evaporation. Each state transition, including that from liquid water to air-borne vapors, is a heat-consuming phenomenon. When skin dries, the heat to turn water into vapors has to come from somewhere. In perspiration's case, it is one's body.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that cooling down while water evaporates is not only something we feel, but a physical reality, occurring even in innate systems. For example, Amazon forests and Sahara are similarly close to the Equator, but the former is cooler than the latter, in part because heat it receives is in part used up to evaporate water.</p>

<p>Your answer was good.</p>

<ol>
<li>Again, you are right. Were water non-polar, it would have lower latent heat, or, in lay terms, it would evaporate without much heat consumption. Were sweat made of a non-polar liquid, it will fail to consume heat when evaporating, leaving one to warm up sooner / faster.</li>

Since charges need to be balanced (so that there are no charges building up somewhere), what is the positive charge which neutralizes this negative charge?</p>
","<p>DNA in the body is not available as a free molecule, it is organized around DNA binding proteins, mostly the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_octamer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">histone octamers</a>. These proteins carry positive charges (mostly from lysine side chains) which interact with the phosphate backbone of the DNA. It is like in the figure below, the charges play an important role in the tight packaging. See <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2313700"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for more details.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HvhF1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The charge (or the temporary neutralization at some points of the DNA) is also important for the regulation of the DNA. Acetylation neutralizes the histone tail and loosens the DNA-protein structure (see <a href=""http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/12/5/599"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for more information).</p>

<p>Positively charged ions don't play a role in neutralizing the DNA charge in living cells (this is different for precipitations), as both are solubilized and split into ions. The concentration of positively charged ions like sodium and potassium are tightly controlled by the cells, as they are important for the function of transporters (for example the sodium-glucose transporters and others) or for keeping up membrane potentials. Moving the ions, which have to neutralize the DNA charge around would lead to a polarized nucleus.</p>

<p>Of course, the exact amounts will vary from person to person and based on how deeply the person is breathing, lung health, etc.  I'm just looking for a ballpark figure.</p>

"What causes fingerprints to form and why is the pattern formed unique?","18319","","<p>I've found research that suggests that the reason we develop fingerprints is because they aid us with feeling surfaces (<a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5920/1503.abstract"">Scheibert, <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>) and not to increase friction  and help with the gripping of smooth objects (<a href=""http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/13/i.1.short"">Warman and Ennos 2009</a>).</p>

<p>One thing I am still curious about is at what stage of growth the pattern is formed and why a unique pattern is created in the fingerprint of each person (including identical twins). I assume it has something to do with the mechanism by which the patterns form, but I couldn't find any detailed research into this. Any insight would be very welcome.</p>
","<p>I would say genetic diversity is the primary reason which results in other reasons that you are looking for. At the lowest level, random crossing over at prophase I, random separation of homologous chromosomes at anaphase I, random separation of sister chromatids at anaphase II, and random fertilization: one sperm fertilizes one egg randomly. </p>

<p>The skin is developed from ectoderm so need to look at the formation of embryonic disc and specifically to the <a href=""http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/hdisqueembry/triderm02.html"">genesis of germ layers</a>: ectoderm.</p>

<p>However, I would stick to the primary reasons, since it is extremely difficult to visualize the given formation - actually we do not have resources for it at the moment.</p>

<hr>

<p>Very good question the last part. I have an intuition that skin develops randomly because of the above reasons. You would also need a lot of memory to make identical skins for twins! It has not been useful to have identical fingerprints between two people so evolution has not resulted into it.</p>

<p>Feeling surfaces and gripping are movements - not much space taken things, in contrast to the memory needed in storing the exact surfaces of skin from one generation to another. - Learning is a way to save resources here and it is a lot more efficient and than storing static information to species from one generation to another.</p>

","<p><strong>1 billion hives</strong>
(at 10,000-50,000 bees/hive this is 10-50 trillion bees)</p>

<p><strong>Managed: 100 million hives</strong></p>

<p>Based on country-level <a href=""http://faostat.fao.org/"">data from FAO</a>, supplemented  for a few countries with <a href=""http://www.beekeeping.org/"">Apiservices</a>, in 2011 there were about 80 million managed hives. Because FAO lacks any data for some countries, and other countries under-report (for instance US figures don't include hives kept for pollination service and hives kept by small-scale operators) a reasonable round estimate of managed hives in the world is 100 million. (This implies a 128% correction to the FAO numbers). (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.071"">Aizen and Harder 2009</a> give context on FAO figures).</p>

<p><strong>Wild/Feral: 900 million hives</strong></p>

<p>Wild/feral hives of <em>Apis mellifera</em> are difficult to count via direct observation. <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01331.x"">Jaffe et al 2010</a> use a genetic sampling method, and also report a reasonably strong correlation between the total number of hives (managed and wild) per square kilometer and the mean annual temperature of the area.
I used the best fit line from their data to estimate the ""hive-carrying-capacity"" by country using (the admittedly very general) <a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.TOTL.K2"">land area</a> and <a href=""http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/~timm/cty/obs/TYN_CY_1_1.html"">mean annual temperature</a>. Then I subtracted the number of managed hives from the carrying capacity to estimate wild hives.</p>

<p>Although this formula probably overestimates large, cold countries and underestimates Africa (the formula gives 211 million feral hives in Africa when literature suggests closer to 300 million), in general, it seems to give not unreasonable estimates in comparison to the literature. Globally, this formula gives an estimate of 984 million wild hives. Given that land area included desert and other unsuitable habitat, it seemed reasonable to round down, and I took 900 million as my estimate.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Populations</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KuyLe.jpg"" alt=""Hives of *Apis mellifera* over time.""></p>

<p><strong>1961-2011</strong> 
FAO statistics date to 1961. I plotted their numbers, with the 128% correction for each year. I assumed that during this time the number of wild bees has remained virtually unchanged, at 900 million, because it was defined by mean temperature and land area, which have not changed.*</p>

<p><strong>1650-1961</strong>
This period represents the globalization of <em>Apis mellifera</em>. Before 1600, there were no European honey bees beyond their native range (Western Eurasia and Africa). However, once established in new areas (the usually cited first beehive in the USA in 1622), <em>Apis mellifera</em> rapidly spread in both managed and feral populations, in North America (17th c), South America (18th c), Australia (19th c) and East Asia (20th c) <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=ANTSvKj1AZEC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">(Crane 1999)</a>
.</p>

<p>I used carrying capacity of native range countries (just about 35% of the carrying capacity of the globe, or 350 million hives) as a before-1650 estimate,  and then assumed a geometric increase of about 2% per decade in available land area (ALA), as <em>Apis mellifera</em> bees and beekeeping made their way around the globe.</p>

<p>To estimate the number of managed bees during this period, I assumed a human:hive ratio of 35:1**, and modelled hives based on historical estimates of human population, multiplied by the ALA for the decade. The 1650 estimate was 5 million managed hives.</p>

<hr>

<p>*Although diseases, pests, and pesticides have been reported to affect feral populations, I didn't find any solid information on this. For instance, feral populations of <em>Apis mellifera mellifera</em> and <em>A. m ligustica</em> have been widely reported to be in decline in the USA, but at the same time, feral populations of Africanized honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera</em> hybrids) have been rapidly spreading. Even with 90% losses in the USA, Canada, Japan, and Europe (areas affected by varroa) my estimates would only be decreased about 10%. However, it's also possible that land-use change has greatly affected feral bee populations <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-006-9054-5"">(Moritz et al 2007)</a>.</p>

<p>**This wasn't a totally wild guess. I first calculated the human:hive ratio for 1961-2011. This ratio was increasing - there were 71 people / hive in 2011, and 47 in 1961. Initially, I assumed the rate of change in the ratio to be constant, but this led to unrealistically large estimates for historically managed hives. However, the rate was clearly increasing (just, perhaps in a nonlinear way I didn't want to estimate), so I decided instead to compromise on a number less than 47 and greater than 4. I decided on 35, as it produced what seemed like a realistic estimate of 5 million hives in 1650, compared to around 20 million today for Eurasia and North Africa (excluding sub-saharan Africa where wild-harvest remains important and likely was even more so in the past).</p>

<p>Chemokines are molecules that drive cellular chemotaxis. That means they make cells move towards a desired place. Generally chemokines refer to immune cells and there's loads and loads of them. </p>

<p>Interleukins are anything which are messenger molecules between immune cells (inter- means between and -leukins means leukocytes/white blood cells). They're typically denoted by IL + number. However the interferon and tumour necrosis families come under interleukins too in most people's opinion. The interferons are a special group that typically inhibit viruses by making cells non-permissible to viral replication. They also do a few other things like activate macrophages or promote Th1 response, which both also interfere with viruses but there is bacterial overlap. The TNF family is a bit weirder as some are interleukin-like but others aren't as much. TNF-alpha (the classic one) is involved in macrophage maturation. However not all interleukins are strictly between white blood cells, as IL1 acts on the hypothalamus among other leukocytes. </p>

<p>Let's assume that we don't add NaCl. Will the CTAB create complex with DNA or not? As I read CTAB creates ionic bonds with DNA (phosphate groups). So in this situation (without NaCl) CTAB must be able to create complex with DNA too.</p>

<p>So why did we use NaCl? Just to keep proteins and other hydrocarbons soluble in the water or there is something else that NaCl helps in this complex creation?</p>
","<p>CTAB forms insoluble complexes with nucleic acids and can be used to selectively precipitate them from solutions, see this reference: </p>

"What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis?","17985","","<p>Hello my Professor has been teaching about apoptosis and sometimes makes the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic. I am not sure if I know for sure what this means. Does this just refer to intrinsic is a cell doing itself while extrinsic refers to Fas ligand? Thanks.</p>
","<p>In both pathways 'the cell does itself' the difference is in the reason.</p>

<p>In short:
Intrinsic apoptosis is a response to 'internal damage' eg. damaged DNA, chromosom rearrangement, hang ups in division, hypoxia, etc. that the cell senses itself and 'decides to commit suicide'. This is done by the mitochondrial pathway - release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria activates the caspase cascade that results in programmed cell death. This is like ""I'm too damaged, I must die"".</p>

<p>In the extrinsic pathway as you have mentioned is indeed related to the FAS ligand (and Fas/FasL being the main pathway for apoptosis), but that is not the only external signal as TNF (also known as TNA-alpha) binding to TNF-R1 (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) may also lead to apoptosis. These pathways are usually activated by the immune system for example in cellular immune response. This is like ""You're abnormal / dangerous / infected, you must die"".</p>

<p>Both pathways activates the caspase cascade at some point that results in apoptosis. Either way the actual process of apoptosis is carried out by the cell itself in a programmed, regulated manner.</p>

<p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis</a>
This papaer offers a great review on the topic, including both pathways:
<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2117903/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2117903/</a></p>

<p>I'd like to quote few  important parts to support my answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The extrinsic, intrinsic, and granzyme B pathways converge on the same terminal, or execution pathway. This pathway is initiated by the cleavage of caspase-3 and results in DNA fragmentation, degradation of cytoskeletal and nuclear proteins, cross-linking of proteins, formation of apoptotic bodies, expression of ligands for phagocytic cell receptors and finally uptake by phagocytic cells. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(...)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The extrinsic signaling pathways that initiate apoptosis involve transmembrane receptor-mediated interactions. These involve death receptors that are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor gene superfamily</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The intrinsic signaling pathways that initiate apoptosis involve a diverse array of non-receptor-mediated stimuli that produce intracellular signals that act directly on targets within the cell and are mitochondrial-initiated events. </p>

"Arm at Heart Level when Measuring Blood Pressure","17861","","<p>How come that one's arm has to be at heart level so that the blood pressure can be measured accurately. I've tried researching this question, but most answers to it were just ""if the arm is above the heart level the blood pressure is too high and vise versa,"" but I want to know why this is so.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://electron6.phys.utk.edu/101/CH5/pumps.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">This page</a> (and many others) explain the idea rather well. This is more of a physics than a biology question, but the fundamental concepts are the same. </p>

<p>In fact, contrary to what you wrote in the question, the measured blood pressure should be lower than expected if the arm is elevated above heart level. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XhO3W.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>When you reduce the pressure on the bent pipe, the water level on the side where the pressure is reduced rises. </p>

<p>Similarly, When the arm is elevated, it is equivalent to the right hand side of the image, where the right hand tube's water level is higher than the left hand side. Raising the arm above heart level, with the pressure of blood at the heart level remaining constant, will result in a lower pressure being measured, due to the heart effectively having to pump the blood up the distance. </p>

<p>For the same reason, <a href=""http://www.giraffeconservation.org/giraffe_facts.php?pgid=4"" rel=""noreferrer"">giraffes have very high blood pressures</a> (double that of humans) due to their long necks.

"Laying eggs vs giving birth: is there a connection with internal vs. external ears?","17842","","<p>I have heard that ""The animals who have their 'EARS' outside their body give birth to their young ones and the animals who have their 'EARS' inside their body lay eggs."" Is this true? Are there counterexamples?</p>
","<p>Just to expand on @rg255's very good answer, you could make the same sort of claim using just about any characteristic that is more commonly found in mammals. </p>

<p>Giving birth to live young is a characteristic of most (see the platypus below), if not all, mammals. Therefore, you could make the statement about external ears (also more common to mammals) using any other mammal specific body plan. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The animals who have their 'TESTICLES' outside their body give birth to their young ones and the animals who have their 'TESTICLES' inside their body lay eggs.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am pretty sure you will find that this is as true as the statement about ears. </p>

<p>As in all other debates about this kind of thing, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">platypus</a> comes along and complicates things. This beastie has no external ears (or external testicles for that matter), it has tiny ear slits instead and it lays eggs. So, even this extreme weirdo seems to follow the ears (or testicles) on the inside means eggs rule. However, it is a mammal, it produces milk that it will feed to its newly hatched young like all mammals (well, almost, it doesn't have teats and instead the young suck up their mother's milk through her spongy belly).</p>

<p>A more straightforward and well known example that directly contradicts the ears claim is the dolphin. Dolphin ears are small holes on the sides of their heads but they give birth to live young as do all sea mammals. In fact, I am pretty sure that all sea mammals lack external ears (and cetaceans at least also lack external testicles) but give birth to live young. So seals, sea lions, walruses etc also contradict the ears rule.</p>

<p>In conclusion, no it is not true that all animals with internal ears lay eggs.</p>

"Can humans survive without consuming life?","17669","","<p>Some people say that it's awful that humans eat animals.  They feel that it's barbaric, because you're killing life and then on top of that, you're eating it, and that you should eat vegetation instead.</p>

<p>But isn't vegetation life too?  Personally, I see no difference between animals and veg as all life has cells, dna etc</p>

<p>So my question is, is it possible for humans to live healthy long lives without eating any type of life, i.e no animals, no plants, no cells (dead or alive) etc? If it is possible, how would it be done?</p>
","<p>The answer to your question is <strong>yes</strong> it is certainly possible. </p>

<p>At one time it was thought that there was something special about ""organic"" chemicals which meant that they could not be artificially synthesised out of fundamental elements. In 1828 Frederick Wöhler synthesised urea (CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) which is often taken as the first demonstration that the organic v inorganic distinction was not a sound one (for more on this see the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6hler_synthesis"">Wikipedia article on Wöhler synthesis</a>.</p>

<p>As far as we know all essential human nutrients can be synthesised from inorganic ingredients, even complex molecules such as Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.</p>

<p>Other contributors have pointed out that organic pathways for synthesising our food have evolved over long periods to be very efficient - at least in the conditions prevailing on Earth. You haven't ruled out copying biochemical pathways using chemicals that are entirely of inorganic origin. Anyone trying to do this seriously could create glucose (for example) by artificially creating enzymes (perhaps via artificial DNA) to do the job. The thing is that we already have self-replicating and repairing machines to do that already (plants).</p>

<p>There might be circumstances when we needed to use artificial synthesis. I can think of two science-fiction stories that deal with this question, the first of which goes into some detail:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_Hell!"">The Moon is Hell</a> by John W. Campbell, in which astronauts are stranded on the moon and forced to make food from what they find there.</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Error"">Technical Error</a> by Arthur C. Clarke, in which a man is accidentally rotated through the fourth dimension. His employers contemplate the difficulty caused by the ""handedness"" of many biological molecules meaning they would have to artificially synthesise many of his foods.</li>
</ul>

<p>It may be that a future expedition to Mars (say) might have to think about these things.</p>

<p>A little searching fails to come up with standard inorganic syntheses of glucose and similar substances. The reason for this is almost certainly because it is so easy to use organic inputs. Glucose is easily made by the hydrolysis of starch. Starch is very common and cheap. Even l-glucose is usually made out of organically derived precursors (or sometimes even using d-glucose).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: sources etc</strong>
One problematic question is: where do you get your input for making nutrients? As others have pointed out, exactly where to draw the line is difficult. </p>

<p>This problem starts in defining what is alive in the first place. Do you count viruses (which can go down to a few thousand base pairs of RNA) or satellite viruses (STobRV has only 359 base pairs) or prions? In a sense these are ""just"" very large molecules. But then really simple bacteria are not many orders of magnitude more complex. As an aside most systems of ethics that do not permit eating meat do not make an alive/non-alive distinction, choosing some other aspect such as sentience, though Jainism comes close to doing so.</p>

<p>The second problem is, if we reject living things as sources of food, how far removed from those living things are we allowed to get? You say no cells in any state including ""dead"". That would exclude (say) fruit even though most fruits are expressly created by plants in order to be eaten (and in some cases must be eaten) - something that vegans, jains, fruitarians and others would be happy with eating. If we could use dead material things would be much easier.</p>

<p>But would you also include hydrocarbons (coal, oil, gas) which were once living organisms? If you do, then you are in difficulty because terrestrial carbon is recycled through the biosphere. All CO2 was (to a close approximation) once a part of a living thing. If you take that position then of course you are going to have to go off-planet to find your source chemicals and your problem becomes very much harder.</p>

<p>I was assuming that you were restricting yourself to consuming cells that retain some of their cell structure but had not completely degraded. If that is where you draw the line then there are ample sources of raw materials on earth.</p>

<p>Genetic modification is much more science fiction though not entirely impossible. Some nutrients could be made by humans without much difficulty. Our inability to manufacture vitamin C is down to one missing enzyme (L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase) which is present in most vertebrates (I think of mammals only guinea pigs, humans and some bats are unable to synthesise it). You could certainly imagine some very careful genetic modification changing humans so they no longer need to consume vitamin C.</p>

<p>But photosynthesis would be much harder. Chloroplasts (which do the job in most plants) are really a very primitive form of life living in plant cells which may independently reproduce  (and for that reason might be excluded by you - they aren't ""cells"" but they have membranes). They could easily end up in conflict with our mitochondria (since intracellular conflict between organelles is possible) and you would need to do enormous amounts of work to make human cells co-operate with them properly.</p>

<p>More in keeping with your theme would be adding photosynthetic systems directly to human cells along with a suite of enzymes to manufacture all the things we cannot. That is of course in principle scientifically possible (since plants do it) but much harder than it looks. Living systems are very complicated and small changes can have unexpected consequences. Even very minor genetic modifications are problematic. The human autotroph is likely to be some way off.</p>

","<p>You can't catch conjunctivitis by looking at someone, but you can spread it around by touching your eye and touching something else, which then can pass the virus to someone else (viral conjunctivitis can be highly contagious). There are no hard facts, but one estimate is that people touch their faces an average of 3.6 times per hour, more if your eyes are itchy. Wearing sunglasses can not only help the possibly increased sensitivity of eyes with conjunctivitis, but they may also cut down on the number of times you touch your eye (thus spreading the virus).</p>

"How do trees use Adhesion and Cohesion to move water against gravity?","17399","","<p>I have an AP Bio class where I have to name 3 properties of water and I chose adhesion and cohesion for one of them. I'm having trouble finding out how exactly trees use adhesion and cohesion to move water. There is a lot of different answers out there on the net. How do trees use adhesion and cohesion to move water against gravity?</p>
","<p>In high school, we did an experiment that showed this.</p>

<p>Basically, if you take a glass of water, and let it sit out, perhaps in front of an open window, it will eventually lose water due to evaporation. It may take a few days/weeks to really see a large difference, but the level will go down. But, if you take a few flexible straws, put them in so the bendy part is submerged, the water level will drop much more quickly. (I'm not exactly sure if the bendy straw part is really that important here. Logically, I don't think it is, but I haven't done the experiment so I can't really say.)</p>

<p>The reason the straws cause evaporation to happen more quickly is because as wind blows across the top of the straws, it pulls some of the water with it. And because, as the last person said, of cohesion and adhesion, the column of water is pulled up with it and thus it evaporates faster.</p>

<p>Similarly, these fluid mechanics are why toilets and siphoning work. When you siphon, you create a low pressure area inside the tube, like you are sucking out of a straw. Because of this low pressure, liquid is pulled into the tube. If you fill the tube with liquid, and turn the tube down toward the ground so the liquid starts coming out the end, the force of the liquid coming out of the tube creates low pressure in the tube again, thus causing more liquid to be sucked up.</p>

<p>This is very similar to how trees work. In the stomata, or the pores in the leaves that allow the leaves to ""breathe,"" wind helps to pull the water out of the pores. But because of the decrease in pressure cause by the liquid being sucked out of the pore, water gets pulled up the tubes in the tree (xylem).</p>

"What does irregular heartbeat mean in simple language?","17374","","<p>I bought a blood pressure monitor (A&amp;D UA-851) which has the option to measure irregular heartbeat.  I do understand what 'irregular' means, but why do irregular heartbeats happen and what are it's implications short and long term? </p>
","<p>There are many parts in the OP's question. 
One is about indications. 
However, since the device of question is subjective in determining irregular heartbeats or heart rhythms, it provides only <strong>subjective</strong> results, particularly about irregular heartbeats and irregular heartrhythms. 
I focus on my answer why it does so and how it could be designed better for objective results. </p>

<p>Listing indications based on subjective measurements have high risk of false negative and false positive results. 
Also, the other fact is that since we do not know what does the irregular heartbeat really looks like, I think, it is too early to provide indications and can be very error-prone.</p>

<h2>Definition of Heartbeat</h2>

<p>Heartbeat has amplitude and characteristic energy levels in time. 
One unit of the Cardiac rhythm is the pulse wave or in other words heartbeat. 
The amplitude and time interval of the pulse wave can be palpated, not only either one, subjectively by hand. </p>

<p>Limitations about detecting irregular heartbeats with subjective blood pressure devices</p>

<ul>
<li>You cannot return energy spectrum of heartbeat from cardiac rhythm and time interval as two separate units. 
In other words, you cannot return the blood pressure with little errors this way, only very rough approximation.
Therefore, I skip the description of the cardiac rhythm which is not heartbeat. 
See the <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/27472/86"">Rags' answer</a> for his simplistic and wrong definition of the irregular heartbeat as an irregular cardiac rhythm where he also skips sporadic type - better in the book (1) for the full descriptions. </li>
<li>I skip the physiology of cardiac cycle here for simplicity because it is not needed for explicit definition of heartbeat, but can be used for implicit definition from one-sided and  wrong view as in <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/19306/86"">Tivie's answer</a>. 
You can see in one answer of revision history where I describe how to define little more explicitly the cardiac cycle with seven distinct phases but not relevant to this answer so left out.</li>
<li>The blood pressure machines are not for detecting irregular heartbeats like in Rags' biased comment <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/27472/86"">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>One heartbeat can consists of many energy levels from different origins. 
However, there are often characteristic energy levels with greatest energy in the normal heartbeat.</p>

<h2>Irregular heartbeat</h2>

<p>Irregular heartbeat has irregularities in energy level and time interval. 
In contrast, cardiac rhythm can have irregularities only in time interval, which is the reason why we do not look the case here from the view.</p>

<h2>Irregular heartbeat for the blood pressure monitor -machine</h2>

<p>I now describe how the heartbeat is detected simplistically and giving you an overview about how these machines work. </p>

<p>The blood pressure monitors detect first the amplitudes of the heartbeat in time interval. 
They convert the data into different energy levels and do analysis based on both energy level and time interval. </p>

<p>Irregular heartbeats form from the Pacemaker cells (SA node, AV node and Purkinje fibers) which maintain the cardiac rhythm and the energy of the heartbeat. 
They can be arrythmic (rarely benign) or tachycardic.</p>

<p>Each machine is designed little differently but they have some components the same. 
They are designed for the normal physiologic condition at rest, not often for different pathologies, arrhythmias, tachycardia, fast respiration, temporary diseases and accelerative movements.
They try to skip some major distractions in doing the calculation. 
I skip the specific algorithms in doing these simplifications and approximations, see the revision history for a stub about this topic. </p>

<p>The blood pressure monitors detect arterial blood pressure, do analysis based on it and its applications, and estimates blood pressure. 
Good machines use the characteristic energy levels and time interval together in analysis. 
The characteristic energy levels can be differentiated to the origin, since we know which frequency corresponds to each pacemaker:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sinoatrial node (70-80 Hz)</li>
<li>AV node beating too early (40-55 Hz)</li>
<li>Bundle of His (40 Hz)</li>
<li>Purkinje fibers (15-40 Hz)</li>
</ul>

<p>The good machine has to be able to distinguish between pulse (P) and respiratory waves (R). 
It ignores most often the vasomotor wave (V) because the interval of measurement is so short. 
See the Figure for those waves in one picture:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9PlzY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>where the vasomotor wave can be deduced by trendline or appropriate time-series analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>. 
Good blood pressure monitoring machines estimate the blood pressure of the heartbeat  through the characteristic energy levels in time interval. 
The analysis and diagnosis of the irregular heartbeat is however much more difficult. My skipped factors and many others should be considered if such a device is wanted. </p>

"Why is dimethyltryptamine (DMT) being released during death?","17370","","<p>I'm not very well informed about all the things related to biology and the current achievements of science in this field so if I'm wrong in anything I say, please let me know. </p>

<p>Many times I've come across a theory that the meaning of life itself is procreation - we simply live in order to make our species exist as long as possible. In the light of this theory, units like homosexuals or infertile people are totally useless and there's no really reason for them to exist from biological point of view. Though it's pretty obvious that in order to make us want to reproduce, something like joy of having sexual intercourse and life in general has been created. That's why units who only lack in ability to reproduce do live and most of the time they're fine.</p>

<p>Evolution doing adjustments in us in order to make us feel happy during our life seems to be understandable, but what about death? I've read that during death, a larger amount of DMT substance is being released in the brain - compound which is known from it's psychedelic effects, which in most cases are euphoric. It looks like we're not meant to feel 'bad' while dying, which is nice, but my question is - is it known why? What could be the evolutionary reason to create this mechanism? The unit which is about to die is not going to be useful anymore, so why bother? I'd like to somehow understand logic behind this. </p>
","<p>The issue I suspect you are struggling with is the anthropomorphization of the evolutionary process.  Evolution is an optimization process driven by random mechanisms...i.e. there is often not a ""reason"" for why certain things are the way they are.  Evolution is not a conscious ""designer"" that produces things with a specific goal in mind...it simply ""picks"" the best random alteration and enhances it.  If there is no ""best mutation"", then there is no selection pressure to drive change overtime.</p>

<p>For example, one can ask, ""Why do humans have 5 fingers on each hand, instead of 6 or 4?""  There is no answer, because the question itself is nonsensical.  Humans have 5 fingers simply because there is no pressure to drive a change to 6 or fingers, and so it boils down to randomness.  There is no ""reason"" humans have 2 arms, as opposed to 4.  That particular trait just randomly happened to be the one which became dominant.</p>

<p>So, to return to your question of ""Why does the brain release DMT when dying?"", the answer is that there IS no answer.  There is no selection pressure for or against that trait, it just happens.  As to the mechanism itself, I suspect that there is just a global breakdown of function in the brain, leading to a dump of ALL neurotransmitters.  When the reuptake pumps fail, the neurons just dump their contents into the extracellular space.  The result is pleasant hallucinations, giving the impression that humans are not ""meant"" to feel pain when dying.  Imposing that kind of rationale, however, is simply creating meaning out of chaos.  If you watch TV static long enough, your mind will start to see patterns which aren't there, simply because the human mind is ""wired"" to find patterns in chaos in order to better understand the environment.</p>

<p>To wrap this up, I suppose the answer to your question is that the brain is finding meaning in meaninglessness, simply because that is what the brain does.  We look for patterns to make sense out of our environment, which sometimes leads to spurious conclusions.  There is no reason that the brain hallucinates when dying, but there IS a reason that this trait appears to be a built-in mechanism.</p>

<p>I hope I was able to shed some light on the issue.  Or at the very least, not confuse you further :D</p>

"Why do adults lose hearing at high frequencies?","17268","","<p>Children and teens can hear high pitched sounds that adults can't hear anymore. Why do adults lose high-frequency hearing?</p>
","<p>Hearing declines with age and, typically, high frequencies are affected first. <strong>Age-related hearing loss</strong> (or <strong><em>presbyacusis</em></strong> (<a href=""http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/7/2115.full.pdf+html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kujawa &amp; Liberman, 2006</a>)) is progressive and starts at the highest frequencies and as a person ages the lower frequencies are affected. The reduction in hearing sensitivity is caused by the <strong>loss of hair cells</strong>. Hair cells are sensory cells in the inner ear that convert acoustic vibrations into electrical signals. These signals are transmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve.  </p>

<p>Because of the <strong>tonotopic organization</strong> of the inner ear (the <em>cochlea</em>) one can conclude that presbyacusis develops from the basal to apical region. The following schematic of the cochlea from <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/media/537/The-analysis-of-sound-frequencies-by-the-basilar-membrane"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.</a> nicely shows the cochlear tonotopy (i.e., high frequencies in the base, low frequencies in the apex); </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERAIB.jpg"" alt=""cochlea""></p>

<p>As to your question <strong>why the basal region is more sensitive to aging</strong> - that is a very good and interesting question that has <strong>not been answered, as far as I am aware</strong>. What is known, however, is that the basal regions of the cochlea are also more sensitive to the damaging effects of <strong>ototoxic antibiotics</strong> such as kanamycin (<a href=""https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCkQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FHuib_Versnel%2Fpublication%2F47660604_Effects_of_electrical_stimulation_on_the_acoustically_evoked_auditory-nerve_response_in_guinea_pigs_with_a_high-frequency_hearing_loss%2Flinks%2F0c96053cd1c55581f2000000&amp;ei=JYe8VJjTO-PPmwX_4oGQCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHO_pbdR5L3pW2btsnZGDdtEo-iLA&amp;sig2=S1nw5B9anvl__Iwy7eNgLA&amp;bvm=bv.83829542,d.dGY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stronks <em>et al</em>., 2011</a>) and other aminoglycosides, and some <strong>chemotherapeutics</strong> such as cisplatin (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3596108/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Schacht <em>et al</em>., 2012</a>). In low doses these compounds specifically target the basal regions over the apical ones (at high doses the whole cochlea is affected). </p>

<p>Perhaps the <strong>specific anatomy and circulation</strong> causes the basal region to be affected more by these chemicals. For example, blood flow may be enhanced basally whereby environmental and food-based chemicals may enter the basal region more readily (educated guesses, I can dig up references of authors posing these possibilities if necessary). This scenario may also contribute to presbyacusis, since it is quite imaginable that years of exposure to various substances may cause accumulation damage specifically to the basal parts of the cochlea. </p>

<p>In addition, since high frequencies are coded in the basal region, and given that sound enters the cochlea in the basal region (see picture below), <strong>all sounds</strong>, including damaging loud low-frequency stimuli <strong>first travel to the base</strong> on their way to their point of processing. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M9fxb.jpg"" alt=""Cochlea structure""></p>

<p>Because sound is analyzed as a travelling wave, sound travel stops at that point where the frequency matches the cochlear characteristic frequency. There the wave quickly dies out due to cochlear filtering (<a href=""http://www.psypress.com/cw/mather-9781841696997/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mather, 2006</a>); see the first picture above. In effect, more apical parts of the cochlea are exposed less frequently to (damaging) sound stimuli, while the <strong>base of the cochlea is exposed to all sounds entering the inner ear</strong>. </p>

<p>Hence, <strong>chemical exposure and acoustic wear and tear</strong> may be more prominent in the cochlear base, which can explain why <strong>presbyacusis starts at the very high frequencies and progresses to low frequencies</strong> (upward in the cochlea) from there.         </p>

"What causes adenosine build up in the brain when awake?","17130","","<p>Adenosine is an important hormone in sleep regulation.  It is postulated that when a person is awake, there is a build up of adenosine in the brain, which inhibits the neurons in the brain, and produces tiredness.  (See answer for more information:  <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7667/what-causes-humans-to-be-sleepy"">What causes humans to be sleepy?</a>)</p>

<p>However, I am wondering what specifically causes this adenosine build up.  I understand ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) is broken down to ADP in the brain to produce energy.  I thought this ADP would then be used to re-generate ATP again etc, so I'm not sure how adenosine is built up in the brain over a day.</p>

<p>Basically I am unsure how Adenosine itself, as opposed to ATP or ADP, is produced during the waking state?</p>

<p>My theory is that during the high demand waking state there is insufficient energy to convert ADP back to ATP, and the excess ADP is broken down to adenosine somehow.</p>

<p>I would appreciate an explanation of how this build up occurs, and also an explanation of how this in turn how it induces sleepiness would be a plus.</p>
","<p>Adenosine causes humans to become sleepy. But how ? </p>

<ul>
<li>During day time we consume food which is broken down into glucose. This glucose is broken down by ""<a href=""http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/301notes1.htm"">Glycolysis</a>"" in cell's cytoplasm during which ATP is produced. This produced ATP is is then used by body as an energy supplier. ATP breaks down into ADP and then AMP with the release of energy which our body consumes for doing work. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1h8zf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>(Fig 1- Structure of <a href=""http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/36/36_1/atp.html"">Adenosine to ATP</a>)</p>

<p>Adenosine is produced continuously and starts to accumulate around and in Adenosine receptors such as A1, A2a, A2b and A3 (as shown in fig below).Adenosine inhibit signal propagation and energy production in at least A1. (Not all the receptors induce sleep when they receive Adenosine.) ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_A1_receptor"">A1 receptor</a>"" receives adenosine and induces sleep. A1 receptors are implicated in sleep promotion by inhibiting wake-promoting cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DSA6r.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Continuous inhibition of A1 receptor by Adenosine slowly induces sleep by relaxing the brain and muscles but without substantially weakening their abilities!</p>

<p>How is Adenosine metabolized ?</p>

<p>During sleep the accumulated Adenosine is metabolized by Adenosine deaminase enzyme which catalyzes the irreversible deamination of 2'-deoxyadenosine and adenosine to deoxyinosine and inosine. With the reduction in the Adenosine content the body is excited from sleep slowly.</p>

<p>So in short summarize:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The accumulation of adenosine during waking periods is thus associated
  with the depletion of the ATP reserves stored as glycogen in the
  brain. The increased adenosine levels trigger non-REM sleep, during
  which the brain is less active, thus placing it in a recovery phase
  that is absolutely essential—among other things, to let it rebuild its
  stores of glycogen. </p>
  
  <p>Because adenosine is continuously metabolized by the enzyme adenosine
  desaminase, the decline in adenosine production during sleep quickly
  causes a general decline in adenosine concentrations in the brain,
  eventually producing conditions more favourable to awakening.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Booklice</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
  
  <p>Booklice, also called psocids, are not true lice. While they resemble lice in size and shape, booklice feed only on fungi or mold. If you find them in grain or other stored food products, it is an indication of high humidity which encourages mold growth. In addition to food products, psocids may be found under wallpaper, in furniture, along the sides of windows or on window sills around potted plants. Booklice do not bite, transmit disease, or damage food or fabric, but they can be very annoying when present in large numbers.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Biology</strong></p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w9xt6.jpg"" alt=""Booklice""></p>
  
  <p>Booklice found inside homes are wingless and very tiny: less than 1/16 of an inch long. While their back legs are thicker than the other four, and resemble the legs found in jumping insects, booklice do not jump, but run about rather quickly.</p>
  
  <p>Adult booklice range in color from translucent white to gray or brown. Females can produce about 60 eggs during the warm summer months and their life cycle (from egg to adult) can be completed in less than one month. When cool temperatures prevail, female booklice produce fewer eggs and the time required to complete their life cycle is over three months. Females deposit their eggs singly and often conceal them by covering with debris. Booklice undergo simple metamorphosis, that is their nymphs look just like adults except that they are much smaller and sexually immature. The common house-infesting booklice normally have four nymphal stages.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Injury</strong></p>
  
  <p>Booklice feed on molds and will overrun cereals and similar materials that support mold growth. Their presence, therefore, is a nuisance and can render some foods unfit. The starchy paste of wallpaper and books also can support mold growth or may be attacked directly by booklice. Outside of annoyance, their damage is insignificant.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Management</strong></p>
  
  <p>The best way to control booklice is to eliminate moist environmental conditions. Reducing the humidity in your home will eliminate the mold on which the booklice feed. Lowering the relative humidity to less than 50% will prevent their development. An air space under potted plants on windowsills will help keep the humidity down and reduce mold growth. Throw away any infested food material and make sure other foods are kept dry. Pesticides are not normally necessary to control booklice in homes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Warning</strong></p>
  
  <p>Pesticides are poisonous. Read and follow directions and safety precautions on labels. Handle carefully and store in original labeled containers out of the reach of children, pets, and livestock. Dispose of empty containers right away, in a safe manner and place. Do not contaminate forage, streams, or ponds.</p>

In humans, cold shock response is perhaps the most common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The cold water can cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction, the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body. For people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. Inhalation of water (and thus drowning) may result from hyperventilation. Some people, due to body type or mental conditioning, are much better able to survive swimming in very cold water."" <strong>But</strong>: "" A person who survives the initial minute of trauma (after falling into icy water), can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they don't drown.""</p>

<p>1) Quoting the book <a href=""https://www.inkling.com/read/principles-of-medical-biochemistry-meisenberg-simmons-3rd/chapter-22/fructose-is-the-principal-sugar"">here</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seminal fluid contains up to 11 mmol/L (200 mg/dl) of free fructose.
  It is the major energy source for the sperm cells in their
  all-important race for the ovum. The advantage of fructose over
  glucose may be that many bacteria, which compete with the sperm cells
  for the available nutrient, prefer glucose to other energy sources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, to avoid other competitive bacteria and cells from utilising the energy source of sperm, fructose is used as the energy source since the bacteria prefer glucose.  </p>

<p>2)Another reason is that the metabolism of sorbitol into fructose is energetically efficient way (no ATP required) as compared to glycolytic conversion of glucose into fructose(G$\rightarrow$G6P$\rightarrow$F6P$\rightarrow$F). Tapping the polyol pathway is energetically preferred to metabolizing fructose produced during glycolysis.This is only to show the possible evolution of the polyol pathway once the advantage of using fructose as the energy source was established. It does not explain why the fructose was advantageuos but just that if it was advantageous, the semen-producers would develop the currently existing machinery to produce fructose as the exclusive source of energy.   </p>

<p>Hence, sperms (seminal secretion) contains fructose as the primary energy source and not glucose.</p>

"Origin, or source, of rhesus negative in human blood","16824","","<p>This is my first post here, so please be gentle. I recently learned that I have Rh- blood (I'm A-), and was idly looking into blood types on Wikipedia. I was surprised to find that relatively few (~15% of all) humans have it, and most of those seem to be European. Looking just a little further, I found a bunch of crackpot-looking sites that try to explain how people got Rh- blood, and what weird abilities they possess as a result.</p>

<p>I managed to find one site that seemed at least less laughable, which suggested that interbreeding with <em>Homo neanderthalensis</em> (or possibly <em>Homo sapiens neanderthalensis</em>, since the site seemed to indicate that there was some question about how different <em>H. s. sapiens</em> were from <em>H. neanderthalensis</em>) might have accounted for the introduction of the condition.</p>

<p>It seems that from more reputable (medical) sources, the only difference between Rh+ and Rh- is that complications can arise during pregnancy if the mother is Rh- and the fetus is Rh+. Indeed, most sites (e.g., WebMD) seem to explicitly state that there are no other differences of note.</p>

<p>I am not a biologist, or an anthropologist, or a life-science kind of guy at all. However, as a computer scientist, I like to think that I have both an open mind but one which demands scientific and/or logico-mathematical evidence for claims. Lots of the pseudo-scientific, paranormal, etc. theories on the web I basically dismiss out of hand, as explanations which are almost certainly fantasies, but most definitely baseless and untestable.</p>

<p>My question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What, if any, is the current scientific understanding of the origin, or source, of rhesus negative blood in human beings? Do individuals with Rh- blood have any common (in a statistically significant sense) characteristics or health issues, aside from the issue with pregnancy and tending to be more European than not? Is there anything to continuing to look into this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For context, I got started down this rabbit hole while looking into different dieting strategies, and found the ""blood type diet"". Just as an aside, I don't think there's a lot of merit to that diet... sounds like a fad thing. Any sources or information or help on this subject are appreciated.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I have been looking a little more, and I stumbled across a paper entitled, ""The influence of RhD phenotype on toxoplasmosis and age-associated changes in personality profile of blood donors"" which looks at the effect of the Rh- trait on personality changes caused by toxoplasmosis (if you Google the title, you should be able to download). Using Cloninger's and Cattel's personality factors, they seem to show a variety of things, including (a) personality differences between Rh+ and Rh- individuals not affected by toxoplasmosis, and (b) different reactions to prolonged toxoplasmosis affection in Rh+ and Rh- individuals.</p>

<p>I didn't even know that parasites could affect your behavior; that seems frightening on the one hand, but on the other, it's fascinating if it's for real, especially since the incidence of toxoplasmosis is not insignificant in most people. Anybody who knows anything about this or who reads the paper and can help me understand what it's saying would be doing me a great favor to answer/comment/chat. Thanks!</p>
","<p>Your question has many questions in it. </p>

<p>As for the evolution of Rh factor, <a href=""http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/91/3/205.abstract"">Blancher and Apoil (2000)</a> attribute the high level of sequence similarity (92%) of the two <em>RH</em> locus genes, <em>RHD</em> and <em>RHCE</em> to a gene duplication event in the common ancestor of human, chimps, and gorillas. Their analysis of the cDNA from these genes revealed ""complex recombination events"" after the lineages split.</p>

<p>Basically the most recent common ancestor of apes had the ""human"" <em>RH</em> genes, which then differentiated after the lineages diverged. Duplicate and differentiate is a common theme in evolution.</p>

<p>As for why it's called rhesus antigen, that's just as experimental artifact:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term ""Rhesus antigen"" was introduced by Landsteiner and Wiener,
  who found that rabbits (and later, guinea pigs) immunized with red
  blood cells (RBCs) from a rhesus monkey produced antibodies which
  agglutinated 85% of Caucasian blood samples (Landsteiner and Wiener
  1940, 1941).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They probably weren't even correct about the antibodies being rhesus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In conclusion, if the term ""Rh"" was coined by Landsteiner and Wiener
  because of the source of antigens (the rhesus monkey) they used to
  obtain anti-Rh in rabbits, it is highly probable that, in fact, they
  produced anti-LW antibodies.</p>

"Speciation by polyploidy","16751","","<p>Speciation can occur by polyploidy. My understanding of the process is as follows:</p>

<p>'polyploidy is when the number of chromosomes in an organism's cell doubles. This means that the organism has more chromosomes than other individuals of the same species, meaning it cannot mate with other individuals. The polyploidy organism then evolves, eventually leading to it becoming a separate species'. </p>

<p>I realise this may not be exactly correct. Is someone able to provide a better description of speciation by polyploidy?</p>
","<p>By definition, polyploidy just means that a cell or organism contains more than 2 pairs of homologous chromosomes (or is more than 2n). This is more common in plants than it is in animals. The plant, as shown below, undergoes failed meiosis, which means that the diploid (2n) cells never become haploid (n). As a result, a plant ends up with more than 2n when it self-polinates. The shown result is tetraploidy (4n), but there are other possible results (3n, 5n, etc).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nrZX9.png"" alt=""Polyploidization""> </p>

<p>Multiple plants within a population can end up with the same polyploidy number. They can then reproduce with each other but not with the original plants or any other plants. As a result, they become biologically isolated from the original group of plants and are considered a different species. It is a type of sympatric speciation, which means that it occurs without geographic isolation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not that such a supplement exists, but is it biologically possible to treat filaggrin deficiency with something taken orally?</p>
","<p>Direct replacement of a protein through oral supplementation is extremely unlikely. Our digestive tract is designed to break down proteins into their constituent amino acids. </p>

<p>In the stomach pepsin breaks proteins into polypeptides which then pass into the small intestine. At this point (second part of duodenum) multiple enzymes (proteases) enter having been released from the pancreas in response to eating. These enzymes further reduced the polypeptides into smaller components such as you end up with component parts of the original protein.</p>

<p>These component parts are then transported across the intestine into the blood through cells lining the intestinal lumen (enterocytes). Enterocytes also have proteolytic action on long chains of amino acids.</p>

<p>As a result of this process, the original structure of the ingested protein is destroyed. However you do end up with the constituent amino acids. If your fillagrin or any other protein deficiency is as a result of lack of nutrients then in response your body may be able to synthesise the required protein. If on the other hand your deficiency is due to a gene defect, despite having the building blocks for the protien you will continue be deficient.</p>

"Molecularly, why can you straighten or perm hair?","16642","","<p>I'm aware that hair can be curly because of the disulfide bond interactions in between cysteine amino acids in alpha-keratin filaments. However, I'm curious as to the biochemistry involved in straightening hair with a straightening iron, as well as with ""perming"" hair. </p>

<p>What happens at the molecular level? I suspect that a straightening iron simply disrupts the present disulfide bonds, but I'm only speculating.</p>
","<p><strong>For straightening hair with a flat iron</strong>:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/ask/index.html?quid=708"">This source</a> provided by bobthejoe states that temporarily straightening hair involves the breaking of hydrogen bonds between keratin molecules within hair.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the reasons hair is curly is because of hydrogen bonds between the proteins (keratin) that make up your hair [...]. Another way to alter hydrogen bonds is with heat; electric straighteners work because of this principle. The platters on electric straighteners are flat so that when your hair cools it takes the shape of ""flat"" as the hydrogen bonds reform. The same thing occurs with curling irons, but since the heating element is circular, the hair stays curled as it cools. The effect of heat, however, is temporary, over time the hydrogen bonds eventually return to their original form and the hairs goes back to the way they were. This rearrangement happens because moisture in the air hydrates the proteins. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.ewg.org/hair-straighteners/our-report/how-to-get-straight-hair-whats-the-best-option/"">This source</a> provides a similar explanation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Running a flat iron through blown-dry hair breaks the hair’s hydrogen bonds. It flattens hair until water or water vapor (from humidity, drizzle or the shower) penetrates the hair fiber and allows the hydrogen bonds to revert to their natural positions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the straightening of hair with an flat iron does not involve the breakage of disulfide bonds as I had originally hypothesized.</p>

<p><strong>For perming hair</strong>:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.yalescientific.org/2010/04/everyday-qa-how-does-a-perm-work/"">This article</a> suggests that perming involves the chemical treatment of hair with reducing agents to break the present disulfide bonds between cysteine amino acids, followed by the reformation of the disulfide bonds in the desired curled shape.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a standard “cold” perm, hair is put into curlers and the reducing agent ammonium thioglycolate is added. The disulfide bonds break and keratin molecules are now free to move around and adjust to the shape of the curl. Then a “neutralizer,” such as hydrogen peroxide, is added to reverse the effect of the reducing agent. New disulfide bonds form so the keratin molecules are locked into the shape of the curls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perm_%28hairstyle%29"">This Wikipedia article</a> also suggests that the <em>chemical</em> straightening of hair is obtained with the same process.</p>

"Is consuming proteins different vs. consuming amino-acids and how?","16589","","<p>Yesterday I had a discussion with a friend. He said that consuming proteins and amino-acids is different. He said that those who grow muscles would agree on that. I wanted to argue against that statement, but I lacked arguments... As far as I know, amino-acids are part of proteins. So, when proteins go to our body with food, we digest it and make amino-acids. Then they can form any kind of proteins we need. The same would happen when consuming amino-acids directly, not in protein form. Maybe then the process would be faster. But from my point of view, there is no much of a difference. Could anyone please give me a more sound opinion on why is consuming proteins and amino-acids different, if it is?</p>
","<p>To put it shortly: </p>

<ul>
<li>Proteins have properties that individual amino acids that make up the protein does not have. </li>
<li>Similarly the individual amino acids have properties that the protein does not have. </li>
</ul>

<p>This is analogous to elements vs compounds. </p>

<p>The site referenced below quotes 3 experiments done to examine this phenomena. </p>

<p>All experiments compared effectiveness of whey protein with that of essential amino acid (EAA) supplements. Experiments 1 and 2 involved old people while experiment 3 involved young people. </p>

<p>Conclusion of experiments is as follows: </p>

<ol>
<li>Both EAA and whey protein (15 g of EAA and 15 g whey was taken by the respective groups) induced muscle growth, however EAA had better anabolic effect as compared to whey. </li>
<li>In this 3 groups were compared. 15 g of whey vs 6.72 g of EAA vs. 7.57 g of non-essential amino acids. <strong>Whey had higher anabolic effect as compared to EAA while the third group showed no improvement</strong>. This additional anabolic effect is attributed to unknown mechanisms. The anabolic effect was measured using a different method add compared to the first experiment. So results may not be comparable. </li>
<li>In this 3 groups of young men were compared. The first group was given carbohydrate (30 g) and EAA (15 g) drink, the second group liquid meal containing same quantity of EAA and total 850 calories while the third group was given both. The conclusion: 
<ul>
<li>The third group, as expected had the highest anabolic rate </li>
<li>The first group (protein and carbohydrate drink) had better anabolic rate when compared with the liquid meal group though they both took the same amount of EAA. The difference was in carbohydrate content. The liquid meal had higher carbohydrates content when compared with the first group. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Whey has insulinogenic effect invitro. Whey also has the same effect whether taken before or after exercise while the protein drink has better effect when taken before exercise. </p>

<p>Among amino acids leucine, when taken alone has anabolic effect comparable to a mixture of EAA. </p>

<p>In conclusion: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, whey contains various bioactive peptides that act to enhance recovery and potentially in other ways that positively effect the adaptive process to exercise (12). These bioactive peptides are not found in EAA, BCAA, or Leucine, and appear to be a unique quality to dairy proteins. So what we can't say is that these aminos are the deciding factor in whey's effects...or that we can use one in place of the other (interchangeably) in all cases.</p>

"Why can't the human eye focus blue light?","16374","","<p>I recently noticed that it is hard to focus on blue light sources, especially at night. When observing a blue light source, e.g. a neon sign, it looks somewhat blurry. A sign with a different colour right beside it looks sharp.</p>

<p>I already know about the three kinds of cone cells in the human eye (I'm not a biologist) with their spectral sensitivity peaks in in short (S, 420–440 nm), middle (M, 530–540 nm), and long (L, 560–580 nm) light wavelengths [1]. But does the spectral sensitivity correlate with focus? Or does our eye lens refract blue light in a different way?</p>

<p>When I screw up my eyes looking at a blue light, it becomes less blurry, but then all the other colours are blurred.</p>

<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell#/media/File:Cones_SMJ2_E.svg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell#/media/File:Cones_SMJ2_E.svg</a></p>
","<p>The same thing happens in photography when you see an image with colorful shadows of objects on it - this is called chromatic aberration. Check <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> wiki page if you're not familiar with. Now this happens because the lens in the objective has different refractive properties for different wavelengths or if go the other way around different wavelengths refract differently within the same material. This is why the famous triangular rainbow prism is capable of separating the sunlight to rainbow. So back to the question: in our eye there is the eye lens that is responsible for focusing. Let's assume that it is homogenous enough. So when light enters into our lens it refracts to separate colours and our lens is not complex enough to fully compensate for this. The second picture is a good approximation of the human eye lens in shape.</p>

<p>Edit: so when you focus one color perfectly the others will be blurry a bit since those will be out of focus due to different refraction.</p>

I can't find a good explanation in the article, or in any other article, as to how this assay works. I understand the cells are transfected with TOPflash/FOPflash reporter plasmids, but that's about it. Any insight or redirection would be much appreciated.</p>
","<p>From what I can understand, TOPflash is a luciferase reporter plasmid that contains two sets of 3 copies of the wild-type TCF binding regions. If the canonical Wnt signaling is activated, beta-catenin will translocate to the nucleus to associate with TCF/LEF transcription factors to activate transcription of Wnt target genes. Since this is a luciferase plasmid, you should see an increase in relative luciferase activity when substrate is added. If Wnt signaling is inhibited, you will see loss of luciferase expression. The FOPflash is used as a negative control because the TCF binding regions upstream of the luciferase gene is mutated so even if beta-catenin translocates to the nucleus to activate TCF-mediated transcription, you should not see any luciferase activity.</p>

Then I thought that this motion doesn't seem very natural from another cat's viewpoint, so my cat probably didn't try to imitate some other cat all of a sudden and learned it like that. This action must have been caused by something else then. Or at least that's what I think.</p>

<p>Both animals and people stretch their muscles from time to time, but it doesn't seem to be caused by memory of others doing it. So how does this action originate in them?</p>
","<p>Humans and other animals have lots of innate behaviors that are not learned from observation, i.e. behaviors that are hard-wired into our nervous system, and this is one of them. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_reflexes#Sucking_reflex"">Suckling reflexes</a> in mammals and the <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003293.htm"">Moro reflex</a> is human babies (which we grow out of) are other simple examples.</p>

<p>The stretching behaviours you are referring to are usually labelled <em>pandiculation</em> in humans (defined as involuntary stretching of the soft tissues), and yawning is often considered a special case of this. These kinds of behaviours are also normally related to transition periods between high-low activity in animals (<a href=""http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877%2806%2900060-0/abstract"">Walusinskie, 2006</a>). In practice, stretching functions as a way to reverse the muscular atonia during REM sleep, and is in this sense a way to restore homeostatic functions (<a href=""http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/0168-1591%2889%2990117-2/abstract"">Fraser, 1989</a>; <a href=""http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877%2806%2900060-0/abstract"">Walusinskie, 2006</a>). </p>

<p>A paper by <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20109487"">Rial et al (2010)</a> deals with the evolution of sleep and wakefulness in mammals from our reptile predecessors, and indicates that stretching behaviours might have originated/evolved from post-basking activities, more specifically risk-assessment behaviours, such as: </p>

This commonly happens due to stimulation of the retinal ganglion cells by something else. The most frequent source in normal individuals is pressure to the retina (e.g. rubbing a closed eye.) It is also possible for phosphenes to occur due to neuronal stimulation at the cortical level. Most people have had the experience of “seeing stars” when you stand up too quickly. This happens because <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/orthostatic-hypotension/basics/definition/con-20031255"">orthostatic hypotension</a> results in transiently decreased cerebral perfusion; it is the metabolic shift in oxygenation and/or glucose delivery to cortical neurons that causes the perception of light. Something similar occurs with brief rises in intracranial pressure that occurs with sneezing or coughing.* <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618215"">Magnetic stimuli</a> can also induce this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Phosphenes can also be pathologic (i.e. disease-associated).

And this can cause problems: When you denature the proteins of the bacterial cell wall, they will form some kind of protective layer around some of the cells which allows their survival. Diluting the alcohols makes the disinfection happening slower and thus gives the alcohols more time to get into the cell. </p>

"What determines if an allele is dominant or recessive?","16094","","<p>Going back to my high school days we were taught about dominant and recessive genes. We were taught how to calculate the geneotype and pheneotype of potential offspring using a small table (forgotten the actual table name). But it never occurred to me then what determines if a gene is dominant or recessive and how this is carried out biologically.</p>

<p>Take my example below, there is a 50% change that an offspring will carry both the tall (T) and short (t) genes. What determines that the tall gene T has a dominant effect over the short gene t. </p>

<p>Now, I know that there is going to be differences between the different genes (i.e. eye colour), but is there a general description any one and provide which states how a gene becomes dominant and how the dominant effect is carried out biologically.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X3IFx.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Dominance is seldom complete. Owing to effects like co-dominance, incomplete dominance, collaborative (additive) effects of polygenes, our classical concept of dominance doesn't work. Having said that, there are certain ways in which a gene, if showing complete dominance can be analysed from the molecular level.   </p>

<p>In an individual heterozygous for a certain trait, the following possibilities exist:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Both the alleles, though different, code for a protein (which might be an enzyme or a regulatory protein) which is functional and is indistinguishable atleast in terms of its functions. In this case, no matter if the person is heterozygous or homozygous for either allele, the concerned protein will be in sufficient amounts and will always be functional. These alleles can be treated as the same allele while performing Mendelian analysis though their products might differ slightly, leading to formation of two (or more) functionally similar <strong><em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloenzyme"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Alloenzymes</a></em></strong> (as opposed to Isozymes which are similar enzymes produced by genes at different loci).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Haplosufficiency</em></strong>. In this case, one of the two alleles codes for a functional protein and the other either codes for a non-functional protein (or does not code at all). But, even in heterozygous condition where only one allele producing functional protein is present, the amount of protein produced is sufficient to show the phenotype and hence, even in heterozygous individuals, enough protein is coded for by the single functional allele exhibiting the normal phenotype. If the two non-functional alleles are present as a homozygous pair, no functional protein is synthesised and hence the phenotype is not shown (i.e a different phenotype is shown). Here, the functional allele is Haplosufficient (able to produce enough protein in heterozygous condition) and is called the dominant since it expresses its phenotype both in heterozygous and homozygous conditions. this is pretty common.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Complete Haploinsufficiency</em></strong>. Here again one allele codes for a functional protein while the other does not. But this time, if the functional allele is present in heterozygous condition, then the amount of the protein produced is not at all sufficient and hence the phenotype is not exhibited. Here the non-functional allele is said to be dominant because heterozygous phenotype resembles the phenotype of homozygous non-functional allele (where no protein is synthesized) since the functional allele is completely haploinsufficient (unable to produce enough protein in heterozygous condition). This method is pretty rare.(e.g rare autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>If there is <strong>partial haplosufficiency /partial haploinsufficiency</strong>, the phenomenon of incomplete dominance can be explained. (heterozygous individual produces protein not sufficient for a full-blown phenotype but just a partial expression of the phenotype)</p>

<p><em>Here, ""functional"" refers to being actually ""functional"" as in case of flower colour (anthocyanin synthesis) or just performing certain kind of a conversion leading to a particular effect on thephenotype.</em></p>

"What is the functional difference between hemoglobin and ferritin?","16038","","<p>I read that both hemoglobin and ferritin are for storing iron in the body. So, what is the difference between them in terms of storing/binding iron?</p>
","<p>Hemoglobin is the protein of erythrocytes (red blood cells) which has ferrous ions (Fe2+) bound in its subunits. These are able to keep oxygen bound which enables the cell to transport oxygen through the circulation. It's not really for storage of iron, it's for using it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin#Iron_storage"" rel=""nofollow"">Ferritin</a> is the actual storage protein, cells express it to store iron in case of deficiency and also to regulate the amount they have in the cell. According to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16448386"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, it's mainly expressed in muscle, liver and kidney cells (but I'm not too sure about the details of that study so I might have got that wrong).</p>

<p>Edit: just found this in one of my old lectures; unfortunately it doesn't quote sources: ferritin stores iron in liver and heart. The total iron in the body is ~3.9g, of which 2.5g are in use in hemoglobin, 500mg in stores (an additional 250mg in the liver), 150mg in bone marrow, 300mg in myoglobin and 150mg in other enzymes. The remaining 5mg are bound to transferrin in the plasma.</p>

"Why does the affinity of haemoglobin's for oxygen decrease at high altitudes?","16011","","<p>My class 12 NCERT book says, Pg 226</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The body compensates low oxygen availability by increasing red blood cell production, decreasing the binding affinity of haemoglobin and by increasing breathing rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why should the haemoglobin binding capacity decrease at high altitude?</p>

<p>I think it should increase for better oxygen transfer and uptake from air. The concentrtion of oxygen in the atmosphere decreases with height. Hence, if the haemoglobin binding increases, we will be able to draw more oxygen from the air and transport it to the cells.</p>
","<p>Haemoglobin's job is to transport oxygen and not store it. Therefore it should also be able to release oxygen effectively. When the differences in partial pressure of oxygen between the tissues and blood are low then oxygen will not be transported to the tissues from blood, leading to hypoxia. </p>

<p>2,3 Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) stabilizes the T- (taut; oxygen unbound) form of haemoglobin thereby reducing its affinity to bind to oxygen. 2,3-BPG is found to be elevated in people living at high altitudes. The production of 2,3-BPG is controlled by a negative feedback (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/bj3420597"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mulquiney et al., 1999</a>; also see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,3-Bisphosphoglyceric_acid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a>) so that it does not overdo its job. </p>

<p><a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/44386/3340"">David's answer</a> explains the dynamics in details and addresses the non-linear (sigmoidal) nature of Hb-Oxygen binding which is a critical point for understanding how the effect of 2,3-BPG is actually favourable. </p>

<p>However, haemoglobin content also increases so that higher amounts of oxygen can be captured. This is a fine balance and as you may notice (even if you do not read it to great depth) in the linked paper, there are many mechanisms that are working towards this. </p>

"How would the result of Hershey and Chase experiment been different if protein was the genetic material?","16003","","<p>Please answer in simple terms im only in 9th grade.</p>
","<p>Hershey and Chase did two experiments to prove that DNA is the carrier of the genetic information.
First, they grew phages (viruses which infect bacteria) in a medium containing radioactive sulphur (<sup>35</sup>S). This marked all the proteins of the phage (the hull) radioactive. They then used this phage to infect bacteria. To do so, the phage attaches to the surface of the bacteria and injects its genetic material. This looks like in this picture from the Wikipedia page on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bacteriophages</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wzWnJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The bacteria with the attached phages are then blended, so they will loose the attachment to the bacterial surface. The mixture of bacteria and phages is then centrifuged, this makes the heavy bacteria sediment at the bottom of the tube, the lighter phages stay in the supernatant. Hershey and Chase then measured where the radioactivity from the marked phage proteins had gone, since they found it in the supernatant, they knew, that no proteins had entered the bacteria.
If proteins would have been the carrier of the genetic information they would have entered the bacteria and had been found in the sediment inside the bacteria.</p>

<p>In the second experiment (the proof if you want to say so) they marked the DNA of the phages radioactive (with radioactive phosphorus, <sup>32</sup>P). They repeated the experiment and found the radioactivity in the sediment with the bacteria, proving, that the DNA had indeed entered the bacteria. 
If the DNA wouldn't be the carrier, it wouldn't have entered the bacteria and would have stayed in solution.</p>

What actually happens when cells are ""competent""? What governs transformation efficiency (besides obvious things like amount of DNA or cells)?</p>

<p>To make it clear what I'm talking about, I use a protocol like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>specificity constant</strong>,the rate constant for the conversion of E + S to E + P</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However I can't find any detailed explanation WHY you should devide the K<sub>cat</sub> by K<sub>m</sub>. Secondly K<sub>m</sub> is HALF of V<sub>max</sub> (so actullay at half saturation) but K<sub>cat</sub> is at full saturation, deviding these two numbers makes no sense to me. <strong>So to summerize I'm asking : What is the ""meaning"" of the division of these two consants?</strong></p>

<p><em>definitions are derived/edited from Lehninger principles of biochemistry</em></p>
","<p>Just as $k_{cat}$ represents the rate of reaction at saturating substrate concentration, $k_{cat} / K_m$ represents the rate of the reaction at negligible substrate concentration.</p>

<p>If we take a look at the standard one substrate/one product Michaelis–Menten kinetics rate equation:</p>

<p>$$v = \frac{k_{cat}[E][S]}{K_m + [S]}$$</p>

<p>We can imagine what happens when $[S] \to 0$, we see that when $[S] \ll K_m$, the denomiator can be reduced to $K_m$, and thus the rate equation becomes</p>

<p>$$v = \frac{k_{cat}}{K_m}[E][S]$$</p>

<p>Or in other words, $k_{cat} / K_m$ is the (pseudo-)second order rate constant between the enzyme and the substrate, when $[S] \ll K_m$.</p>

<p>In fact, when you get into more complex rate equations (like inhibitors, pH effects, and kinetic isotope effects) there's a decent argument (one often made by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Wallace_Cleland"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">W.W. Cleland</a>) to be made that the two key constants for enzymatic reactions are $k_{cat}$ and $k_{cat} / K_m$, and it's $K_m$ that should be thought of as the ""derived"" constant. (The fact that we write the rate equation in terms of $k_{cat}$ and $K_m$ is a historical accident - we could have just as easily had $ v = \frac{k_{cat}\Phi [E][S]}{K_m + \Phi [S]}$, where I've arbitrarily chosen $\Phi$ as the symbol for $k_{cat}/K_m$.)</p>

<p>This still leaves the issue of why $k_{cat} / K_m$ is often referred to as the ""specificity constant"" of the enzyme. The reason for this is that if you have a single enzyme in the presence of two different substrates, you have a competitive inhibition setup. The math is a little dense (see <a href=""http://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/ch331/transkinetics/olinhibition.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> or <a href=""http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/enztech/inhibition.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for examples), but the end result is that the ratio of reaction rates for the two substrates is related to the ratio of their respective $k_{cat} / K_m$'s:</p>

<p>$$\frac{v_a}{v_b} = \frac{k_{cat,A} / K_{m,A}}{k_{cat,B} / K_{m,B}}\frac{[A]}{[B]}$$</p>

<p>This actually makes intuitive sense, with the right mindset - the only stage where the two substrates are competing (where you make the decision to do reaction A versus reaction B) is when they're binding to free enzyme. ""The rate when you only care about free enzyme"" is equivalent to the negligible substrate case. With negligible substrate, all you have is free enzyme - there isn't enough substrate to have appreciable amounts of substrate-bound form, and the rate of enzyme-substrate encounter is much lower than the rate of product formation, meaning that in the steady state you don't have appreciable amounts of product-bound form, either. Thus the $k_{cat} / K_m$ for a particular substrate is representing how good the <em>free</em> enzyme is at performing that reaction.</p>

"Why is saltatory conduction in myelinated axons faster than continuous conduction in unmyelinated axons?","15684","","<p>How does spacing apart sodium and potassium channels allow the action potential to travel faster down the axon? This is the reason always cited for saltatory conduction and myelination, but my mental model of conduction tells me that the density of ion gates along the axon should not affect the speed of the AP. </p>

<p>To illustrate, consider a myelinated axon. A wave of Na$^+$ from action potential site 1, a node of Ranvier, rushes into and quickly diffuses down the axon. (It travels in both directions, but backwards is still in the refractory period.) It diffuses through the myelinated region, its concentration always diminishing. Before it attenuates too much, however, it happens upon node of Ranvier 2, where it triggers another action potential. A new wave of Na$^+$ rushes in and the cycle repeats. This should be plain so far.</p>

<p>Now imagine that there is actually a node of Ranvier halfway between node 1 and 2, called node 1.5. The wave of Na$^+$, on its way to node 2, happens to trigger an action potential at node 1.5, from which a wave of Na$^+$ pours in and either boosts the original wave or replaces it by taking its momentum. Now the reinforced wave proceeds to node 2 and triggers it just as soon as, perhaps even sooner than, if node 1.5 had not existed. Repeatedly insert nodes at higher densities until the situation is simply lack of myelination, and we conclude that unmyelinated axons can transmit an action-potential-triggering wave of Na+ as fast as or faster than a myelinated one.</p>

<p>In short, my point of confusion is this: <strong>I cannot see how a higher density of gated channels can possibly slow down the wavefront of Na+ that triggers action potentials.</strong> If anything, the additional influxes of Na+ should speed up the all-important wavefront, assuming that new waves really ""either boost the original wave or replace it by taking its momentum"", and also assuming that the wavefront of Na$^+$ is really all-important for signal transmission, and also assuming that the mere presence of (voltage?) gated ion channels in the membrane does not significantly retard the wavefront.</p>

<p>But the usual explanation for why saltatory conduction is faster than continuous conduction (a fact I hope is empirically and <em>unambiguously</em> established) relies on <strong>the putative slowing effect of ion channels on the signal fore. Please explain this effect in more detail, if it is not a misconception.</strong></p>
","<h1> Short Answer </h1>

<h1> Long Answer </h1>

<p>So you're right: myelination speeds up electrical conduction. Unmyelinated axon conduction velocities range from about 0.5 - 10 m/s, while myelinated axons can conduct at velocities up to 150 m/s -- <strong>that's 10-30x faster</strong>!!</p>

<p>But why? ...</p>

<h3> Let's Look at Action Potentials & Signal Propagation: </h3>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ph3B4.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ph3B4.png"" alt=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Action_potential.svg/300px-Action_potential.svg.png""></a></p>

<p>You can get a background of this process in numerous places (e.g., <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>), so I will just mention this briefly.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the neuron is at rest, ions are distributed so that the inside of the neuron cell is more negatively charged than the outside. This creates an electrical potential, called the resting membrane potential, across the cell membrane. </p></li>
<li><p>Sodium and potassium channels in the cell membrane control the flow of positively charged sodium (NA$^+$) and potassium (K$^+$) ions in/out of the cell to maintain this negative charge.</p></li>
<li><p>During depolarization, the cell membrane essentially becomes more permeable allowing NA$^+$ to enter the cell. This causes that section of axon to have a positive charge relative to the outside. </p></li>
<li><p>When this <em>positive voltage is great enough</em> (i.e., when an action potential is created), the influx triggers the same behavior in the neighboring section of the axon. Gradually, this positive charge on the inside of the cell moves down the length of the axon to the axon terminals.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3> The Main Takeaway: </h3>

<p>In this process, <strong>action potential generation occurs repeatedly along the length of the axon</strong>. </p>

<p>It's important to note two things about action potential propagation:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Each action potential takes time to occur.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The charge (i.e., voltage) that is created dissipates with $ \uparrow $ distance.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3> Time for some Math & Physics: </h3>

<p>In fact, we have equations to calculate both the time a voltage change takes to occur and how current flow decreases with distance. </p>

<ul>
<li>You can read more about the mathematics behind this and passive membrane properties in general <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11107/box/A192/?report=objectonly"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s1/chapter03.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Importantly, these equations rely on two constants: length and time. </p>

<p>The time constant, $\tau$, characterizes how rapidly current flow changes the membrane potential. $\tau$ is calculated as:</p>

<p>$$\tau = r_mc_m$$</p>

<p>where r$_m$ and c$_m$ are the resistance and capacitance, respectively, of the plasma membrane. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Resistance? Capacitance? Huh?...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Resistance</strong></a> = the measure of the difficulty to pass an electric current through a conductor.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Capacitance</strong></a> = the ability of a structure to store electrical charge.</p>

<ul>
<li>A capacitor consists of two conducting regions separated by an insulator. A capacitor works by accumulating a charge on one of the conducting surfaces, which ultimately results in an accumulation of oppositely charged ions on the other side of the surface. In a cellular sense, increased capacitance requires a greater ion concentration difference across the membrane.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The values of r$_m$ and c$_m$ depend, in part, on the size of the neuron: </p>

<ul>
<li>Larger cells have lower resistances and larger capacitances. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Importantly, however, is that these variables also rely on membrane structure. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>c$_m$ (the capacitance of the membrane) decreases as you separate the positive and negative charges. This could be the result of additional cellular structures (e.g., sheaths of fat) separating intracellular and extracellular charges. </p></li>
<li><p>r$_m$ (the resistance of the membrane potential) is the inverse of the <em>permeability</em> of the membrane. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The higher the permeability, the lower the resistance. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lower membrane resistance means you lose ions quicker and therefore signals travel less far</strong>  </p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>But why? This is where that length constant becomes important. The length constant, $\lambda$, can be simplified to:</p>

<p>$$ \lambda = \sqrt {\frac {r_m}{r_e + r_i} } $$</p>

<p>where, again r$_m$ represents the resistance of the membrane and r$_e$ and r$_i$ are the extracellular and intracellular resistances, respectively. (Note: r$_e$ and r$_i$ are typically very small). </p>

<p>Basically, if the membrane resistance r$_m$ is increased (perhaps due to lower  average ""leakage"" of current across the membrane) $\lambda$ becomes larger (i.e., the distance ions travel before ""leaking"" out of the cell increases), and the distance a voltage travels gets longer.</p>

<h3> Why am I telling you all of this?? </h3>

<p>How are the time constant and the space constant related to propagation velocity of action potentials? </p>

<p><strong>The propagation velocity is directly proportional to the space constant and inversely proportional to the time constant</strong>. <a href=""http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s1/chapter03.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">In summary</a>: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The smaller the time constant, the more rapidly a depolarization will affect the adjacent region. If a depolarization more rapidly affects an adjacent region, it will bring the adjacent region to threshold sooner. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Therefore, the smaller the time constant, the more rapid will be the propagation velocity.</strong> </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If the space constant is large, a potential change at one point would spread a greater distance along the axon and bring distance regions to threshold sooner. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Therefore, the greater the space constant</strong>, the more rapidly distant regions will be brought to threshold and <strong>the more rapid will be the propagation velocity.</strong> </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Sooo....</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you increase the layer of cells around the membrane, you decrease the electric field imparted by extracellular ions, which allows intracellular ions to move more freely in the axon. In other words, you decrease the capacitance. </p>

<ul>
<li>As a result, you have more cations available to depolarize other parts of the membrane.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If you decrease the permeability of the membrane (i.e., if you prevent ion pumps from moving ions in/out of the axon), you increase the resistance of the axon membrane, which allows for the voltage created in the action potential to travel farther before dissipating. </p>

<ul>
<li>By allowing the voltage to spread farther before necessitating the generation of another action potential, you reduce the time it takes for signal propagation. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, if you ""block"" ion pumps and decrease the concentration of anions near the axon membrane, you increase  membrane resistance (r$_m$) and decrease membrane capacitance (c$_m$), respectively. Together, this decreases the time of electronic conductance through the axon (and thus <strong>increase conduction velocity</strong>). </p>

<h3> Finally, to Myelin! </h3>

<p>Myelin greatly speeds up action potential conduction because of exactly that reason: <strong>myelin acts as an electrical insulator</strong>!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Myelin sheath reduces membrane capacitance and increases membrane resistance in the inter-node intervals, thus allowing a fast, saltatory movement of action potentials from node to node.</p></li>
<li><p>Essentially, myelination of axons reduces the ability for electrical current to leak out of the axon. More specifically, myelin prevents ions from entering or leaving the axon along myelinated segments. As a result, a local current can flow passively along a greater distance of axon. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So instead of having to contantly generate new action potentials along each  segment of the axon, the ionic current from an action potential at one node of Ranvier provokes another action potential at the next node. This apparent ""hopping"" of the action potential from node to node is known as <strong>saltatory conduction</strong>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4wN63.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4wN63.jpg"" alt=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10921/figure/A203/?report=objectonly""></a></p>

<h3> So Why not Just Myelinate the Entire Axon?? </h3>

<p>The length of axons' myelinated segments is important to the success of saltatory conduction. They should be as long as possible to maximize the speed of conduction, but not so long that the arriving signal is too weak to provoke an action potential at the next node of Ranvier. The nodes also can't be too frequent because, although adding a new node to the axon would increase its ability to generate sodium current, it would also increase the capacitance and thus diminish the effectiveness of other nearby nodes. </p>

"Why 20 amino acids instead of 64?","15633","","<p><a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/651/minimal-number-of-amino-acids-required"">This question</a> got me thinking about amino acids and the ambiguity in the genetic code. With 4 nucleotides in RNA and 3 per codon, there are 64 codons. However, these 64 codons only code for 20 amino acids (or 22 if you include <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenocysteine"" rel=""noreferrer"">selenocysteine</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrolysine"" rel=""noreferrer"">pyrrolysine</a>), so many of the amino acids are coded by multiple codons.</p>

<p>Is there any hypothesis as to why there are only 22 amino acids and not 64? Is it possible that there were 64 (or at least more than 22) at an earlier time?</p>
","<p>Brian Hayes wrote a very interesting article from a mathematical point of view:</p>

<p>especially the ""Reality intrudes"" section. Basically people had created fancy mathematical reasons why it has to be exactly 20. Nature, being nature, does not follow the reasoning, but has its own ideas. In other words there was nothing especially special about 20. In fact there seems to be a slow grafting of a 21st amino acid, selenocysteine using the codon UGA. Also pyrrolysine is considered the 22nd. The last section suggests that the code was originally doublet, so coded for &lt;16 amino acids. This can partly explain why the third base in each codon is not as discriminating.</p>

<p>So perhaps in the year 2002012 someone will be asking on biology.stackexchange why there are only 40 amino acids.</p>

But, I am wondering, would infrequent inhalation of helium cause long term harm to the throat? in particular, the vocal cords?</p>
","<p>When we speak, our vocal cords vibrate to the air. Helium makes them vibrate a lot faster (that's what makes the funny sound of your voice after inhaling helium), because its atoms are a lot lighter than nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Obviously, lighter atoms, can travel faster. This faster vibrations are unusual to the cords and they can cause sore throat or even strong throat ache. After you stop inhaling the gas, things should get back to normal, especially if the inhalation really is infrequent. </p>

<p>Breathing helium balloons at parties is a very dangerous fun activity, because it replaces the oxygen and this could lead to hypoxia - a condition when tissues can't get enough oxygen one reason or another. In some cases, this could even be fatal. </p>

<p>Even though inhaling of pure helium is dangerous, in submarines, divers breathe a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen and helium as helium is better under higher pressures. At these depths the low density of helium is found to considerably reduce the effort of breathing. Divers often have problems with dry throat and constant thirst due to the need of more oxygen. At least, inhaling helium, when it's mixed with oxygen, is far less harmful than breathing it directly from a balloon. </p>

","<p>You are correct that reduction is simply a gain of electrons. This results in a decrease in oxidation number.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_agent"" rel=""noreferrer"">reducing agent</a> that is donating the electrons is the hydrogen. More correctly, the electrons come from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydride"" rel=""noreferrer"">hydride</a> (H<sup>-</sup>).</p>

<p>The authors used a GFP-lac fusion to observe a series of sections of the male fly in meiosis with integrated lac - specific binding regions.

<p>This isn't my main field, but as I understand it, many aspects of meiosis are still being mapped out.  </p>

<p>As to the question of <em>how this evolved and why</em>; its definitely strange. 
 It looks like there is a gender selected trait where the SC doesn't form in males.  Its easy to imagine a mutation that caused males only to lose recombination - the process is so complex its hard to imagine such a trait not showing up. </p>

<p>Still it's surprising to think that the trait has not only survived but become dominant in <em>Drosophila</em> all over the world.

The reasons are manyfold:</p>

<ul>
<li>due to the exponential fashion of the amplification (ideally)

<li>reagents degrade, this is especially true for the dNTPs</li>
<li>the activity of the enzyme, despite being heat-stable is declining

"How is membrane capacitance related to the increased speed of saltatory conduction?","14695","","<p><a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8282/why-is-saltatory-conduction-faster-than-continuous-conduction"">Here</a> is the original question which inspired my question. As explained by the answers there, the reason saltatory conduction in myelinated neurons is faster than non-myelinated conduction is because the capacitance of the membrane is lowered by reducing the number of channels (Channel density) or equivalently, increasing the spacing between channels. I also did a preliminary study of membrane electrodynamic modelling <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cable_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Electrical_properties_of_cell_membranes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  </p>

<p>From what I gathered from the linked question, the decreased capacitance overcompensates the effect of absence of channels reinforcing the sodium current, and on the whole, increases the speed of conduction by allowing the depolarizing potential to travel to the adjacent node faster than in case of an unmyelinated fibre.

  nodes"" or allow the depolarizing voltage to ""travel not by ion

  mathematically. This allows us to say that $\lambda$, or the rate of spatial
  decay of potential, increases, decreasing the effective
  length of the neuron. Why should its decrease help faster conduction?)</strong></p>
  
  <p>And another question is, <strong>how would reduced density of sodium voltage
  gated channels cause a decreased capacitance?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Very nice question! I'll go through your three questions sequentially.</p>

<p><strong>Q1: Why does lower capacitance increase ""the effectiveness of nearby nodes"" or allow the depolarizing voltage to ""travel not by ion diffusion, but as an electric field""?</strong></p>

<p>A: Capacitance basically results in sequestering of charge of opposite polarities along the cell membrane, which basically results in a neutralization of charge differences. The effect of this is explained on the website of <a href=""http://amrita.vlab.co.in/?sub=3&amp;brch=43&amp;sim=137&amp;cnt=1"" rel=""nofollow"">Amrita</a> and I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] a higher capacitance results in a lower potential difference. In a cellular sense, increased capacitance requires a greater ion concentration difference across the membrane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What myelin does is insulating the neuron, thereby decreasing its capacitance. You could say that by increasing the thickness of the membrane, the negative insides of the cell do not attract positive charge outside the cell. It's a bit simplified, yet it effectively describes what myelin does (<a href=""http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/teaching/part1a/intro_to_circuits/Capacitors3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">see cambridge web page on capacitance</a>).</p>

<p>So in a myelinated axon, when Na<sup>+</sup> enters the cell in a node of Ranvier, the positive charge entering the cell is not counterbalanced by outside negative charge and hence, the charge is not or at least less counterbalanced. This allows for the depolarizing potential to be transmitted by electric charge. If there were no myelin, the depolarizing potential would fade out pretty quickly along the axon by neutralizing charges outside the cell. Without myelin the opening of more sodium channels in the direct vicinity are necessary not only to transmit the action potential across the axon, but it is also necessary to amplify the signal to prevent it from dying out. In a myelinated axon, hence, the depolarizing potential reaches much farther and in answer to your next question:</p>

<p><strong>Q2:This allows us to say that λ, or the rate of spatial decay of potential, increases, decreasing the effective length of the neuron. Why should its decrease help faster conduction?)</strong></p>

<p>One could say that myelination effectively decreases the length of the axon (the lamba parameter) as the depolaring potential reaches further along the axon.    </p>

<p>The fact that the depolarizing potential reaches further means that voltage-operated sodium channels can be activated at larger distances from a certain depolaring potential. Hence, adjacent nodes of Ranvier can be spaced by as much as 1.5 mm. Due to the fact that the next node is activated by passive spread of an electric field, which is pretty much instant, it skips the intervening distance with about light speed, greatly enhancing conduction velocity. </p>

<p><strong>Q3: And another question is, how would reduced density of sodium voltage gated channels cause a decreased capacitance?</strong></p>

<p>Basically there are no ion channels below a myelin sheath as they are totally useless there. It is the myelin that decreases capacitance and there happen to be no channels underneath.</p>

"Why do ants live so long?","14564","","<p>I was surprised to learn that worker ants in some species live many years. I would have expected a lifespan of a few weeks or months (which is apparently the case for many species).</p>

<p>What factors might account for the length (and/or variation) in ants' lifespans?   (ie, is there some evolutionary preference? Some fundamental limit on the reproductive capacity of the queen?) Is there any relationship between these lifespans and different structures of ant communities? </p>
","<p>There will always be a tradeoff in terms of resource allocation between reproduction and self maintenance. Since worker ants forego reproduction to perform other roles (gathering resources, caring for young etc.) within the colony, it makes sense that this would favour a longer lifespan. This idea works for most animals (i.e. higher reproduction = lower lifespan across species in general) and is well documented (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022191087900606"" rel=""noreferrer"">Partridge <em>et al</em>. 1987</a>, <a href=""http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucbtdag/Gems_1996.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gems &amp; Riddle 1996</a> (PDF link), <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v396/n6713/abs/396743a0.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Westendorp &amp; Kirkwood 1998</a> - to name a few). However the relationship is reversed in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusocial"" rel=""noreferrer"">eusocial</a> animals: the queens of ants, some bees and naked mole rats (which are all eusocial) tend to be longer lived than their sterile workers (<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00254.x/abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hartmann &amp; Heinze 2003</a>). Aging patterns within ants and other eusocial organisms are a very popular research topic at the moment, but the mechanisms causing differences between social castes are not fully understood.</p>

<p>Eusociality is strongly associated with increased lifespan, indeed many studies on the evolution of aging have focussed on eusocial animals which have appeared to overcome aging effects to an extent (<a href=""http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstractBuch&amp;ArtikelNr=22115&amp;ProduktNr=225839"" rel=""noreferrer"">Keller &amp; Genoud, 1999</a>, <a href=""http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/11/1369.short"" rel=""noreferrer"">Buffenstein 2005</a>). The naked mole rat is one of very few species of eusocial mammals and the relationship between its lifespan and body mass is very dissimilar to that of other rodents (ignore the bat points):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zP1Ui.jpg"" alt=""Naked mole rat lifespan vs body mass""></p>

<p>Image from <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720708002888"" rel=""noreferrer"">Buffenstein &amp; Pinto (2009)</a>.</p>

<p>If a queen has a longer reproductive lifespan then over the course of its life it will create a higher number of offspring. This will cause their increased longevity genes to be more prevalent in the gene pool over time - <strong>as long as they are able to reach the limit of their reproductive lifespan and are not killed by externalities (accident or attack) in the meantime.</strong> Therefore this trait (longer reproductive lifespan) will be selected for as long as the queen is protected.</p>

<p>Within eusocial colonies, there is often a protective environment (<a href=""http://sageke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2002/21/pe7#R4"" rel=""noreferrer"">Buffenstein &amp; Jarvis 2002</a>): there is usually a physical structure (nest or burrow); symbiotic bacteria and/or fungi creating a more hygienic microflora; and queens are also protected by other castes. This gives queens a lower incidence of death due to accident or attack which (from the reasoning in the previous paragraph) supports the selection of a longer reproductive life. This is likely to lead to longer lived workers since they share the same genes.</p>

<p>However queens do tend to live much longer than their workers (<a href=""http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/3/269.short"" rel=""noreferrer"">O'Donnell &amp; Jeanne 1995</a>). This is probably due to their reproductive role. All the ants in the colony are investing in reproduction (whether by physically giving birth to young or by providing it with food and protection) therefore the normal relationship (reproduction and lifespan tradeoff) mentioned at the start is not relevant, but since the queen is the only individual reproducing, it will be the only one for whom lengthened lifespan is beneficial evolutionarily.</p>

<p>A mean lifespan of 20 years has been observed in <em>Formica exsecta</em>, and a maximum lifespan of 28.5 years observed in <em>Lasius niger</em>. <em>Pogonomyrmex owyheei</em> has an observed maximum of 30 years, and mean of 17 years.

"Did animals evolve from plants?","14507","","<p>Did animals evolve from plants? Did animals' ancestors have chloroplasts in their cells?</p>
","<p>See this paper ""<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1689654/pdf/10097391.pdf"">Divergence time estimates for the early history of animal phyla and the origin of plants, animals and fungi</a>"" for information on the divergence estimates (I'm not sure if there are more recent papers discussing this).</p>

<p>Plants, animals and fungi are eukaryotes, distinct from eubacteria and archaebacteria, which are prokaryotes. The difference being in the composition of the cell, particularly a nucleus contained within a membrane for eukaryotes, along with other membrane bound organelles, e.g. chloroplasts. They all share a common ancestor, according to this paper, that split 1.576 Bya (billion years ago) +/- 88 Mya (although it states the relationships are unresolved - it is often difficult to resolve relationships so deep in a tree). They form distinct groups known as Kingdoms under Linnaean based biological classification; the Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. Thus, in answer to your question, no, animals did not evolve from plants.</p>

<p>Plants have chloroplasts in their cells, which provide the ability to produce energy via photosynthesis. It is thought that the chloroplast resulted from a symbiotic relationship between early plants and a cyanobacteria in that they both relied on each other for survival and so coevolved. Animals don't contain chloroplasts and instead contain an organelle called the mitochondria (although most plants also have mitochondria), which is also thought to have been a bacterial endosymbiont, probably related to <a href=""http://genomebiology.com/2001/2/6/reviews/1018"">rikettsias</a>. </p>

<p>Protists also contain chloroplasts. The protists are intermediate between all three groups and have been notoriously difficult to classify, being placed into a fourth Kingdom, the Protozoa, although this grouping has been contested. The current Cavalier-Smith system was proposed in 2004 and classifies life into <a href=""http://www.cladocera.de/protozoa/cavalier-smith_2004_prs.pdf"">6 Kingdoms</a>.</p>

<p>Chloroplasts are thought to have evolved from a single endosymbiotic event in Archaeplastida, although there are evidence to suggest some secondary endosymbiotic events. Check out <a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/197"">this paper</a> for more information; figure 1 shows the relationships between the different groups and the endosymbiotic events. The Opisthokonts are the origin of the Fungi and Animalia kingdoms.</p>

Since the group with chloroplasts groups within this clade, it must be the case that either (a) chloroplasts were obtained by an organism that already had mitochondria or (b) chloroplasts were independently lost by multiple lineages within the Eukaryotic clade and then many of these lineages re-acquired chloroplasts by secondary endosymbiosis. Since (a) is a (much) more parsimonious explanation it is the one it makes sense to accept.</p>

"Does the string ""...CATCAT..."" appear in the DNA of Felis catus?","14353","","<p>In Hofstadter's <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</em> (GEB), the following claim appears:</p>

<blockquote>

The reader will perhaps better appreciate this remarkable fact after directly examining the following typical section of the DNA of <em>Felis catus</em>:</p>
  
  <p>...CATCATCATCATCATCATCAT...(<strong>OP note:</strong> truncated because, you get it)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this true? A cursory search for the DNA of <em>Felis catus</em> gives me <a href=""http://cnso.nova.edu/forms/jose_lopez_felismitochondrialgenome_genomics_1996.pdf"">this 1996 paper</a> by Lopez, Cevario, and O'Brien and the given sequence does not appear&nbsp;&ndash; there are some instances of ""CAT"" but not repeated enough to make it as remarkable as claimed in GEB.</p>

<p>I don't know enough Biology to judge the veracity of this claim. Some points I am considering are:</p>

<ul>
<li>GEB is full of wordplays. However, the tone of this part of the text does not sound like one to me.</li>
<li>GEB was written/published around 1978. The paper I linked to&nbsp;&ndash; which was cited by some 236 others according to Google&nbsp;&ndash; was published in 1996, way after GEB's time. If my impression that Lopez et al.'s work is significant because it is the first time <em>Felis catus</em> has been sequenced, then there is no way Hofstadter could've known of it when he wrote GEB. Then again, I don't know enough Biology that there might be some nuance to Lopez et al.'s paper that I'm missing (i.e., the results of the paper might not be mutually exclusive to the claim made in GEB).</li>
<li>GEB has reference notes and bibliography and there is no reference cited to back this claim. However, GEB does not attempt to be a rigorous academic thesis and the references is only called upon more when Hofstadter quotes other works directly while the bibliography is a list of readings which the reader may want to check out, regarding the main thesis of the book.</li>
</ul>

<p>So are cats recursions with no base cases?</p>
","<p>The <em>Felis catus</em> genome has been published, annotated, and updated quite a bit since 1996, including spans of so-called intergenic regions, which are basically scaffolding and other structures, along with perhaps some unidentified genes, pseudogenes, regulatory sequences, etc. Basically, pretty much the <em>entire</em> DNA sequence is available now, not just the gene sequence of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria"">mitochondrial</a> genome, which was what was published in the 1996 paper (mitochondria are the power plants of the cell, but are just an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle"">organelle</a> that happens to contain its own DNA; they are separate from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"">chromosomal</a> DNA in the nucleus). All of this is available for free (if you know where to look) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), part of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States. Other sites are also available, such as <a href=""http://www.ensembl.org"">Ensembl</a>, a joint project between the <a href=""http://www.ebi.ac.uk/"">European Bioinformatics Institute</a> (EMBL-EBI), part of the <a href=""http://www.embl.org/"">European Molecular Biology Laboratory</a> (EMBL), and the <a href=""http://www.sanger.ac.uk/"">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> (WTSI). Both institutes are located on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>So, to the genome. Genomic sequences can be searched in a couple of different ways, depending on what you're looking for, but the most common way is to use BLAST, the Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool. As the name implies, it takes sequences as input and searches one against the other, aligning the results as best as possible using certain algorithms that the user can define and tweak. The BLAST web interface to the cat genome is <a href=""https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&amp;PROG_DEFAULTS=on&amp;BLAST_SPEC=OGP__9685__10703&amp;DATABASE=GPIPE/9685/current"">here</a>. You don't need to worry about any of the other options here except the ""Enter Query Sequence"" box. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format"">FASTA format</a> is just using the single-letter abbreviations for nucleotides (AGCT), all strung together. </p>

<p>The genome we're searching is of an Abyssinian cat named Cinnamon:</p>

<p>To start with, I typed in <code>CATCATCATCAT</code> and to my surprise got back over 200 hits, covering every chromosome the cat has. So, I doubled the length of the input to 8 <code>CAT</code>s, and got back the same result set. Unfortunately, 12 <code>CAT</code>s was too many (and really, it <em>is</em> too many), so I worked backwards.</p>

Apparently, popular wisdom is incorrect, and <em>Felis catus</em> chromosomes really contain 10 <code>CAT</code>s each, one more than is needed for their 9 lives. No word yet as to why this may be, but scientists are presumably working on it.</p>

<p>There are limits to possible distributions of phi and psi angles due to steric clashes between the side chains.

<p>So my question is, do cold-blooded animals generate any heat in their conversion of stored energy (food, fat, etc) into motion?  If they generate heat, why are they cold-blooded?</p>
","<p>They do generate heat. They just do not SPEND energy specifically on heating their bodies by raising their metabolisms. This is a form of energy conservation. The metabolic rate they need to live is not nearly enough to heat their bodies.</p>

<p>An example of spending energy to heat the body is seen in humans  shivering. Here muscle is activated not for its usual purpose, but to function as a furnace. ""Warm-blooded"" and ""cold-blooded"" is somewhat a misnomer. The correct way to think of it is...</p>

<p>Endotherm or ectotherm. Does the heat primarily come from within (endo) or from the surroundings (ecto). Endothermic animals include mammals. Most of their body heat is generated by their own metabolisms. Ectothermic animals include reptiles and insects. They absorb most of their body heat from the surroundings. This is not the same as saying they let their body temperature fluctuate with their surroundings, some avoid this by moving around to accomodate themselves.</p>

<p>Homeotherm or poikilotherm. Homeotherms want to maintain homeostasis for their body temperatures. They don't want it to change. Poikilotherms do not exhibit this behaviour, instead their body temperatures vary greatly with the environment.</p>

<p>We can have endotherm poikilotherms, such as squirrels, who let their body temperature drop while hibernating. Endotherm homeotherms, such as humans, where temperature is constant by means of complex thermoregulation.

","<p>If you are interested in the history of molecular biology this is an interesting question. </p>

<p>Basically transformation came to be used to describe experiments in which the phenotype of an organism was changed by the uptake of DNA, and because of the way this developed in  bacterial systems this DNA was usually a plasmid. Then it became possible to use purified phage DNA to infect cells, whereupon the 'transformed' cells produced phage particles - for obvious reasons this was called transfection. </p>

<p>When efforts turned to getting the same techniques working with cultured animal cells many of the vectors were based on viral genomes (e.g. SV40) and these workers referred to this as transfection. At this point the distinction between the two terms became meaningless, and usage tends to be for historical reasons. Interestingly in molecular manipulations of yeast, where there are no viruses, the transfection word is rarely used.</p>

<li>Is ""species"" still a poorly defined concept? (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species"">Ring Species</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<h1>Short answer</h1>

<p>The concept of species is poorly defined and is often misleading. The concept of lineage is much more helpful. IMO, the only usefulness of this poorly defined concept that is the ""species"" is to have a common vocabulary for naming lineages. </p>

<p>Note that <em>Homo neanderthalis</em> is sometimes (although it is rare) called <em>H. sapiens neanderthalis</em> though highlighting that some would consider neanderthals and modern humans as being part of the same species.</p>

<h1>Long answer</h1>

<p><strong>Are neanderthals and modern humans really considered different species?</strong></p>

<p>Often, yes they are considered as different species, neanderthals being called <em>Homo neanderthalis</em> and modern humans are being called <em>Homo sapiens</em>. However, some authors prefer to call neanderthals <em>Homo sapiens neanderthalis</em> and modern humans <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>, putting both lineages in the same species (but different subspecies).</p>

<p><strong>How common were interbreeding between <em>H. sapiens</em> and <em>H. neanderthalis</em></strong></p>

<p>Please, have a look at <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39664/how-could-humans-have-interbred-with-neanderthals-if-were-a-different-species/40690#40690"">@iayork's answer</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of the post is here to highlight that whether you consider <em>H. sapiens</em> and <em>H. neanderthalis</em> to be the same species or not is mainly a matter of personal preference given that the concept of species is mainly arbitrary. </p>

<p><strong>Short history of the concept of species</strong></p>

<p>To my knowledge, the concept of species has first been used in the antiquity. At this time, most people viewed species as a fixed entities, unable to change through time and without within population variance (see <a href=""http://amazingdiscoveries.org/C-deception-evolution_Plato_Darwin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aristotle and Plato's thoughts</a>). For some reason we stuck to this concept even though it sometimes appears to not be very useful.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Charles Darwin</a> already understood that as he says in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">On the Origin of Species</a> (see <a href=""http://darwin-online.org.uk/Variorum/1860/1860-51-c-1869.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between species and sub-species- that is, the forms which in the opinion of some naturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at the rank of species; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or between lesser varieties and individual differences. These differences blend into each other in an insensible series; and a series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage.</p>

<p><strong>Several definitions of species</strong></p>

<p>There are several definitions of species that yield me once again to argue that we should rather forget about this concept and just use the term lineage and use accurate description of the reproductive barriers or genetic/functional divergence between lineage rather than using this made-up word that is ""species"".</p>

<p>I will below discuss the most commonly used definition (the one you cite) that is  called the <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/side_0_0/biospecies_01"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Biological species concept</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Problems with the definition you cite</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms where two hybrids are capable of reproducing fertile offspring, typically using sexual reproduction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Only applies to species that reproduce sexually</em></p>

<p>Of course, this definition only applies to lineages that use sexual reproduction. If we were to use this definition for asexual lineages, then every single individual would be its own species.</p>

<p><em>In practice</em></p>

<p>In general, everybody refers to this definition when talking about sexual lineages but IMO few people are correctly applying for practical reasons of communicating effectively.</p>

<p><em>How low the fitness of the hybrids need to be?</em></p>

<p>One has to arbitrarily define a limit of the minimal fitness (or maximal outbreeding depression) to get an accurate definition. Such boundary can be defined in absolute terms or in relative terms (relative to the fitness of the ""parent lineages""). If, the hybrid has a fitness that is 100 times lower than any of the two parent lineages, then would you consider the two parent lineages to belong to the same species?</p>

<p><em>Type of reproductive isolation</em></p>

<p>We generally categorize the types of reproductive isolation into post-zygotic and pre-zygotic reproductive isolation (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_isolation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki</a>). There is a lot to say on this subject but let's just focus to two interesting hypothetical cases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Let's consider two lineages of birds. One lineage has blue feathers while the other has red feathers. They absolutely never interbreed because the blue birds don't like the red and the red birds don't like the blue. But if you artificially fuse their gametes, then you get a viable and fertile offspring. Are they of the same species?</p></li>
<li><p>Let's imagine we have two lineages of mosquitoes living in the same geographic region. One flying between 6pm and 8pm while the other is flying between 1am and 3am. They never see each other. But if they were to meet while flying they would mate together and have viable and fertile offsprings. Are they of the same species?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Under what condition is the hybrids survival and fertility measured</em></p>

<p>Modern biology can do great stuff! Does it count if the hybrid can't develop in the mother's uterus (let's assume we are talking about mammals) but can develop in some other environment and then become a healthy adult?</p>

<p><em>Ring species in space</em></p>

<p>As you said in your question, ring species is another good example as why the concept of species is not very helpful (see the post <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11240/transitivity-of-species-definitions"">Transitivity of Species Definitions</a>). <em>Ensatina eschscholtzii</em> (a salamander; see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_isolation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DeVitt et al. 2011</a> and other articles from the same group) is a classical example of ring species.</p>

<p><em>Species transition through time</em></p>

<p>Many modern lineages cannot interbreed with their ancestors. So, then people might be asking, when exactly did the species change occurred? What generation of parent where part of species A and offspring where part of species B. Of course, there is no such clearly defined time in which transition occurred. It is more a smooth transition from being clearly reproductively isolated (if they were placed to each other) from being clearly the same species.</p>

<p><em>Practical issue - Renaming lineages</em></p>

<p>How boring it would be if every time we discover the two species can in some circumstances interbreed, we had to rename them! That would be a mess.</p>

<p><em>Time</em></p>

<p>Of course, when we talk about a species we refer to a group of individuals at a given time. However, we don't want to rename the group of individuals of interest every time a single individual die and get born. This notion yield to the question of how long in time can a single species exist. Consider a lineage that have not split for 60,000 years. Was the population 60,000 years ago the same species as the one today? The two groups may differ a lot phenotypically and may actually be reproductively isolated if they were to exist at the same time.</p>

<p><em>Special cases</em></p>

<p>When considering a few special cases, the concept of species become even harder to apply. </p>

<p>The <strong>Amazon molly</strong> (a fish) is a ""species"" that have ""sexual intercourse"" without having ""sexual reproduction"" and there are no males in the species! How is it possible? The females have to seek for sperm in a sister species in order to activate the development of the eggs but the genes of the father from the sister species are not used (<a href=""http://classic.rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/817.short"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kokko et al. (2008)</a>).</p>

<p>In an ant ""species"", males and females can both reproduce by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">parthenogenesis</a> (some kind of cloning but with meiosis and cross-over) and don't need each other to reproduce. In this respect males could actually be called females. But they still meet to reproduce together. The offsprings of a male and a female (via sexual reproduction) are sterile workers. So males and females are just like two sister species that reproduce sexually to create a sterile army to protect and feed them (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7046/abs/nature03705.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fournier et al. (2005)</a>).</p>

<p><em>Bias</em></p>

<p>It often brings fame to discover a large new species. In consequence, scientists might tend to apply a definition of species that allow them to tell that their species is a new one. A typical example of such eventual bias concern dinosaurs  where many new fossils are abusively called a new species while they sometimes are just the same species but at different stage of development (according to this <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner_shape_shifting_dinosaurs?language=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TED</a>).</p>

<p><strong>So why do we still use the concept of species?</strong></p>

<p><em>Naming</em></p>

<p>IMO, its only usefulness is that it allows us to name lineages. And it is very important that we have the appropriate vocabulary to name different lineages even if this bring us to make a few mistakes and use some bad definitions.</p>

<p><em>The alternative use of the concept of lineage</em></p>

<p>It is important though that we are aware that the concept of species is poorly defined and that if we need to be accurate that we can talk in terms of lineages. The main issue with the term lineage is not semantic and comes about the fact that gene lineages may well differ considerably from what one would consider being the ""species lineage"" as defined by the ""lineages of most sequences""... but this is a story for another time.</p>

<p><strong>In consequence</strong></p>

<p>In consequence to the above issues, we often call two lineages that can interbreed to some extend by different species names. On the other hand two lineages that can hardly interbreed are sometimes called by the same species name but I would expect this case to be rarer (as discussed by @DarrelHoffman and @AMR in the comments).</p>

<p><strong>Homo lineages</strong></p>

<p>I hope it makes sense from the above that the question is really not related to the special case of the interbreeding between the <em>Homo sapiens</em> and the <em>Homo neanderthalis</em> lineages. The issue is a matter of the definition of species.</p>

<p>Vasectomy Procedure cuts only vas deferens, But Our Testes still produces sperm, if there is no output for sperm, where does it go?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>A vasectomy [...] is a contraceptive procedure in men in which the vas deferens, or sperm duct, is cut and the cut ends are sealed in order to prevent the transportation of sperm. Sperm is still produced, but does not leave the body. Vasectomy is usually done as a means of sterilization and is sometimes reversible.<br>
  (from <a href=""http://urology.med.miami.edu/specialties/male-urologic-health/vasectomy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://urology.med.miami.edu/specialties/male-urologic-health/vasectomy</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the vasectomy is complete, sperm cannot exit the body through the penis. Sperm are still produced by the testicles, but they are soon broken down and absorbed by the body. Much fluid content is absorbed by membranes in the epididymis, and much solid content is broken down by the responding macrophages and re-absorbed via the blood stream. Sperm is matured in the epididymis for about a month before leaving the testicles. After vasectomy, the membranes must increase in size to absorb and store more fluid; this triggering of the immune system causes more macrophages to be recruited to break down and re-absorb more solid content.<br>

Sperm is only a small fraction of the total liquid in your semen(almost 4-5 %). The amount of fluid, intensity – even color and texture – does not appear to change when sperm is absent.<br>
  ...<br>
  The body absorbs unused sperm cells normally – whether or not you’ve had a vasectomy. After the procedure, the testicles will continue to produce sperm, but they will not leave the body in the semen. They dissolve and are simply and naturally absorbed by the body.

<blockquote>
  <p>Sperm are produced in the testicles.  They are stored and reach maturation in the epididymis, a tightly coiled, muscular tube that is 15 to 18 feet long and leads into the vas deferens.   The muscle of the epididymis and the vasdeferens contract to propel the sperm through these structures and into the urethra at the base of the penis so the sperm eventually can fertilize an egg.

<p>Sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes, and this does not change. A vasectomy does not affect the function of the testes. It is a physical separation of the vas deferens from each testis, so that the sperm cells cannot be ejaculated. However, the rest of the semen, which is made in the seminal vesicles behind the bladder and which is stored in the prostate, is ejaculated so the male reproductive experience will not change. He can still ejaculate, but there will be no sperm cells in the semen, so there can be no fertilization of an egg cell during intercourse. </p>

"What is the evolutionary advantage of red-green color blindness?","13780","","<p>Red-green colorblindness seems to make it harder for a hunter-gatherer to see whether a fruit is ripe and thus worth picking. </p>

<p>Is there a reason why selection hasn't completely removed red-green color blindness? Are there circumstances where this trait provides an evolutionary benefit?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Color-blind subjects are better at detecting color-camouflaged objects. This <em>may</em> give color blinds an advantage in terms of spotting hidden dangers (predators) or finding camouflaged foods.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
There are two types of red-green blindness: <a href=""http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/types-of-colour-blindness/"" rel=""noreferrer"">protanopia</a> (red-blind) and <a href=""http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/types-of-colour-blindness/"" rel=""noreferrer"">deuteranopia</a> (green-blind), i.e., these people miss one type of cone, namely the (<a href=""http://www.colour-blindness.com/general/how-it-works-science/"" rel=""noreferrer"">red <em>L</em> cone</a> or the <a href=""http://www.colour-blindness.com/general/how-it-works-science/"" rel=""noreferrer"">green <em>M</em> cone</a>). </p>

<p>These conditions should be set apart from the condition where there are mutations in the L cones shifting their sensitivity to the green cone spectrum (<a href=""http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/types-of-colour-blindness/"" rel=""noreferrer"">deuteranomaly</a>) or <em>vice versa</em> (<a href=""http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/types-of-colour-blindness/"" rel=""noreferrer"">protanomaly</a>).   </p>

<p>Since you are talking color-""blindness"", as opposed to reduced sensitivity to red or green, I reckon you are asking about <strong>true dichromats</strong>, i.e., <strong>protanopes</strong> and <strong>deuteranopes</strong>. It's an excellent question as to why 2% of the men have either one condition, given that:</p>

<p>Protanopes are more likely to confuse:-</p>

<ol>
<li>Black with many shades of red</li>
<li>Dark brown with dark green, dark orange and dark red</li>
<li>Some blues with some reds, purples and dark pinks</li>
<li>Mid-greens with some oranges</li>
</ol>

<p>Deuteranopes are more likely to confuse:-</p>

<ol>
<li>Mid-reds with mid-greens</li>
<li>Blue-greens with grey and mid-pinks</li>
<li>Bright greens with yellows</li>
<li>Pale pinks with light grey</li>
<li>Mid-reds with mid-brown</li>
<li>Light blues with lilac</li>
</ol>

<p>There are reports on the benefits of being red-green color blind under certain specific conditions. For example, <a href=""http://vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/MorganAdamMollon1992.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Morgan <em>et al</em>. (1992)</a> report that the identification of a target area with a different <em>texture</em> or <em>orientation pattern</em> was performed better by dichromats when the surfaces were painted with irrelevant colors. In other words, when color is simply a distractor and confuses the subject to focus on the task (i.e., texture or orientation discrimination), the lack of red-green color vision can actually be beneficial. This in turn could be interpreted as dichromatic vision being beneficial over trichromatic vision to <strong>detect color-camouflaged objects</strong>.  </p>

<p>Reports on improved foraging of dichromats under low-lighting are debated, but cannot be excluded. The better camouflage-breaking performance of dichromats is, however, an established phenomenon <a href=""http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/36"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Cain <em>et al</em>., 2010)</a>. </p>

<p>During the Second World War it was suggested that color-deficient observers could often penetrate camouflage that deceived the normal observer. The idea has been a recurrent one, both with respect to military camouflage and with respect to the camouflage of the natural world (reviewed in <a href=""http://vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/MorganAdamMollon1992.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Morgan <em>et al</em>. (1992)</a> </p>

<p><strong>Outlines</strong>, rather than colors, are responsible for <strong>pattern recognition</strong>. In the military, colorblind snipers and spotters are highly valued for these reasons (source: <a href=""http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/colorvisiondefi.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">De Paul University</a>). If you sit back far from your screen, look at the normal full-color picture on the left and compare it to the dichromatic picture on the right; the picture on the right appears at higher contrast in trichromats, but dichromats may not see any difference between the two: </p>

<sup>Left: full-color image, right: dichromatic image. source: <a href=""http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/colorvisiondefi.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">De Paul University</a></sup></p>

<p>However, I think the dichromat trait is simply <strong><em>not selected against</em></strong> strongly and this would explain its existence more easily than finding reasons it would be selected <strong><em>for</em></strong> <a href=""http://vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/MorganAdamMollon1992.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Morgan <em>et al</em>., 1992)</a>. </p>

"What does confluency mean?","13684","","<p>Since as long as I have been doing cell culture, the word confluency is used to describe the % growth of cells or area covered by them. However, no dictionary that I have found uses this word. I was wondering if anyone could reliably state where the meaning comes from or how the association began, and truly what it means. I don't believe I can post this on another stack exchange because the word doesn't have even a resembling meaning in the dictionary. Cell culture is such an integral part of cell biology, medical research and biological manufacturing. And this term is an integral part of cell culture. I was surprised to be unable to reliably verify it's meaning.</p>
","<p>Besides the etymologic explanation that @aandreev gave, in cell culture this term is commonly used to describe the density of adherent cells and it is used as a measure of their proliferation. It is usually combined with an estimated (or counted) percentage, so 10% confluency means that 10% of the surface the dish or flask used is covered with cells, 100% means that it is entirely covered. The cells grow twodimensional on the surface of the flask in this case. The picture below (from <a href=""https://www.mirusbio.com/transfectopedia/methods"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) illustrates different levels of confluency:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qUvoI.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The level of confluency is important as the cells change their growth with changing densities. Low density cells (10-20%) usually grow slower than 50% confluent cells. If the plate is complete grown by cells, they tend to grow much slower again. This influences their genetic program, behaviour in experiments and transfections.</p>

<p>As @Roland pointed out it is important to say that confluency is not a hard measure, but rather an estimate of the cell density. Different people will get different estimations, but the trend should be the same.</p>

","<p>Exercise, such as running, increases muscle activity.  This increases the energy demand of these tissues, which increases the rate of cellular respiration.  Respiration releases heat as a by-product, therefore the body is hotter during and after exercise. </p>

<p>Sweating is a homoeostatic mechanism to keep core body temperature constant. It is a response to lower the body temperature. When the body becomes too hot, sweat is released onto the surface of the skin.  The water from the sweat then takes some of the excess heat energy from the body and uses it to evaporate.  Because water has a relatively large specific heat capacity a lot of heat can be carried away by this method.  </p>

"Supercomputer Vs Human Brain","13674","","<p>With supercomputers doing calculation in petaflops ($10^{15}$ Calculations per Second), have we crossed the speed of Human Brain?</p>
","<p>There's a very big difference between doing the calculations needed to simulate the human brain (or any animal brain - we can do a fairly decent job on <em>C. elegans</em>), and doing computations.  While a basic leaky integrate &amp; fire model is fairly simple, to <em>accurately</em> simulate a single neuron in real time takes a pretty fast computer.  See e.g. these links for more, <a href=""http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/</a>,  <a href=""http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/</a>  <a href=""http://www.artificialbrains.com/darpa-synapse-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artificialbrains.com/darpa-synapse-program</a>.</p>

<p>Brains do well what computers do poorly, and vice versa.  The HP12C calculator on my desk, made in the early '80s, can do many sorts of mathematical calculations faster than I can, because brains aren't really optimized for doing, for example, compound interest calculations.  But my brain, or my dog's brain for that matter, can do all the 'calculations' needed to process a stream of images, recognize that they show a ball, predict its path, and catch it - while simultaneously processing visual, auditory, olfactory, and kinesthetic inputs for obstacle avoidance and threat recognition, and (in my case, anyway) perhaps thinking about how to solve complex programming problems.</p>

<p>Maybe I should add that there are basically three different things that a computer can do in this context:</p>

<ol>
<li>Complex calculations, whether compound interest, weather modeling, seismic tomography or whatever.</li>
<li>Simulating the actual behavior of a brain, or some subset of one, starting from a single neuron.  </li>
<li>Trying to replicate what a brain does through algorithms, or Artificial Intelligence.</li>
</ol>

<p>(1) is what we mostly use computers for, and they're way better at it than human brains.  (2) is a special case of (1), which we do because we don't have much of an idea how to do (3), and having a simulated brain we can alter at will might help in learning how real brains do what they do.</p>

However, I do not understand why enhanced blood circulation would result in a paling of the skin? Do red blood cells actively change direction? </p>
","<p>Red blood cells are not equipped with a motor system to propel them through the blood stream. Instead, they are passively transported through the vasculature by the the pumping action of the heart. The effects of dangerous situations on the skin have to do with hormonal effects on the blood vasculature, and not with direct effects on red blood cells. </p>

<p>Dangerous situations trigger the fight-fright-flight response, and is a direct result of adrenaline being released into the bloodstream. Adrenaline prepares the body to fight for its life. </p>

<p>Adrenaline has a variety of effects including enhancing <strong>perspiration</strong> (or <em>diaphoresis</em>, which prepares the body for the increase in temperature associated with fleeing/fighting), <strong>dilation of the pupils</strong> (which increases light sensitivity, but reduces acuity), <strong>dry mouth</strong> (gastric juices and saliva production decreases because blood flow to the digestive system is decreased), <strong>enhanced smell</strong> and <strong>hearing</strong>, and a <strong>cool, pale skin</strong>.</p>

<p>The cool and pale skin is caused by a reduced blood flow to the surface of the body, while blood flow to the arms, legs, shoulders, brain, eyes, ears and nose can be increased. Besides getting ready to run and fight, the body is preparing to think quickly and be aware of threats by hearing, seeing and smelling things better. Pulling blood away from the skin also helps decrease bleeding from cuts and scrapes (Source: <a href=""http://www.youngdiggers.com.au/fight-or-flight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Army, Navy &amp; Air Force Australia</a>).  </p>

"Does a microwave oven disinfect food?","13612","","<p>Imagine I am preparing food -- just about to put it into a microwave oven --  and some of it falls on the floor. Assuming it got some bacteria or other organisms (viruses?) on it, will the microwave processing disinfect it? What about worm eggs? As I understand, any living organism, given enough exposure to microwaves, degenerates. Is this true?</p>
","<p>Microwave ovens can indeed kill bacteria in food by heating them to high temperatures. For example, <a href=""http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1516-89132005000800010&amp;script=sci_arttext"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> found that microwave heating could kill all of the <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria in a chicken thigh sample:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The effect of microwave heating on Salmonella Enteritidis inoculated
  on fresh chicken was investigated using a microwave oven (800 w) to
  determine the destruction of Salmonella Enteritidis isolated from
  chicken carcasses, in relation to the time of heating at two power
  settings: high (power level 10) and medium (power level 6); The
  relationship between heating time and temperature was also been
  studied. The destruction was 6.4 log cycles at time 95 sec for the
  high power level, and 5 log cycles at time 140 sec for medium power
  setting. After 110 sec for higher power level, no survival of
  Salmonella Enteritidis was detected in samples (100g), but at 140 sec
  for medium power level, these food pathogens were still present.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the main issue is balancing the amount of microwave exposure. Heating the food for too long will result in the food becoming dehydrated or burned, and heating it for too short a period of time will result in food poisoning. </p>

<p><a href=""http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4704840&amp;fileId=S0950268800058350"" rel=""noreferrer"">This paper</a> shows that insufficient microwave exposure can and will lead to food poisoning if there is a large amount of bacteria inside the food:</p>

<p>Is it a physical effect, maybe a protection mechanism from evolution? </p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong>. Why, if one's hands are cold, does it feel as if they are more <em>susceptible</em> to pain?</p>

","<p>For question 1 it's just a biochemical response from thermoreceptor nerves in the skin, temperatures that are likely to cause lasting damage from prolonged exposure cause a neurological response - in this case it's pain.</p>

<p>In address to question 2 it is most likely down to the physiological response of vasoconstriction.</p>

<p>When the body is cold the body undergoes constriction of the blood vessels in the extremities to preserve core temperature where it is more essential for the proper functioning of vital organs. By constricting blood flow to the extremities (in this case the hands) there is less volume of blood present, because of this nerves present in the hand are closer to the surface and thus more sensitive to pain.</p>

"Why can't ciliary muscles in the human eye relax like other muscles?","13592","","<p>I had laser eye surgery a decade ago, but in recent years my eyesight has become significantly myopic. I consulted an ophthalmologist to see if this was eye strain because I work at computers a lot, or part of a natural degradation of the eye over time, or both. My ophthalmologist seems to believe that in my case I'm youngish enough that the natural degradation with age is minimal, and that it's mostly eye strain that is my problem. She believes I can get my eyesight back to roughly 90% of my post-surgery sight ability, if I can reduce eye strain. She gave me some eye drops to help with dryness, and recommended various ways to for me to help my eyes recuperate.</p>

<p>I decided to look into eye strain to learn more about what conditions cause it and what can alleviate it. What I learned is that the lens of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_of_the_eye#Theories_of_mechanism"" rel=""noreferrer"">the eye needs to be flatter to accommodate focusing on far objects</a>, and rounded to focus on near objects. The way the lens becomes flat is by using spring-like connective tissue called <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"" rel=""noreferrer"">choroids</a></em> that pull it taught. Attached to these choroids are muscles called <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliary_muscle"" rel=""noreferrer"">ciliary muscles</a></em> that stretch the choroids out when they contract. This action causes the choroids to stop pulling on the lens, and the lens will retract into a more rounded shape. So, when the ciliary muscles are relaxed, you can see far. When the ciliary muscles are contracted, you can see close up. <a href=""http://www.yorku.ca/eye/ciliary.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">This diagram from the York University website</a> was the clearest explanation I have come across:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tM4cr.gif"" alt=""ciliary muscles and choroids""></p>

<p>Thus, the reason for my current inability to focus on far objects is that so much focusing on close objects, mainly computer monitors, is straining my eyes. In order to regain the ability to focus on far objects, I need to reduce strain and allow the muscles to relax. If they relax, the choroids can pull the eye to the flatter shape needed to see far.</p>

<p>However, I can't reconcile that model with how I understand the mechanics of the other muscles in my body. If I go to the gym and run or lift weights, or in any way expose my muscles to work, they respond by getting stronger without sacrificing the ability to stop contracting. The muscles in my body don't lose the ability to relax, no matter how much I train them. I have never heard of anyone who worked out too hard or too long such that their bicep would remain in a permanent state of contraction.</p>

<p>In fact, in my experience, after a hard workout, it's <em>impossible</em> to prevent my muscles from relaxing and resisting doing more work. When I do a bicep curl at the gym, and I do it to the point that I can't lift the weight anymore, my muscle gives up and I drop the weight. Similarly, if I've spent a long time looking at close up objects, shouldn't my ciliary muscles give up, allowing the choroids to take over, making clear far vision the unavoidable outcome?</p>

<p>The idea that my ciliary muscles need to relax in order to see far also seems to contradict my personal anecdotal experience. Sometimes I am able to see far away, but I can't hold it for more than a few seconds. If I try to maintain focus on far objects for too long, I get an uncomfortable feeling in my eyes that is hard to describe, but it's a form of pain that forces me to give up. My vision goes blurry, and I can only see close objects again. If my bicep worked the same way, it would be as if it hurt to let my arm hang straight down with a weight, and the only way to alleviate it would be to raise the weight, which makes no sense. I feel like the effort is in seeing far, and that when I'm tired, I can only see close up.</p>

<p>It's not that the case that I think that all medical research on the eye has it backwards, it must be that there is some aspect of this that I am not seeing (pun intended).</p>

<p>How can it be that the ciliary muscles, unlike other muscles, lose their ability to relax?</p>

<p>Why is it that my ciliary muscles don't become exhausted and allow the choroids to take over by default?</p>
","<p>First of all, I should correct some points that were misunderstood. 
Don't change the question because this will lead to confusion.</p>

<p>""The way the lens becomes flat is by using spring-like connective tissue called choroids that pull it taught.""</p>

<p>In classic ophthalmology you don't need to think about choroid in direct relation to accommodation: choroid is a sponge-like layer between the sclera and retina and in general it is consisted of blood vessels. The anterior part of the choroid continues anteriorly to became a ciliary body which in turn contains ciliary muscle - one circular muscle per eye. From the ciliary body/muscle spread zonules (zonule fibers) and they are fixed on the lens equator. </p>

<p>Physiology: contraction of <strong>ciliary muscle</strong> causes <strong>zonules</strong> to became loosen and <strong>""free"" the lens</strong> to became more convex and move the focus anteriorly (<em>not choroid contracts itself</em>). If the ciliary muscle relaxes then zonules are tighten up and the lens consequently becomes more flat (less convex) moving the focus posteriorly. In other words you can say it in the terms of depth of focus - convex lens gives less depth, less convex gives more depth of focus.</p>

<p>Thus, the classical choroid layer does not perform any action (look at your choroid related link - there are almost nothing about accommodation).</p>

<p>""Permanent state of contraction"" can be physiological (=normal) as well as abnormal one, and it is very common in some conditions (muscles spasms). One example is priapism, where corporal smooth muscle contraction causes permanent and dangerous penile erection which can be medical emergency (priapism is by far more complex, so take the explanation like a metaphor). </p>

<p>If we refer to ""accommodation spasm"" there is analogy to ""muscle spasm"" (and partially to priapism), but I should state we believe that spasm of ciliary muscle exists - since we don't see it directly. Probably (and take this sentence as speculation, since I cannot give you reference right now) the causes of this is not a muscle spasm itself, but the state of zonular fibers which cannot come back to their base state. I like the example with iron rod - if you will contract it fast and many times, at some point it can be ""loosen"" as well as fractured (and probably it does happens to zonules too). Probably (I say ""probably"" to underline the point we do not exactly know this), the ""accommodation spasm"" is partially misname and in future the investigations will clarify that.</p>

<p>Probably, you will learn some interesting facts from definition of ""pseudoexfoliation"" syndrome, but I do not explain it here because it is not related directly to the question. From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoexfoliation_syndrome"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki</a> ""has been known to cause a weakening of structures within the eye which help hold the eye's lens in place, called lens zonules""</p>

<p>Another example for analogy for continued ""spasm"" is the situation when one should care something heavy for a long distance without releasing the grasp - finally one can get not only spastic contraction but also severe ischemic damage to the fingers. </p>

<p>Considering your case, you should know about pathological (degenerative) myopia where the eye expands posteriorly and consequently the focus is before the retina which should be corrected by minus lenses. It is well known fact that myopic eyes have longer axial length then normal eyes. Probably, it is your case.</p>

<p>So, as you can see, the answer to your question is not a clear cut, but assumption. The ciliary muscle does can relax, but probably the problem is more complex then only ciliary muscle related issue.</p>

<p>PS The image you reposted is a little bitconfusing one and is not exact. This one is classical and gives better understanding of the anatomy - </p>

<li><strong>Apomorphy</strong> -- any character state or trait novel to a species and its descendants.

<p>I understand that proton gradient is from stroma to thylakoid space, but that does not mean stroma would have less protons than thylakoid space, if stroma would have a higher pH, then the proton will never flow from stroma to thylakoid space, right?</p>
","<p>Energy from an electron transport chain is used to actively transport protons from the stroma to the thylakoid lumen. Thus the lumen has a relatively higher proton concentration and therefore a lower pH than the stroma.</p>

<p>Higher $[H^+]$ means lower pH.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the flow of actively transported protons from the stroma to the lumen is against their concentration gradient. There wouldn't be a net flow of protons this way without active transport.</p>

<h2>Plant cells</h2>

<p>They are often square shaped/rectangular because it is easier to build a ""<em>brick wall</em>"" (cell wall) out of rectangular bricks.  Any structure that minimises interstitial space will hence allow more ""life"", thus possibly making it stronger. </p>

<p>This is also due to: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Plant cells are not necessarily square, but they due tend to have distinct edges and be somewhat rectangular. This structure is caused by the cell wall which is very rigid and therefore forces the cell to have a defined shape.</p>

<p>Then the wikipedia article on <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord#Physiological_postnatal_occlusion"" rel=""nofollow"">umbilical cord</a> explains what happens briefly after birth, and only touches on it becoming part of the circulatory system.  What does it actually do in later life, as part of that system?</p>
","<p>The umbilical cord, which contains the umbilical arteries and vein so important for nutrient, oxygen and waste transport before birth, becomes useless pretty much the moment the lungs start working (the kidneys already started before birth). As the baby breathes, the two arteries constrict to stop flow from the newborn to the placenta. The Wharton's Jelly, a structural element in the cord, causes collapse of the vein on cooling to outside temperature. Within a matter of a few minutes, the whole system is shut down.</p>

<p>Within the infant, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus (which carried blood to the liver and the inferior vena cava) close up and degenerate into fibrous remnants known as the round ligament of the liver and the ligamentum venosum respectively. The round ligament basically just divides the left part of the liver into medial and lateral sections. The ligamentum venosum does basically the same thing on the posterior surface of the liver. Both ligaments maintain their attachment to the umbilicus. (The small paraumbilical veins are unimportant except in the case of severe portal hypertension, where they act as a portacaval anastomosis.)</p>

<p>The parts of the arteries closest to the navel degenerate into what are known as the medial umbilical ligaments (which basically serve no purpose whatsoever and are buried in the abdominal wall), while the more internal remaining sections are retained as part of the circulatory system as the umbilical artery. </p>

<p>The umbilical artery in adults is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. The umbilical artery is found in the pelvis, and gives rise to the superior vesical arteries (supplying the superior part of the bladder, and parts of the ureters. In males, it also gives rise to the the deferential artery which supplies the ductus deferens.</p>

","<p>Biological examples similar to programming statements:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>IF</code> : Transcriptional activator; when present a gene will be transcribed. In general there is no termination of events unless the signal is gone; the program ends only with the death of the cell. So the <code>IF</code> statement is always a part of a loop.</li>
<li><code>WHILE</code> : Transcriptional repressor; gene will be transcribed until repressor is not present.</li>
<li>There are no equivalents of <code>function</code> calls. All events happen is the

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>Molecular biological processes cannot be directly compared to a computer code. It is the underlying logic that is important and not the statement construct itself and these examples should not be taken as absolute analogies. It is also to be noted that DNA is just a set of instructions and not really a fully functional entity (it is functional to some extent). However, even being just a code it is comparable to a HLL code that has to be compiled to execute its functions. See <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29663/can-dna-rna-be-considered-as-natures-programming-language"">this</a> post too.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the cell, like many other physical systems, is analog in nature. Therefore, in most situations there is no 0/1 (binary) value of variables. Consider gene expression. If a transcriptional activator is present, the gene will be transcribed. However, if you keep increasing the concentration of the activator, the expression of that gene will increase until it reaches a saturation point. So there is no digital logic here. Having said that, I would add that switching behaviour is possible in biological systems (including gene expression) and is also used in many cases. Certain kinds of regulatory network structures can give rise to such dynamics. Co-operativity with or without positive feedback is one of the mechanisms that can implement switching behaviour.

","<p>There are about 100 <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10824/"">(Purves, 2001)</a> to 400 <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33394/"">(Zozulya <em>et al</em>., 2001)</a> functional <strong><a href=""https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ordb/"">olfactory receptors</a></strong> in man. While the total tally of olfactory receptor genes exceeds 1000, more than half of them are <a href=""http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/12/11/the-smell-of-evolution/"">inactive pseudogenes</a>. The combined activity of the expressed functional receptors accounts for the number of distinct odors that can be discriminated by the human olfactory system, which is estimated to be about 10,000 <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10824/"">(Purves, 2001)</a>.</p>

<p>Different receptors are sensitive to subsets of chemicals that define a “<a href=""http://michaeldmann.net/mann8.html"">tuning curve</a>.” Depending on the particular olfactory receptor molecules they contain, some olfactory receptor neurons exhibit marked selectivity to particular chemical stimuli, whereas others are activated by a number of different odorant molecules. In addition, olfactory receptor neurons can exhibit different thresholds for a particular odorant. How these olfactory responses encode a specific odorant is a complex issue that is unlikely to be explained at the level of the primary neurons <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10824/"">(Purves, 2001)</a>. </p>

<p>So in a way, the answer to your question is yes, as there are approximately 100 to 400 olfactory receptors. Just like the photoreceptors in the visual system, each sensory neuron in the olfactory epithelium in the nose expresses only a single receptor gene (<a href=""http://www.biology-pages.info/O/Olfaction.html"">Kimball</a>). In the visual system for color vision there are just three (red, green and blue cones - RGB) types of sensory neurons, so it's a bit more complicated in olfaction.</p>

"What is the difference between Founder effect and Bottleneck effect?","13204","","<p>Both are examples of genetic drift in which there is a change in the allele frequency when the population size becomes small.
What is the difference between the two?</p>
","<p><strong>Genetic drift is an EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS</strong></p>

<p>Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia > Genetic Drift</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Genetic drift (also known as allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a> after biologist Sewall Wright) is the change in the frequency of a gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms.</p>

<p>I think that these terms are used without a perfect semantic. An obvious case </p>

<p><strong>A population bottleneck is a DEMOGRAPHIC EVENT</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A population bottleneck [..] is a sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental events (such as earthquakes, floods, fires, disease, or droughts) or human activities (such as genocide)</p>

<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.genetics.org/content/167/3/1041.long"" rel=""nofollow"">Provine 2004</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “founder” principle, as introduced by Mayr in 1942, was an auxiliary mechanism (less important than random drift) for producing reduced variability in an isolated population started by a few individuals or even by a single fertilized female. Mayr saw a distinction between the “founder” effect and random drift. The founders were not a random sampling of the main population, but, once isolated as a small population, would undergo random drift</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, a founder effect does NOT refer to the ppulation bottleneck causing by a founding event. A founder effect refers to the increase in genetic drift (loss of genetic diversity is expected) caused by a founding event. A founding event is the event by which few individuals (eventually only one) quit a large population to settle down a new small populations. As such, a founder event is a type of population bottleneck. I think that one could further extrapolate the term ""founder effect"" to any increase in genetic drift caused by a population bottleneck.</p>

<p><strong>Do all authors use the same definitions?</strong></p>

<p>I have not done a good literature review to answer this question but I would not be surprised if different authors, use slightly different definitions.</p>

<p>For example, some authors (e.g. <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05635.x/epdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Peery at al 2012</a>, <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/90/8/3172.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Raymond and O'Brien 1993</a>, <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/89/13/6015.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Duarte et al. 1992</a>) have used the term ""genetic bottleneck"" instead of ""population bottleneck"". Wikipedia indicates that these two terms are synonyms. However I could not find any paper that formally define the term genetic bottleneck but all the papers using this term seem to be specifically interested into the genetic signature of population bottleneck. As such, the semantic relationship between population bottleneck and genetic bottleneck could be the same as between founding event and founder effect. Genetic bottleneck could be defined as the increase of genetic drift that is caused by population bottleneck.</p>

"Which blood vessel carries the most impure blood?","13187","","<p>There is a question in my Biology textbook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Which blood vessel in the human body carries most impure blood after
  few hours of meal.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is given as <em>Renal artery</em>.</p>

<p>But I think the answer should be <em>Hepatic Vein</em>, because the liver produces urea and other waste materials and then it pours it all in the right ventricle of the heart for oxygenation. And then the heart distributes the blood to various parts of the body. So the impure blood brought by the Hepatic Vein and other blood vessels gets distributed through the aorta. This will automatically imply that the Renal Artery will contain <em>lesser</em> impure blood than the Hepatic Vein.</p>

<p>Impure blood is the blood with urea, uric acid and other components of urine.</p>

<p>It would be good if you give your opinion and also a reason for it.</p>
","<p>It's the renal artery because it will contain everything from the liver as you describe <em>plus</em> all waste accumulated on the way from the liver to the kidney. Here it gets filtered, so there cannot be a place after the kidney that is less ""pure"".</p>

"What is the function of E-coli bacteria in our stomach?","13165","","<p>So, I recently came up with this question. I  googled it, but couldn't understand the proper functions of E-coli bacteria. A little definition would be wonderful.</p>
","<p>Nonpathogenic E.coli are a component of the gut microbiome of humans and many other organisms. </p>

<p>They are commensals, meaning that when they remain in the areas they have evolved to live in, and when they do not acquire virulence factors, they are benign. They live in our digestive tract and basically do nothing to harm us.</p>

<p>In fact, commensal microorganisms like E.coli can be considered part of the multicellular organisms innate immune system. They take up space on the exposed surfaces of internal organs such as the intestines and prevent the colonization of pathogenic strains of microorganisms. </p>

<p>Along with the endothelial cells and mucous, commensals form the barrier defenses that are the first line of protection against pathogenic organisms. Basically they are the good neighbors that don't cause problems and they don't leave space for bad neighbors to move in.</p>

<p>Problems can occur if they gain access to areas that are normally sterile. If the intestine is perforated and E.coli gain access to the thoracic cavity, they can become an opportunistic pathogen, as they will not be interacting with the host in a way that can control their proliferation. They can also come in contact with cells that are not expressing the necessary proteins to protect them from the E.coli.</p>

<p>You can also end up with the situation where a pathogenic bacteria or a bacteriophage carrying a virulence factor can transfer that virulence factor to the commensal E.Coli, turning them pathogenic.</p>

<p>But for the most part E.coli are there to take up space that could otherwise be colonized by harmful bacteria.</p>

","<p>During the time when you are not drinking water you still loose some water to sweating and urine. Sweating is (especially in hot climates) an important function of the body to maintain the body temperature in desired range. If this water is not replaced, the body gets dehydrated.

<p>so in short are sperms living or non-living</p>
","<p>The question of what is living is nothing but a matter of definition. We can only tell you what are the standard definitions of what is a living thing but no absolute truth exist behind these definitions. Therefore, I am afraid that all discussions here will bring anything new to your ethic or religion related discussion.</p>

<p>I want to argue that the @user137's answer is very misleading for two reasons. First, he based his discussion exclusively on the ""reproduction ability"" definition of life. Second because his definition of reproduction might be misleading as well.</p>

<p>Reproduction is not only cell division obviously. Following this same definition one would not consider a human to be a living things but only to be a collection of living (and non-living) things. It is important to understand that a spermatozoid is just one phase of a life-cycle. This phase yield to the next phase. That's it. It seems weird to say that a kid is not alive just because he cannot reproduce. It seems weird to say that a grandmother is not alive because it cannot reproduce. You can say however that a kid is a living thing that cannot reproduce and at another moment of its life cycle it will be able to reproduce (assuming it will survive to this age). One should not think of spermatozoids as something totally detached from the human phase as we know it. These things just form a cycle and it seems to me miseleading to say that a part of this cycle is not alive. Saying such thing would yield someone to think that two living things create non-living things that by fusion will become alive. That seems weird. But again, it is nothing but a matter of definition. I cannot say that user137 is wrong, I cannot only say that his definition seem neither useful, intuitive nor common among biologists.</p>

<p>You may want to have a look to life-cycle and to understand what are the haplontic and diplontic phases with a bunch of wikipedia readings.</p>

<p>Other concepts such as the ability to synthesize its own components, having a boundary between interior and exterior and ability to response to environmental stimulis are often used in order to define what is a living thing and what is not.</p>

"What is the biological function of nose hair?","13035","","<p>What is the biological function of nose hair? In general, can we consider underarm hair and pubic hair to be vestigial structures?</p>
","<p>From <a href=""http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-purpose-of-nose-hair.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> I quote </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hair in the nose is one of the body's first lines of defense against
  harmful environmental pathogens such as germs, fungus, and spores.</p>
  
  <p>Another purpose for nose hair is to provide additional humidity to the
  inhaled air. As the air passes through the nasal passages, the mucus
  and hair provide heat and moisture. Humidity is an important factor
  for the rest of the respiratory system, such as the larynx and lungs.</p>
  
  <p>Hair in the form of tiny cilia also draw solid particles towards the
  interface between the nose and throat. Harmful debris is generally
  directed towards the back of the throat and esophagus for swallowing,
  while the filtered air continues towards the larynx and lungs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you look on an evolutionary perspective, the arm pit hair follicles as well as pubic hair have a type of sweat gland associated with them, called an apocrine gland, that begins to function at puberty and is widely associated with scent-communication via chemicals known as pheromones (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocrine_sweat_gland"" rel=""noreferrer"">reference</a>).</p>

<p>Some other functions that are associated with pubic hair are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keeping the genitals warm.</li>
<li>Drawing attention to the genitalia.</li>
<li>It also decreases friction during intercourse (<a href=""http://www.doctoroz.com/blog/lauren-streicher-md/bare-necessities-what-you-should-know-grooming-your-pubic-hair"" rel=""noreferrer"">reference</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The nose hair is definitely not vestigial. As long as the armpit hair (between the body and arm in certain heavyset individuals) and pubic hair serve to reduce friction and male sweat serves to increase female hormones, I wouldn't call them vestigial (<a href=""http://news.cnet.com/Study-Male-sweat-causes-female-hormones-to-rise/2100-11395_3-6157161.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">reference</a>). </p>

<p>Specifically, the biggest gains will be seen with cross-sectional area (feel free to ask why on physics.stackexchange.com) and neurons with myelin sheathes (fat wrappings which affect saltatory conduction rates).</p>

If I'm wrong, somebody please correct me.</p>

<p>On average non-voluntary reflexes (which is actually information going to the CNS, being processed, and then going out to the motor neurons) take about 0.3 seconds. However, the average human can blink in about 0.1 seconds, which is probably a better measure.</p>

","<p>The pH of stacking and resolving gel are set in such a way that one is above and one is below the pI of gly (5.97).Therefore, Gly has two different charges in stacking and resolving gel. That is in stacking gel gly has no charge (which will allow the protein to stack according to size in this part of the gel rather than separating because of presence of gly in between the protein molecules, constraint in separation of proteins) but in resolving gel charge is negative since the pH is higher (constraint in movement of proteins no longer present so separation of protein based on size possible).</p>

"What is the purpose of using two layers of gel in SDS- PAGE?","12935","","<p>I just made a SDS-PAGE with a top layer of stacking gel and a bottom layer of separating gel with different pH values of 0.5M Tris-HCl. The stacking was 6.8 and the separating gel was 8.8. What about this pH change makes the gels different? What effect does this have on the proteins that I ran? </p>
","<p>The stacking gel concentrates proteins loaded into the sample wells so that they are resolved as a unified ""line"" once they enter the stacking gel.  The reason for the lower pH is that this ""lower ionic strength implies higher electrical resistance and consequently a higher electric field, provoking the faster movement of the proteins and of every other charged particle in the gel. Such a high electric field coupled with the glycine in the running buffer (that will not go into the resolving gel due to the pH), helps to clean the sample from the Cl- ions from the Tris-HCl buffer. That concludes in a stack of clean, denatured, and equally charged proteins in the boundary with the resolving gel; this will account for a good quality PAGE.""</p>

<p>Bassically, in the stacking gel the pore size is larger so it gives a chance for the larger proteins and smaller proteins to equalize with each other.  </p>

<p>""As the proteins are denatured and linearized by heating, SDS and dithiothreitol (if there is any di-sulfide bond), the proteins are loaded onto the wells on the stacking gel. The denatured proteins have a uniform mass to negative charge ratio. Since the current run from negative (top) to positive (bottom), the proteins move toward the bottom. When the electricity is turned on, the proteins and Tris-glycine enter the stacking gel. In stacking gel with pH 6.8, the N-terminal amino group of the proteins and amino acids are protonated at equilibrium which makes them less negative. The average electrophoretic mobility is very slow. A Gly-chloride ion boundary is formed since glycine moves slower than chloride ion. However, glycine still runs slightly faster than other proteins. As a result, the glycine keeps pushing the protein towards the chloride ion. In other words, the proteins are trapped between glycine and chloride ion. The proteins form a very tight band inside the stacking gel. </p>

<p>Once the protein reaches the resolving gel, the pH changes from 6.8 to 8.8 and the pores are smaller. As pH increases, the N-terminal amino groups are deprotonated. Amino acids and proteins are more negatively charged at equilibrium than in stacking gel. As a result, glycine moves faster than proteins. Glycine and chloride ions move ahead of the proteins. As the pores are smaller in the resolving gel, the size of the protein determines the mobility (speed). So the smaller the protein is, the faster it will reach the bottom.""</p>

<p>I imagine they normally hide in trees or under other kinds of cover. But for migratory birds, I don't think it is possible to hiding under cover until the rain passes. There might not be any cover (trekking across seas) or it might stay rainy for a very long time (and therefore cold...).</p>

<hr>

<p>I did some research, but the answers are conflicting. Some people say they do stay in trees, others say they AVOID trees (because trees can snap in a storm, plus if there's lightning then sitting in a tree will net fried birds). Then there's people saying that birds have a waterproof coating... but that's a bit contradictory with me not seeing birds when it rains.</p>

<p><strong>So where do birds go when it rains?</strong></p>

<p>I assume that different bird species and groups of birds will behave in different ways. I am interested in the case of migratory birds because they are likely to encounter different climates and have perhaps devised strategies to be safe. I would appreciate any well-referenced examples.</p>
","<p>Obviously, as you point out, some birds, such as waterbirds (ducks, puffins, auks, sandpipers) are perfectly fine in the rain, as they spend much of their time in the water anyhow and have oil glands that waterproof their feathers. </p>

<p>For other birds, rain can increase heat loss. For instance, rain increases metabolism by up to 22% in eagles (<a href=""http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1942594"">Stalmaster &amp; Gessaman, 1984</a>), although the actual impact on average daily metabolism was 'negligible'. However, eagles were able to feed their offspring only half as much, and therefore had only half as many eaglets, when it rained (<a href=""https://sora.unm.edu/node/54147"">Elliott et al., 2005</a>). (On the other hand, the authors point out that in the Tropics, eagles actually do better when it rains because there is more food available).</p>

<p>Migrating birds stop migrating, hide where they can, and wait until it dries up before they continue (<a href=""http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=13709895"">Erdi et al, 2002</a>); those that don't, often end up far away from where they should be and, eventually, dead.

","<p>By brain cells, I'll assume you mean neurons (the other type are called glial cells). Yes, new neurons arise in a least certain parts of the brain, and yes, they do cause memories to weaken or disappear. This has been shown in mice, guinea pigs and degus.</p>

<p>It would be wrong to assume that neurogenesis occurs with the frequency of, say, gastric cell or skin turnover. Up until recently, it was not thought to occur at all.</p>

<p>Learning and remembering use various cortical structures, including the hippocampus.Throughout life, new neurons (neurogenesis) are continuously added to the dentate gyrus. These additions remodel hippocampal circuits, and when this occurs after memory formation, this neurogenesis leads to degradation or forgetting of established memories. This was shown in adult mice. Conversely, decreasing neurogenesis after memory formation decreased forgetting.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p>It is not only plasticity that makes the brain adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands. Adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing. Adult neurogenesis itself is a type of circuit plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.<sup>[2]</sup> </p>

<p>The more neurogenesis there is, the more memories are broken down. Since we retain many memories over our lifetime, it's pretty safe to say out brains don't ""turn over"" every five years (or even over longer periods); some parts of our brain don't seem to undergo neurogenesis at all.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

"Why do plants have green leaves and not red?","12470","","<p>I know plants are green due to chlorophyll.</p>

<p>Surely it would be more beneficial for plants to be red than green as by being green they reflect green light and do not absorb it even though green light has more energy than red light.</p>

<p>Is there no alternative to chlorophyll? Or is it something else?</p>
","<p>Surely it would be even more beneficial for plants to be black instead of red or green, from an energy absorption point of view. And <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell"" rel=""noreferrer"">Solar cells</a> are indeed pretty dark.</p>

<p>But, as Rory <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/451/303"">indicated</a>, higher energy photons will only produce heat. This is because the chemical reactions powered by photosynthesis require only a certain amount of energy, and any excessive amount delivered by higher-energy photons cannot be simply used for another reaction<sup>1</sup> but will yield heat. I don't know how much trouble that actually causes, but there is another point:</p>

<p>As explained, what determines the efficiency of solar energy conversion is not the energy per photon, but the amount of photons available. So you should take a look at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight#Composition"" rel=""noreferrer"">sunlight spectrum</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_Spectrum.png"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Solar Radiation Spectrum""><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Solar_Spectrum.png"" alt=""Solar Radiation Spectrum""></a></p>

<p>The Irradiance is an energy density, however we are interested in photon density, so you have to divide this curve by the energy per photon, which means multiply it by λ/(hc) (that is higher wavelengths need more photons to achieve the same Irradiance). If you compare that curve integrated over the high energy photons (say, λ &lt;&nbsp;580 nm) to the integration over the the low energy ones, you'll notice that despite the atmospheric losses (the red curve is what is left of the sunlight at sea level) there are a lot more ""red"" photons than ""green"" ones, so making leaves red would waste a lot of potentially converted energy<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Of course, this is still no explanation why leaves are not simply black&nbsp;— absorbing all light is surely even more effective, no? I don't know enough about organic chemistry, but my guess would be that there are no organic substances with such a broad absorption spectrum and adding another kind of pigment might not pay off.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p><sup>1)</sup> Theoretically that <em>is</em> possible, but it's a highly non-linear process and thus too unlikely to be of real use (in plant medium at least)<br>
<sup>2)</sup> Since <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water"" rel=""noreferrer"">water absorbs red light stronger than green and blue light</a> deep sea plants are indeed better off being red, as Marta Cz-C <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/450/why-do-plants-have-green-leaves-and-not-red#comment-469"">mentioned</a>.<br>
<sup>3</sup>  And other alternatives, like the semiconductors used in Solar cells, are rather unlikely to be encountered in plants...</p>

"Why are the Galápagos islands so special?","12420","","<p>Why did Darwin formulate his theory of evolution just after his visit to the Galápagos islands? Why were they so special from an evolutionary point of view?</p>
","<p>Charles Darwin formulated his theory after travelling the world aboard the Beagle, here's <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Voyage_of_the_Beagle.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">the route</a>. He found the Galapagos Islands particularly inspiring, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'The natural history of this archipelago is very remarkable: it seems
  to be a little world within itself.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a more detailed account of his relationship with the Galapagos islands, and there is also a book called ""Voyage of The Beagle"" (I think it is available as a free kindle download) which is basically his diary. </p>

<p>A big part of the reason it is so famous is because of ""Darwin's Finches,"" which are 12 species of finch on the island that have all evolved to specific niches. This is one of the classic examples of evolution. Darwin noted the differences between the birds, thinking they were of different families, but it was later discovered they were all finches and the differences had evolved because of factors like the food they eat (seed eaters had fatter beaks.. etc). </p>

<p>The Galapagos islands offer opportunities to study evolution and adaptation because the islands are distant from the mainland, have differences between the islands, and migration between the islands is difficult. Studies like <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/2460995?seq=1"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> (which I happened to be reading at the time of the question being asked whilst writing a manuscript) are an example of how cool a place it is!</p>

"Why is it that heterozygous loci appear as two separate bands during gel electrophoresis while homozygous loci appear as one band?","12380","","<p>Is it because heterozygotes have a greater base pair length? (And if they do, why is that?) Or is it because recessive alleles are moving slower than the dominant alleles in the gel?</p>
","<p>A heterozygous locus has two different alleles and therefore it is possible that their DNA sequence lengths are different. However, it is unlikely that they are so different so as to be clearly resolved in a gel electrophoresis. Agarose gels can at best resolve 20bp; polyacrylamide gels can resolve smaller differences but it is only done for small DNA fragments.</p>

<p><em>I think upto 50bp difference is possible between alleles. But such huge insertions/deletions are rare and the difference between the alleles is usually a point mutation or small insertions/deletions(indels). Big indels are possible when a transgene is inserted specifically in one chromosome; these cases are mostly experimental.</em></p>

<p>If you consider paralogs as alleles then they can be of different lengths and can be resolved in agarose gels— usually the difference is in the untranslated regions. If you are doing Southern blot and using a probe that can bind to both paralogs then you will end up getting two bands. </p>

<p>Having said that, it is possible to see a difference in gel bands even if there is no size difference. This is possible by a technique called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"" rel=""nofollow"">RFLP</a>. In this technique the DNA is digested using a restriction enzyme which basically cuts the DNA at a specific sequence (usually a hexamer). If a point mutation abolishes or creates a restriction site then the fragment length would be different between the alleles. This is detectable on the gel.</p>

"How long will norovirus live?","12337","","<p>I hope this is the right place to ask. I subscribe to several Stack Exchange threads, and regard them as the best internet forum for genuine and credible answers.</p>

<p>I spent last evening talking to friend, at an Amateur Radio Club, who told me he has recently recovered from the norovirus. I was demonstrating an oscilloscope to him, and he also handled the handbook. All this is now in the holdall I used to carry it to the Club. I took all the precautions I could, like washing my hands and not getting them near my lips, nose etc. So, my question is: how long should I wait before opening my holdall, to be sure any infection there is dead?</p>
","<p>Well, for him the virus is already likely at minimum levels within his body. If he's recovered (pass the fever phase) then his immune system has already dealt with the majority of the viral bodies in his system, since the peak of the immune response comes after the peak of the viral infection density (<strong>ignore B</strong>):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCfJi.jpg"" alt=""graph from Nature Review: Immunology""></p>

<p>How much of the virus was left in his system to actually spread is hard to guess. Sometimes infections never <em>truly</em> go away, but merely become undetectable by conventional testing. However, if we're to assume that there's at least <em>some</em> norovirus left to transfer to you then you should realize that the greatest chance for exposure has already come and gone.</p>

<p>The moment you were in the same room together, talking in close proximity, shaking hands (if you did), or generally being <em>close</em> is the most likely source of any infection you could have picked up. However, while most virii don't survive well outside of the body, the norovirus notably bucks that trend. <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDUQFjAA&amp;url=http://hawaii.gov/health/environmental/sanitation/sanitationguidelines/norovirus.pdf&amp;ei=5-XmUNGRHsGCrAGTs4EY&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqsczlYE_k6RQO8EO1RGp9uD7kBw&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.aWM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Hawaiian Department of Health (PDF)</a> notes that the virus can definitely survive outside the body for several days on hard surfaces (though it will <em>not</em> grow), can survive being frozen, and that it only takes about 100 viral units to cause an infection (which could fit a few thousand times over on a grain of salt). <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/artful-amoeba/2012/01/17/misery-inducing-norovirus-can-survive-for-months-perhaps-years-in-drinking-water/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scientific American</a> also notes that norovirus can survive for <em>months or years</em> in sources of drinking water.</p>

<p>What you've already done is pretty much what you should do to avoid infection. You've washed your hands, refraining from mucous membrane contact, etc.</p>

<p>Ultimately how long you should wait depends on where the norovirus currently resides. A week should be sufficient if all of the norovirus is contained on the book or on other surfaces that you're not making contact with. However, if it's already had contact with your skin or mucous membrane, then you're either already fighting it off or you're about to become ill. Unfortunately it's a lot easier to expose yourself than contain something you can't see, as the <a href=""http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/flu-fiction-minimyth.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mythbusters have done a good job of showing (Video)</a>.</p>

<p>In all likelihood if he was still infected enough to transmit the virus to other people by the time you two started handling the same equipment and you didn't use gloves, you've probably been exposed. However, exposure doesn't automatically mean you get sick. If you're not sick within a week afterwards, you've successfully fought it off. So, congratulations, perhaps!</p>

"How do warm-blooded animals keep their temperatures constant?","12243","","<p>Warm blooded animals like us keep their temperature constant irrespective of their surroundings. But how do they do that? Energy should be supplied from the inside. I assume that reactions like making ATP from glucose are exothermic. That means in winter our body reacts more. Water is absorbed by those reaction.We should need more water in winter. Which is contradictory with our real life experience.</p>

<p>On the other hand what prevents cold blooded animals from making heat? Don't they need ATP? Do they use different types of reactions to make energy? Do they have different evolutionary path? They don't seems very different from us.</p>
","<p>Since there seems to be several distinct sub-topics in your question, I will answer them one-by-one:</p>

<p>1). There are a variety of mechanisms that allow endothermic animals to maintain thermal homeostasis in a cold environment. The main ones are:</p>

<p>a). The shivering response: When the core body temperature of a endotherm drops below a critical value (36.8C in humans), it causes the posterior hypothalamus to stimulate certain skeletal muscle groups (especially around vital organs) to start to ""shiver"" rapidly, generating heat.</p>

<p>b). Compared to ectotherms, endotherms have more mitochondria per cell, thus allowing them to have a higher metabolism. Since metabolism always generates heat, an [general] increase in cellular metabolism will cause an increase in body heat.</p>

<p>c). Many endotherms have layers of insulating matter, such as fur, blubber, feathers…etc, allowing them to preserve body heat. In addition, endotherms can also route blood away from  capillaries via vasoconstriction of arterioles, reducing the area in which heat can be lost.</p>

<p>d). As mentioned by Memming, brown adipose tissue also plays a role in temperature regulation. Thermoregulation-based metabolism in brown fat causes the P+ in the electron transport chain to go through thermogenin instead of ATP synthase. This process generates heat, but no ATP.</p>

<p>e). Some endotherms, such as penguins and arctic wolves have countercurrent exchange in their capillaries. This is when warm arterial blood ""passes"" some of its heat to cooler veinous blood. This feature allows some of the heat normally ""wasted"" into the air to be recycled back into the body.</p>

<p>Note: Though it is true that endotherms are able to keep their body temperature constant irrespective of their surroundings (ignoring extremes), they do this at a cost of requiring significant amounts sustenance. Most endotherms require much more sustenance than ectotherms.</p>

<p>2). Your second sub-question is very interesting. Though it is true that generating heat will require substantial amounts of carbohydrates/fats/...etc, it does not necessarily mean that the net consumption of sustenance in cold environments is greater than that in normal environments. In most cases, endotherms in cold environments will have exhibit significantly less activity than when in an optimal environment. The decrease in activity when in a cold environment will likely balance out the increase in thermo-regulation based metabolism. This likely explains why people tend to drink equal or slightly less amounts of water when in cold environments. One more thing: some reactions heat-generating reactions (like the alternate ETC pathway) do not require water. Glycolysis and Krebs actually generates water (not to say that there is a net gain in the body :))</p>

<p>3). In truth, nothing ""prevents"" ectotherms from generate heat. They simply do not have the cellular ""machinery"". Ectotherms metabolize in ways very similar to other organisms, using molecules like ATP, glucose, fat…etc. Unlike endotherms however, they spend very little of their energy on temperature regulation. As a consequence, their overall metabolic rates are dependent on the external temperature. The point is this: A substantial portion of endotherm sustenance is used to generate heat. Only a small (if any) portion of ectotherm sustenance is used to regulate heat. As a result, endotherms require much more nourishment than ectotherms.</p>

<p>4). I am not entirely certain what you mean by ""evolutionary path"", but I will just say this: In many ways, endotherms and ectotherms are organisms that have found different ways to the same problem; how to regulate body heat for maximal survival and reproduction. Basically, </p>

<p>ectotherm- more dependent on environmental temperature, requires less sustenance</p>

<p>endotherm- less dependent on environmental temperature, requires more sustenance</p>

<p>5). You are quite correct. The cellular and genetic components are very similar. Some morphological aspects seem to be shared as well.</p>

"How is ATP involved in muscle contraction?","12154","","<p>The sliding filament mechanism as explained by my text does not elaborate on how ATP is involved in the cross bridge binding and contraction process. How does muscle contraction utilize ATP?</p>

<p>In my text explains this is the procedure for a contraction:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ach released by motor neuron cross cleft and binds to motor end
plate</li>
<li>AP generated in response to binding of Ach gated channels and propagates down T tuble</li>
<li>T tuble triggers Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum</li>
<li>Ca2+ binds onto tropinin on actin filament and removes tropomyosin</li>
<li>This opens up sites for myosin to attach to actin using protein heads</li>
<li>Actin filament is pulled toward the center of sarcomere, causing contraction</li>
</ol>

<p>I see that the action potential definitely needs ATP in order to be generated, aside from that I am surprised that the actual contraction via cross bridge binding does not seem to need ATP. </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>ATP prepares myosin for binding with actin by moving it to a
  higher-energy state and a ""cocked"" position.</p>
  
  <p>Once the myosin forms a cross-bridge with actin, the Pi disassociates
  and the myosin undergoes the power stroke, reaching a lower energy
  state when the sarcomere shortens.</p>
  
  <p>ATP must bind to myosin to break the cross-bridge and enable the
  myosin to rebind to actin at the next muscle contraction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DKp2c.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The muscle contraction cycle is triggered by calcium ions binding to
  the protein complex troponin, exposing the active-binding sites on the
  actin. As soon as the actin-binding sites are uncovered, the
  high-energy myosin head bridges the gap, forming a cross-bridge. Once
  myosin binds to the actin, the Pi is released, and the myosin
  undergoes a conformational change to a lower energy state. As myosin
  expends the energy, it moves through the ""power stroke,"" pulling the
  actin filament toward the M-line. When the actin is pulled
  approximately 10 nm toward the M-line, the sarcomere shortens and the
  muscle contracts. At the end of the power stroke, the myosin is in a
  low-energy position.</p>
  
  <p>After the power stroke, ADP is released, but the cross-bridge formed
  is still in place. ATP then binds to myosin, moving the myosin to its
  high-energy state, releasing the myosin head from the actin active
  site. ATP can then attach to myosin, which allows the cross-bridge
  cycle to start again; further muscle contraction can occur. Therefore,
  without ATP, muscles would remain in their contracted state, rather
  than their relaxed state.</p>

"What's the minimum distance of focus for the lens of a human eye to reach maximum flatness?","12118","","<p>According to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_%28eye%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on eye accomodation</a>, the range in which a human eye can focus is from 7 centimetres away up to essentially an infinite distance. Of course, people can't see things an infinite distance away, but at a certain point the light reflected off an object will come at the eye in effectively parallel paths.</p>

<p>As an eye focuses on objects progressively farther away, it seems to me there would be a point when the lens hits maximum flatness, after which it everything will be equally sharp in focus. Looking at an object 500 metres away or 1000 metres away probably doesn't require any change in the lens. However, going from one metre away to seven requires the ciliary muscles adjust to just the right amount.</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>what is a normal minimum distance from the eye at which the lens will reach maximum flatness?</strong> Everything else in this question is just for context, so an answer to this, stated in metres from the eye, is all I am seeking.</p>

<p>The article I linked to above mentioned the human eye seeing ""13 dioptres"", and I have tried to understand <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diopter"" rel=""noreferrer"">dioptres</a>, but it's a little confusing for me. If I understand correctly, the higher the dioptre, the closer you focus, so the 13 dioptres refers to how close the human eye can see. If I have this backwards, please let me know.</p>

<p>In any case, my purpose in asking is to determine the range in which ciliary muscles would be required to do more nuanced work in order to hold the lens at in the right shape. Focusing on something 7 centimetres away, the ciliary muscles are at maximum exertion, and at a certain point and beyond the ciliary muscles are completely relaxed. To hold somewhere in between would require more subtly nuanced, and, I suspect, more difficult work on the part of the ciliary muscles.</p>

<p>At least, I assume that to be the case because I am hypothesizing that the act of contraction for the ciliary muscles would be similar to other muscles. For example, it is easier to do a bicep curl with weight when going from full resting position to maximum contraction, as opposed to stopping at a particular spot somewhere in the middle of the motion. To stop mid-motion requires more muscle control, and, depending on how fast you wanted to do it, can be difficult to be exact.</p>
","<p>There are practical questions in ophthalmology and you've asked someone that has a common theoretical answer: 6 meters. </p>

<p>However, you should know that from the same theoretical point the far the object the less accommodation we need, so the second answer is - infinity. </p>

<p>What is the difference? From the practical point the accommodation between this two points is negligible and does not have to be taken into account when we correct the refraction error.</p>

<p>Small theory - to see an object placed at a distance of 1 meter we need 1D of accommodation power (1/1meter=1D), to see an object placed at a distance of 30cm we need 3D of accommodation power (1/0.3meter=3D), for an object at a distance of 10cm we need 10 diopters and finally for an object at the distance of a 6 meter we need accommodate 0.16 diopter. </p>

<p>Thus between 6 meter and infinity the accommodation is very low and this is why the distant visual acuity is checked at this distance. Consequently, the lens convexity difference between 6 meters gaze and infinity is negligible and this is why the answer to your question is between 6 meters and infinity (zero accommodation).</p>

<p>From this explanation you can calculate the dioptric add for any reading distance  and understand how the reading spectacles correct the loss of accommodative power (=presbyopia, the vision of older people).</p>

<p>If you want to know how much the crystalline lens changes its dimensions during accommodation, the answer is near 7% for diameter and near 10% for thickness, so the lens as was convex, stays convex and the visible changes are minimal.</p>

"Why is the heart not in the middle of the body?","11981","","<p>All mammals that I can think of have a high degree of bilateral symmetry (In fact, almost every animal I can think of is like this).</p>

<p>So why is the human heart not exactly in the middle of the body? An effect of this is that one lung is slightly smaller. Are there any evolutionary theories on why this came to be?</p>
","<p>First of all, let me make it clear that the heart <strong>is</strong> at the vertical centre of the body -- it is not shifted towards left (or right). However, it is slightly <em>tilted</em> towards the left in most cases. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/myYcl.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/myYcl.jpg"" alt=""heart location""></a></p>

<p>In some cases, it is tilted towards the right, and the condition is called <em>Dextrocardia</em>. For why it is so, lets look at what the heart does. Below is a diagram of double circulation (from <a href=""https://circsystemsunsig09r3b.wikispaces.com/%28e%29%09+Comparing+human+circulation+system+with+other+species"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>).</p>

<p>As you see, the highest pressure needs to be generated for pumping oxygenated blood into the body. Thus, the left ventricle needs the thickest muscles for this purpose. And due to these extra muscles, the  heart appears extended and seems shifted towards left.</p>

<p>Coming to the evolutionary perspective, it is important to mention that humans are not the only organisms with this feature. Indeed, displacement of the heart towards the left is a conserved feature in all vertebrates (<a href=""http://dev.biologists.org/content/124/11/2099.abstract?ijkey=98ffa089b81e8ed19fd71a9f7d8a9521e2a20e18&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fishman <em>et al</em>, 1997</a>). See <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/9011"">this</a> answer for more information.</p>

<p>Coming to genes, bending of the heart towards one side is actually controlled by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NODAL"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>NODAL</em></a> gene during development. See this diagram (from <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488912002868"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jensen <em>et al</em>, 2013</a>):</p>

<p>Tilting occurs in two phases, one during the first four and a half months of intrauterine life and the other, which is actually a 45° rotation to the median plane, later. During the early development of the heart, a process called cardiac looping happens and the straight heart tube develops a bend (see diagram). The NODAL gene, along with the <a href=""https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/13590.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lefty1</a> and <a href=""https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/320202.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lefty2</a> genes, regulates the speed and direction of cardiomyocyte movement during the development of the heart, leading to this asymmetry. To confirm it, researchers knocked out the <em>spaw/nodal</em> gene from a zebrafish and found randomized development of heart, even symmetric heart, as the result(!) (see <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC491794/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Walmsley, 1958</a> and <a href=""http://fast.wolterskluwermedical.demdex.net/dest5.html?d_nsid=0#http%3A%2F%2Fcircres.ahajournals.org%2Fcontent%2F102%2F2%2Fe12"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rohr <em>et al</em>, 2008</a>).</p>

<p>Now, talking about why this happened in the first place, and why it is so conserved among vertebrates, we need to ask ourselves a basic question: <em>what good would a symmetrical heart be?</em> External symmetry is preferred (probably) because it helps in locomotion; it would be quite difficult to move with your two legs placed away from your center of gravity. But when we talk about internal symmetry, conditions drastically change. We get a major restrictive factor here: space. And limited space always dominates other factors. Seeing that the structure of the heart is necessarily pointed towards one side, it becomes difficult to make it symmetrical. (The only option IMO is to have another pointed end at the right side.) In this case again, what advantage would a symmetrical heart provide? None. And it might even be harmful since having an even bigger heart would mean making both lungs smaller. Thus, a symmetrical heart would only prove to be a liability rather than an asset. See <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/5588"">this</a> question for more information.</p>

"Why do kefir grains stop growing in soy milk?","11977","","<p>Kefir is a fermented milk drink made with kefir grains. It usually is prepared by inoculating cow, goat or sheep milk with kefir grains.</p>

<p>I would like to prepare the drink with soy milk, which worked fine for some months. Then the kefir grain stagnated in its growth. I use bottled soy milk from the supermarket. I do not produce the soy milk by myself.</p>

<p>In ""real"" milk the kefir grains never stop growing (and dividing), but in soy milk they apparently do.</p>

<p>Why do the kefir grains stop growing in soy milk? Are they lacking a specific nutrient that is only contained in milk from animals?</p>
","<p>Animal Milk. The ideal environment for Kefir Grains is animal milk. Varieties include cow, goat, sheep, and other similar species. Kefir Grains thrive in animal milk due to the chemical makeup of the liquid. The lactose in animal milk provides the most efficient food source for the Kefir Grains and therefore the most efficient and effective culturing process. </p>

<p>Alternative Milks. While animal-based milks are the healthiest for the Kefir Grains, alternative types of “milk” (coconut, soy, rice, nut, etc.) can also be used under certain conditions. Generally speaking, Coconut Milk, Soy Milk, and Rice Milk can be cultured using Kefir Grains as long as a revitalization period is observed (see below). While some people report success culturing Kefir Grains in seed and nut milks (e.g. hemp milk, almond milk, etc.), these varieties tend to yield more inconsistent results.
Revitalization Period. When using a non-animal variety of milk, it is important to occasionally allow the Kefir Grains to revitalize in animal milk for 24 hours. </p>

<p>We recommend allowing the Kefir Grains a revitalization period at least once every few weeks and ideally more often. To revitalize the Kefir Grains, simply place the Kefir Grains in 1-2 cups of animal milk for 24 hours. Once the process is complete, the Kefir Grains can be returned to use with an alternative variety of milk.</p>

As far as I know, red blood cells and blood platelets are the only <em>human</em> cells in our body without a nucleus.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Erythrocytes and thrombocytes are the <strong>only <em>human</em> cells</strong> without a nucleus, as far as I know. However, if you count the gut as being part of the human body (in essence it is a continuation of the skin and as such it can be considered to be on our <em>outside</em>), then we are <em>loaded</em> with cells lacking a nucleus, namely all the bacteria that live in our intestines such as <em>E. coli</em>. Bacteria, being prokaryotes, lack a nucleus. In fact, there are ten times more bacteria than human cells in our gut <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-humans-carry-more-bacterial-cells-than-human-ones/"" rel=""nofollow"">(Wenner, 2007)</a>.</p>

"On which strand does the promoter sit?","11845","","<p>My book keeps giving different indicators as to whether the promoters are on the coding or template strand.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It says the -35 region in prokaryotes must be on the coding strand. It also mentions, that the -10 and -35 regions are binding sites for RNA polymerase.</p></li>
<li><p>It also says that CAAT and GC, unlike -35 in prokaryotes, can also be on the template strand. Which implies that they are still most common on the coding strand. And then it shows me a figure, where a promoter sequence is shown in the template strand, with the transcription complex attached.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All the sequences are written 5'-TATAAA-3' (for example). This also implies they are on the coding strand, since the template strand will then be 3'->5' which is the direction that transcription happens in.</p>

<p>Obviously I'm confused, and hope someone can clarify this. In which strand can I find the promoters? Does stuff act on the promoter sequence itself, or its complementary sequence? If the promoter can also be on the other strand, should it be reversed?</p>
","<p>The answer to this question depends upon the definition of the word 'promoter'.</p>

<p>In the simplest possible model of prokaryotic transcription the promoter is the site where RNA polymerase binds to the DNA before initiating RNA synthesis. In this process the &sigma; factor recognises the core promoter elements directing the polymerase to bind to the DNA to form the closed complex. The next step is the switch to the open complex involving separation of the DNA strands.</p>

<p>Articles describing investigating the interaction of the &sigma; factor with the DNA (e.g. <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1995.0531"">here</a>) refer to the protein making contacts with base pairs. I conclude therefore that the original question doesn't make sense - a promoter is a dsDNA entity even though we might describe it in terms of the sequence on one or other of those strands. So, for example, in a promoter the consensus -35 sequence - 5'-TTGACA -  would be present on the coding strand (upstream of the coding sequence), but the promoter property of the sequence is due to the presence of this sequence and its complement on the other strand.</p>

"Do bacteria die of old age?","11815","","<p>I know that the cells of mammals at least stop dividing when they are old, and then die a programmed cell death. Then other cells have to replace them. </p>

<p>But in a bacterial colony, each cell replicates for itself. Obviously, if a division of a bacterial cell of generation N were to produce two new cells of generation N+1, and all bacteria died of old age at generation M, there would be no bacteria left around. </p>

<p>So how is it regulated in bacteria? Are their divisions simply unlimited? Does a cell never die and just divide forever? </p>
","<p>This is a interesting question and for a long time it was thought that they do not age. In the meantime there are some new papers which say that bacteria do indeed age.</p>

<p>Aging can be defined as the accumulation of non-genetic damages (for example oxidative damage to proteins) over time. If too much of these damages are accumulated, the cell will eventually die.</p>

<p>For bacteria there seems to be an interesting way around this. The second paper cited below found that bacteria do not divide symmetrically into two daughter cells, but seem to split into one cell which receives more damage and one which receives less. The latter one can be called rejuvenated and seems to make sure that the bacteria can seemingly divide forever. Using this strategy limits the non-genetic damage to relatively few cells (if you consider the doubling mechanism) which could eventually die to save the others.</p>

"Examples of animals with 12-28 legs?","11790","","<p>Many commonly known animals' limbs usually number between 0 and 10. For example, a non-exhaustive list:</p>

<ul>
<li>snakes have 0</li>
<li>Members of <em>Bipedidae</em> have 2 legs. Birds and humans have 2 legs (but 4 limbs)</li>
<li>Most mammals, reptiles, amphibians have 4 legs</li>
<li>Echinoderms (e.g., sea stars) typically have 5 legs.</li>
<li>Insects typically have 6 legs</li>
<li>Octopi and arachnids have 8 legs</li>
<li>decapods (e.g., crabs) have 10 legs</li>

(Isopod, picture from wikipedia)</p>

<p>You also need to define 'legs' for the discussion to be meaningful. As you say, decapods have 10 legs on their thoracic segments (thoracic appendages), but they can also have appendages on their abdomens (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapod_anatomy#Abdomen_.2F_Pleon"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pleopods</a>/swimming legs), which will place many decapods in the 10-20 leg range.</p>

<p>So overall, in Arthropoda, having 12-28 legs doesn't seem all that uncommon. There are probably other Arthropod groups besides those mentioned here that also have leg counts in this range.</p>

<p>However, for a general account, the most likely answer (if there is indeed a relative lack of 12-28 legged animals) is probably evolutionary contingencies and strongly conservative body plans within organism groups.</p>

We had some interesting suggestions from the FDA (since the FDA pays attention to these type of discussions). To get proper mixing, it is often not considered enough to merely swirl a tube a bunch.

The spore is formed during unfavorable conditions, by duplication of the bacterial chromosomes, and consequent envelopment by various membranes and protective coatings (while still within the original cell). The spore is dormant and remains so as the outer cell degrades during harsh conditions, releasing the spore. I guess I'd call the spore a clone of the original?</p>

<p>You may enjoy reading the relevant sections in this <a href=""http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=book&amp;func=displayarticle&amp;art_id=68"" rel=""nofollow"">book</a>, which go into greater detail.</p>

<p>edit: as Souvik has pointed out, this is only one type of ""protective"" spore. Actinomycetes also form spores, via differentiation of the cells, and cyanobacteria form akinetes also via differentiation (but this structure is not as durable as endospores).</p>

<p>Information about cyst formation is difficult to find, but in bacteria it appears to develop via changes in cell wall composition.</p>

"What decides whether a lysogenic cycle or a lytic cycle will take place?","11532","","<p>A virus can either participate in a lysogenic cycle or a lytic cycle. What decides that?</p>
","<p>It depends on a few factors, such as how many phages infected the cell, whether or not the cell is in good growth conditions, and so on. If the cell is in stress or has low amounts of nutrients, the lysogenic pathway is typically activated.</p>

<p>The underlying mechanism has to do with a protein cascade involving either the cro or cI protein that is encoded by the virus. The cI protein is a repressor, and it will prevent the lytic genes from being transcribed. By default the virus will transcribe the lytic genes, so they must be repressed for lysogeny to occur. Similarly, cro is also a transcriptional repressor. The two proteins work in opposition to each other. cro binds to an operator, oR3, that is involved in repressing cI, which may prevent cI from being expressed and thus preventing it from repressing lytic genes (however the importance of this is debatable because if you replace oR3, the cell can apparently still lyse).</p>

<p>There are numerous other proteins, such as N and Q, that are involved. The N protein has to be transcribed by the polymerase ‘anti-terminating’, or reading through a termination signal. This will happen more frequently when the protein RNase III is present at high concentrations. The N protein is a lytic regulator. Thus, when there are high amounts of RNase III there will be more N expressed which leads to the lytic cycle. RNase III is not a viral protein. It is a host protein and the host expresses more of it when nutrients are abundant. This is how the virus is able to ‘sense’ if nutrients are high enough to enter the lytic cycle.</p>

<p>The whole system is way more complicated but this is it in a nutshell.</p>

"What is the contribution of the cockroach to the ecological environment?","11527","","<p>I've read a lot about cockroaches but was unable to find how they contribute to the ecological environment. Does anyone know?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Cockroaches are an integral part of the food chain. </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Cockroaches are an important <strong>source of food</strong> for a number of organisms, such as arthropods, birds, and mammals. As such, they are an important part of the food chain. Cockroaches also play an important role in <strong>nutrient recycling</strong>. Most species of cockroach are <strong>detritus feeders</strong> and with the help of endogenous cellulases play an important role in degrading plant material. Some species, such as <em>Cryptocercus</em>, feed directly on wood and play a major role in lignocellulose digestion in temperate forests.</p>

"Why does scar tissue change color?","11494","","<p>I was wondering why, when you are cold, scar tissue turns bluish or purple while original skin stays the same color.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of, is that maybe scar tissue gets less circulation than regular skin, so when it gets cold it restricts circulation.</p>
","<p>The main mechanism behind the scar changing its color is the dilation of blood vessels within the scar tissue. The dilated vessels lead to the congestion of blood flow. The red blood cells moving more slowly leave more oxygen due to its diffusion to the tissue and the hemoglobin -- the oxygen holding protein -- changes its color from scarlet (bound to oxygen) to cyan (released/bound to CO<sub>2</sub>). Since scars are not covered by skin, the blood vessels are clearly visible here and you see this characteristic color.</p>

<p>The triggering mechanism here is cold that increases the energy barrier for many biochemical reactions, first of all those required for smooth muscle contraction. </p>

<p>Cold-induced vessel dilation (that can be seen, for example, on cheeks and extremities) with mild circulatory disturbances ultimately undergoes into so-called cold vessel paralysis when smooth muscles of blood vessel walls completely loose their ability to contract and are maximally dilated. The cyan color of the scar is usually seen at the very last stage, that can occur unexpectedly quickly because scars do not have any warmth insulation layer compared to the regions covered by skin.</p>

"How to obtain bacteria samples at home?","11476","","<p>As the <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/9180/948"">original question</a> went from hold to closed, I thought I would write up a more appropriate question.</p>

<p>How should one go about getting bacterial samples to look at under a microscope at home?  How do professionals do it?  What if I want to look at cool pathogenic species like Salmonella bongori, Escherichia coli, or Bacillus anthracis?</p>
","<p>First, and I cannot stress this enough, you should not go seeking out human pathogens if you don't have the appropriate equipment to handle it at the right <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level"" rel=""noreferrer"">safety level</a>.  That goes for all pathogens, even ones you might find around your house.</p>

<p>In a professional lab, you might get samples from collaborators, clinical samples, vendor, or really an number of other professional resources.  A well respected vendor as an example is <a href=""http://www.atcc.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ATCC</a>, but the general public wouldn't be able to ""shop"" there.</p>

<p>But you really don't need to go far to get a whole host of microbes to study, you can grow them all at your house.  The basics of bacteria culturing can really be broken down to three steps: (1) get a source of bacteria, (2) put some of the bacteria in an environment where they can grow easily, and (3) harvest them to do something useful with them. </p>

<p>(1) Is fairly easy, bacteria are everywhere.  You can swab nearly any surface of anything in your house and come up with microbes (note you might also get some mold/fungi).  In this case (3) is easy as well.  Once you have culture you can streak it across a slide to view it under a microscope (you could also use several proper mounting techniques).  After all, looking at microbes under a microscope is the real goal here!</p>

<p>The only part of this plan that will take some real elbow grease is making your own culture dishes at home, but it's not as hard as you might think.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Making your own culture dishes:</strong></p>

<p>1) The ""plates"" themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I recommend getting the smallest Tupperware like containers your can
  find that are microwave safe, dishwasher safe, and really make a good
  seal (water tight at the least). They really don't have to be big, and
  you will make your life easier if you buy a bunch to match. They need
  to be super clean. After running them through your dishwasher at home,
  put them all in a boiling pot of water until you are ready to pour in
  your ""medium."" A mid-low simmer will work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that you won't probably be able to have perfect sterile technique at your house, but you should try to do what you can.</p>

<p>2) Your ""Medium"" or Broth</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I highly recommend using pectin as your gelling agent if you can't get
  your hands on some agar. After that comes plain unflavored gelatin,
  but I recommend pectin. You can get it at almost any grocery store and
  my recipe is made assuming that. You can determine how much you want
  to make, just scale up the ratios. I'm going to list things as rough
  volume by volume so you won't need a scale.</p>
  
  <p>i) Make the powder first:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>45mL of pectin;</p></li>
  <li><p>4 bouillon cubes ground as finely as you can (you can get different
  types and results depending on if you start with vegetable, beef, or
  chicken. I recommend starting with vegetable.);</p></li>
  <li><p>125mL of refined white sugar;</p></li>
  <li><p>Additives (more on this later)</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>ii) Mix the powder into 500mL of water.</p>
  
  <p>Before you mix in the powder, heat the water to 50-75<sup>o</sup>C (mid low heat), but not boiling. Mix the powder in while stirring until
  dissolved.</p>
  
  <p>iii) Bring the mixture up to a boil. Let it boil for about 2 min,
  stirring all the while.</p>
  
  <p>iv) Cover the pot and let it cool for 4-5 min.</p>
  
  <p>You by no means want it to cool down to room temperature, you just want
  to get it a little below boiling. If you are at 55<sup>o</sup>C or below it's
  definitely time move on.</p>
  
  <p>v) Dip/fill your ""plates"" 1/3 full of media using clean/sterile
  utensils and seal while hot but not boiling.</p>
  
  <p>You may have noticed this seems an awful lot like canning, and that's
  because it is. Again you want to be as clean as possible in this step
  and of course try not to burn yourself on anything.</p>
  
  <p>vi) Let your media plates set and chill over night in the
  refrigerator.</p>
  
  <p>You really probably only have to wait a few hours if you are anxious
  to get going. You are going to want to store the plates that you are
  not using in the refrigerator anyway. Also if you made a bunch of
  plates, let the cool on a counter before you put them in the fridge so
  that you don't raise the temp of your fridge too much.</p>
  
  <p>Remember the thing about additives? You can play around with adding
  different amounts and different types of salts, vitamins, food, or
  other items to see how they affect the cultures you get to grow. All
  kinds of fun there. First go round, leave them all out.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Now you have your own home made culture plates! The above recipe was empirically tested by my childhood, and repeated by my son's. Not all pectin from the store may be equal, this is with Ball Classic (I have no relation to the company). I'd love to know people's results in trying it, because I might need to re-think how/what I'm doing to get it to work.</p>

<p>Go around your house swabbing things with sterile swabs (you can get these at a drug store), and then streak them out on plate. While it will be a little different with a swab and homemade plate, the idea is similar to what is done <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAm21yPGMRo"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Leave your plate in a warm wet place, but not in direct sunlight. Ideal temp is going to be around 37, but you can leave them above and below that and still get things to grow. On top of our dryer is where I leave them.</p>

<p>After a day or so you should have colonies you can streak out on a slide and look under a scope. You will find all kinds of things this way. If you want a more formal way to put things on a slide, you can check out dry and wet mounting from a Google search.</p>

<p>You are actually quite likely to run into E.coli if you sample enough ""areas"" this way. Obviously don't eat or huff the stuff that ends up growing. Maybe you can post some fun pictures of this if you try it.</p>

<p>As pointed out in the comments, if you successfully get bacteria to grow, then you will need to successfully get rid of them.  I should point that a good set of rubber gloves (that you can bleach and wash after use), or disposable gloves are a really good idea when handling plates that have grown bacteria.</p>

<hr>

<p>Clean Up</p>

<hr>

<p>First off, I want to clearly say that this stuff can clog a pipe.  </p>

<p>If you tried to grow something on a plate, and you didn't get a colony that you can see with the naked eye (note some microbes might make CLEAR growths) you can <em>probably</em> just scoop the gel into the trash.</p>

<p>Note that I said <em>probably</em>.  If you swapped any part of your body, waste, or that of an animal you <strong>must</strong> decontaminate even if you didn't see anything grow.  On the plus side decontamination is easy.</p>

<p><strong>If you did see something grow, or you otherwise need decontamination:</strong></p>

<p>First make a 20% bleach solution in a large Tupperware like container (probably don't want to do this is a nice metal pot, but could do it in a junk one).  You can go as low as 10% bleach solution if you sure your bleach is NOT a cheap already watered down brand (like something bought at dollar store).  But just to be sure, I recommend 200mL of bleach in 800mL of plain tap water.</p>

<p>Drop your plates and lids into the bath (with the lid off) and let it sit for 10-15 min.  Then, working under/in the bleach solution with your gloves on, use a fork/spoon to get out the medium (it will be like thick jello).  Do this for all your plates, and you can do more than one at a time this way.</p>

<p>Once you have all the medium out and floating in the bleach, take the plates out and put them in the dishwasher.  Strain out the bleach/medium/funkiness you grew through a cheap colander (I recommend dishwasher safe plastic like PP).  Put what get's caught in the colander in the trash and take the trash out.  Wash the plates, lids, colander, and large container you used for the beach bath.</p>

<p><strong>Slides</strong></p>

<p>Slides present extra caution because they can break or shatter to create sharp edges.  For the most part, if you cover your sample with a cover slip, and seal it with nail polish, you can actually keep your slides indefinitely with little risk.  If you do decide to dispose of them, they should first go into a thick Ziploc bag (use an expensive freezer guard type bag for this) or into a Tupperware you don't mind throwing away.  If you never sealed your sample to your slide, you should also decontaminate the slide in bleach first (as above, with extra caution to not cut yourself).</p>

<p>If you are sophisticated enough to get microscopic photos of the microbes you see, by all means post them up and we'll try to ID them as best we can (many look very similar, and we use genetic or protein markers to get a true ID).</p>

"How do ants know where they are going without eyes?","11413","","<p>I know that ants have some sense of direction, but what is the physiology behind this sense?</p>
","<p>Well, first off, they have eyes, so there's that.</p>

<p>However, a lot of what ants wish to achieve can be done through a combination of a random walk and chemical trails.</p>

<p>When ants are exploring their surroundings, they are essentially wandering about without much in terms of a sense of purpose; laying down a chemical signature as they go.</p>

<p>When they find something interesting, like food, they use their own chemical trail to backtrack, laying down a new chemical trail indicating the nature of what they have discovered, making a kind of smell-road from the hill to the point of interest.</p>

<p>Any ants that subsequently come across this trail follow it, and subsequently join in transporting the food back to the hill.</p>

<p>An interesting implication of this behaviour is the antmill, wherein an ant will lose their trail, and revert to following a nearby ant. If the ant they follow are following <strong>them</strong> to begin with, this can lead to a spiral of ants that can reach miles in diameter, consisting of confused ants walking until they die from exhaustion. </p>

"Under what conditions does the body burn fats, proteins and carbohydrates?","11372","","<p>Searching the internet, I have found lots of conflicting information from various fitness sites concerning when the human body burns fats, proteins and carbohydrates.</p>

<p>My basic understanding was that the body will first utilize glucose and glycogen stores, followed by fats and finally proteins once the fat and glycogen stores become depleted.  Also I believe there is some overlap in this process.</p>

<p>However many fitness websites claim that during high intensity physical activity, the body will prefer to burn protein over fat.</p>

<p>Scientifically speaking, when does the body ordinarily burn the following food groups (proteins, fats and carbohydrates) and how does exercise influence this process?</p>

<p>If you are able to provide graphs or data to back up your answer this will be extra helpful because I am bored of all the speculation I see on other sites.</p>
","<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The system that regulates body energy store consumption is hugely complicated, but is mainly a cooperation between hormones released by the pancreas (insulin - lowers blood sugar and glucagon - raises blood sugar) and the liver (as the bodies main glycogen store and factory for various energy related tasks).</p>

<h1>Fed State</h1>

<p>In the <strong>fed state</strong> (high blood glucose e.g. after a meal), the body produces a large amount of insulin.  When the ratio of insulin:glucagon is high (≈0.5):</p>

<ul>
<li>Dietary glucose is absorbed by the <strong>liver</strong> when glucose concentrations are over 8mM.  This glucose is then either 

<ul>
<li>used in respiration by the liver</li>
<li>converted to glycogen to be <em>stored</em> in the liver</li>
<li>converted into fatty acids which are then transported out to the periphery in very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adipose tissue</strong> (fat tissue) takes up glucose in the blood.  This glucose is then:

<ul>
<li>used in respiration by the adipose tissue</li>
<li>converted into fatty acids then tri-acyl-glycerols (TAGs) - fat.  VLDLs from the liver can also be absorbed by adipose cells to be used for this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Skeletal Muscle</strong> again directly absorbs glucose from the blood

<ul>
<li>During contraction glucose is used directly in respiration to fuel the activity </li>
<li>In preparation for future contraction it is converted into glycogen and <em>stored</em> in the cell</li>
<li>Amino acids are incorporated into cellular proteins <em>though if they are superfluous then they can be used in respiration</em> </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The brain</strong> directly absorbs glucose and uses it in respiration</li>
</ul>

<h1>Early Fasting State</h1>

<p>Where the insulin:glucagon ratio has dropped to around 0.15</p>

<ul>
<li>In the <strong>liver</strong> 

<ul>
<li><em>Glycogenolysis</em> is activated to release glucose from stored glycogen to compensate for falling plasma glucose levels (signalled by elevated glucagon)</li>
<li>Triglycerides in the liver are preferentially broken down for hepatic respiration - fatty acids are transported <em>in</em> from the blood to meet the livers own energy demands</li>
<li>The liver begins the process of <em>gluconeogenesis</em> - making glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adipose tissue</strong>

<ul>
<li>Rapidly starts lipolysis - stored fats are broken down into free fatty acids and glycerol.</li>
<li>Some of the free fatty acids are used for the adipose tissues own respiratory demands</li>
<li>The majority is released to the periphery to be utilised by other tissues</li>
<li>The glycerol released can't be used by most tissues, but is taken up by the liver where it can be used to make glucose by gluconeogenesis </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Skeletal Muscle</strong> 

<ul>
<li>Uptake of glucose from the periphery is <em>reduced</em> to preserve glucose for cells that can't easily use other fuels - e.g. the brain or red blood cells</li>
<li>Free fatty acids become the main fuel for skeletal muscles to conserve the glucose for elsewhere</li>
<li>Unlike in the liver, glycogenolysis is <em>not</em> activated as there are no glucagon receptors in muscle tissue.  This means glucose is only produced from glycogen when muscles are actively contracting, as before.</li>
<li>At this point proteins can start to be broken down,  their skeletons used as an immediate source of energy and amino acids released to be taken up by the liver and used in gluconeogenesis </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The brain</strong> directly absorbs glucose and uses it in respiration.  Fatty acids can not be used as these do not cross the blood brain barrier</li>
</ul>

<h1>Late Fasting State</h1>

<p>If there has still been no glucose intake, the insluin:glucagon ratio falls even further, to around 0.05.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Liver</strong>

<ul>
<li>No further glucose has entered the liver and within 24h all hepatic glycogen stores have been depleted</li>
<li>Gluconeogenesis becomes the principle source of all plasma glucose - the liver creates new glucose from:

<ul>
<li>Amino acids - muscle &amp; liver protein breakdown</li>
<li>Glycerol - from adipose tissue</li>
<li>Lactate - from red blood cells and muscles</li>
</ul></li>
<li>High amounts of fatty acids are converted into Acetyl CoA to be used in respiration by the liver, but too much Acetyl-CoA is produced.  The remainder is converted into ketone bodies that are useless to the liver, so jettisoned to be used by other tissues (esp. the brain)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adipose tissue</strong>

<ul>
<li>As the fast continues into a few days, adipose tissue adapts to producing large amounts of free fatty acids.  <em>This becomes sufficient for most body tissues</em></li>
<li>These fatty acids are used preferentially by all tissues that can use them, conserving glucose for the brain</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Skeletal Muscle</strong> 

<ul>
<li>Fuelled almost entirely by fatty acids and ketone bodies from the liver and adipose tissue</li>
<li>Protein breakdown continues to release carbon skeletons and amino acids for gluconeogenesis - but this is <em>inhibited</em> in the presence of high levels of ketone bodies to prevent unnecessary muscle wastage (still allowing the human to hunt)</li>
<li>Amino acids are incorporated into cellular proteins <em>though if they are superfluous then they can be used in respiration</em> </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The brain</strong>

<ul>
<li>Once ketone levels reach a critical level, they can cross the blood brain barrier to be used as a supplementary energy source</li>
<li>However, it is not sufficient alone, so a net source of glucose is needed from somewhere in the body</li>
</ul></li>

<h1>Progressing to starvation</h1>

<p>This process can continue for a number of weeks, with the body eventually exhausting fatty acids in adipose tissue and being unable to produce ketone bodies in the liver, losing the inhibition of proteolysis causing a last ditch response of muscle breakdown for energy.  Death is usually from heart failure resulting from cardiac muscle breakdown.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>This chart might be useful in summary, it shows where the glucose levels in the blood are coming from at various stages, the gluconeogenesis line indicating protein and fatty acid breakdown:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I47Zy.png"" alt=""Glucose sources in fed fasting starved states""></p>

<h1>Exercise</h1>

<p>Exercise has to be <strong>very</strong> intense to have any effect on this system in normal situations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Resting Muscle</strong> metabolises stored fatty acids for its own energy.  Glycogen stores are replenished from glucose ready for more vigorous contraction.  </li>
<li><strong>Brisk Walking</strong> fatty acid metabolism again provides almost all the energy</li>
<li><strong>Sprinting</strong> Glycogen stores are used, respiration is almost entirely anaerobic as blood vessels are constricted by the muscle activity and ventilation has not had time to increase.  Lactic acid is produced, which can be used by the liver for gluconeogenesis</li>
<li><strong>Middle distance running</strong>: aerobic metabolism takes over as the body adjusts to the higher oxygen demand.  Lactate is still the major end product</li>
</ul>

<p>One example of where this may be more noticeable is during a marathon.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>0 Mins</strong> - Muscle is resting at the start line, as above.</li>
<li><strong>10 mins</strong> - Muscle and liver glycogen released to power muscle contraction </li>
<li><strong>2 Hours</strong> - A marathon requires roughly 700g of glycogen to complete, however the liver can only store around 500g.  This is largely depleted after roughly 20 miles.  Blood glucose levels fall rapidly and the body switches to fatty acid metabolism.  This only provides around 60% of the power output and pace falls off (<em>known as hitting the wall</em>).  At this point, virtually every reserve power source is being used simultaneously to keep the body going.</li>
<li><strong>Finish</strong> - Muscle and liver glycogen are entirely depleted. If glucose levels haven't been maintained by other means, hypoglycaemia results causing confusion, hallucinations and even coma and death. </li>

"Do T-cells express MHC molecules?","11320","","<p>T-cells recognize the MHC molecules and body's own peptides. When it doesn't, it alarms the immune system. But do T-cells express MHC molecules ? If so, how are they using it? If not, what happens when a virus infects T-cells? (Yes, I am confused about HIV infection mechanism too. <a href=""http://www.mcb.uct.ac.za/cann/335/McMichael/McMichael.html"" rel=""nofollow"">They escape from immune response by altering their genes and disrupting the MHC-peptide bonding</a>. I can see that this can work in macrophages. But what is the situation in T-cells ?)</p>
","<p>There are two types of MHC molecules:</p>

<p><strong>All nucleated cells express MHC class 1 proteins</strong>.  A sample of all proteins produced within the cell are 'sliced' into their constituents which are then presented by MHC-I receptors.  This means that if a virus infects a cell, the foreign proteins the cell is induced to make are expressed on the cell membrane by MHC-I.  This is important as antibodies can not cross cell membranes, therefore this is the method by which a cell signals that it is infected by a virus.  </p>

<p>MHC II are the special molecules that are only expressed in antigen-presenting cells, which I think is what you are referring to.  As neither CD4 or CD8 T-cells present antigens, they do not express MHC-II themselves.  Instead CD4 have receptors for MHCII  (while CD8 have receptors for MHCI), allowing them to interact with antigens presented by other immune cells.  </p>

<p>If a virus infects T-cells, the viral proteins are sampled by the MHC-I pathway and presented via MHC-I on the surface of the infected T-Cell.  The immune response then progresses as for any other virally infected cell, destruction by CD8 T-Killers that destroy the cell by non-phagocytic means.</p>

"What are some of the general characteristics of the DH5 alpha strain?","11261","","<p>I can not find some useful sources unfortunately.</p>

<p>Please tell me about some important characteristics of DH5 alpha.</p>

<p>What makes DH5 alpha suitable for the gene cloning?</p>
","<p>There are two possible sources: One is the article from the Bethesda Research Laboratories (reference 1), which names a few, the other is the book ""DNA cloning: A practical approach"" (see reference 2)., which sits here in my bookshelf.</p>

<p>Taking both together, the DH5 alpha strain is derived from the DH5 strain with the introduction of a few additional features. The naming DH are the initials of Douglas Hanahan which developed the strain. The strain is easy to transform with high efficency.</p>

<p>The new features of DH5 alpha are the recA and the endA1 mutations: </p>

<ul>
<li>The endA1 mutation inactivates an intracellular endonuclease that
degrades plasmid DNA.</li>
<li>The recA mutation eliminates homologous recombination. This reduces the chance for deletions and plasmid multimerization.</li>
</ul>

<p>The DH5 strain also has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>The hsdR17 mutation eliminates the restriction endonuclease of the
EcoKI restriction-modification system, so DNA lacking the EcoKI
methylation will not be degraded. DNA prepared from hsdR strains that
are wt for hsdM will be methylated and can be used to transform wt E.
coli K-12 strains.</li>
<li>Δ(lacZ)M15 is the alpha acceptor allele needed for blue-white
screening with many lacZ based vectors.</li>

"What is the difference of function between palisade and spongy layers of leaf?","11128","","<p>I was just wondering that, what are the differences between the spongy and palisade mesophyll cells?</p>
","<p>Well I'm assuming that you already have a fair idea of the structure of a leaf (of course, why else would you ask this question), so I'll just come straight to the point.</p>

<p>The major difference between the two is that the palisade layer lies just above the spongy layer, and vice versa. That's understood. </p>

<p>So firstly, the palisade layer consists of closely packed cylindrical/rectangular cells, while the spongy layer has loosely packed cells with many air pockets.   </p>

<p>Secondly, these cells mentioned above are cylindrical/rectangular in the case of palisade layer, and cells in the spongy layer are rounder in shape.</p>

<p>Thirdly, cells of the palisade layer contain more chloroplasts than the cells of the spongy mesophyll layer. A probable reason is that since the spongy layer is comparatively much further into the leaf, it doesn't get as much sunlight as the palisade, which is a lot closer to the surface. </p>

<p>Lastly, palisade layer helps in <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, (in fact palisade cells are the site of photosynthesis) while the air pockets in the spongy layer allow <strong>exchange of gases</strong> like CO2 required for photosynthesis. So there's a difference in function.</p>

<p>There are also other differences, since the spongy layer contains other components like  vascular bundles, but I believe these are the major ones.</p>

"what is the difference between ""cistron"" and ""gene""","11079","","<p>I'm asking after reading the cognate wikipedia.en article on ""cistron"". I still am not sure about the difference of the two terms. </p>

<p>To me it seems valid to picture a ""cistron"" as the genome wide set of a specific gene's allels ? </p>

<p>Thus if all copies of a gene bear recessive mutations all generating the same phenotypic trait (not necessarily the same mutation) no complementation is observed in a cis-trans test ?</p>
","<p>A cistron is a gene - here's how the word came about:</p>

<p>It's 1955. The proposed double helical structure of DNA has been published and the race is on to understand the implications of this for genetics. Geneticists have been working with genes for decades, but they don't know what genes are. Sanger has sequenced the two polypeptides of insulin, so the idea of a specific sequence of amino acids is established. The emerging molecular geneticists believe that genes will be explained by a feature of DNA, probably a sequence of nucleotides, but they don't know how. Crick and others are theorising about coding (i.e DNA > protein), but at this stage there is no genetic code, no mRNA or tRNA. </p>

<p>Seymour Benzer, at Purdue, is working on <em>fine structure of a genetic region in bacteriophage</em> and in this year he publishes a key paper with that phrase as the title. Without going into a lot of detail about his experimental set up, he is studying a region of the bacteriophage T4 genome called rII. Wild-type T4 can form plaques on <em>E. coli</em> B or <em>E. coli K12</em>. Mutations in the rII region cause a large plaque phenotype in <em>E. coli</em> B so it is easy to isolate them, but these phage cannot produce plaques on <em>E. coli</em> K12 which sets the scene for a powerful assay for rare recombination events.</p>

<p>Benzer used this system to do very fine mapping of thousands of rII mutations because he was able to use the system to measure recombination frequencies, but what matters in the present context is that he was able to do a kind of complementation test (he called this pseudo-allelism). He was able to assign the rII mutants into two groups according to whether, in a mixed infection, they produced lots of progeny. So if he mixed two phage with different mutations and didn't get many progeny he put these in the same group. On the other hand if he did get a lot of progeny he placed the two in different groups. He called this approach a cis-trans test. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The application of the phenotype test to pairs of rII mutants leads to the division of the region into two functionally separable segments."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is as close as he dared to go to claiming to be studying genes. He refers to 'functional units' but never uses the word 'genes' because at this stage that word belonged to classical genetics in higher organisms. In 1957 he proposed the word <strong>cistron</strong> for the functional unit defined by this type of test, and the word caught on, particularly because of its incorporation into the operon model with the idea of polycistronic mRNA. His other coinings, <strong>muton</strong> and <strong>recon</strong> were not adopted.</p>

<p>The two T4 genes/cistrons in the rII region of the phage genome are now called rIIA and rIIB.</p>

<p>And do organisms that use chemosynthesis also use macro molecules similar to chlorophyll and hemoglobin?</p>
","<p>Besides the unicellular organisms cited by other answers (and the fact that plants actually do respiration), there are <a href=""http://umich.uloop.com/news/view.php/77109/4-incredible-photosynthetic-animals"" rel=""noreferrer"">some animals</a> who are able to get, although indirectly, energy from photosynthesis through symbiosis with photosynthesizing organisms. You can try the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_salamander"" rel=""noreferrer"">spotted salamander <em>Ambystoma maculatum</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The spotted salamander is similar to the sea-slug [another of these animals] in that <strong>in order to be partially photosynthetic, it maintains a symbiotic relationship with algae cells</strong>. While it has long been known that a relationship existed between the salamander and the algae, it was presumed to be a relationship in which both organisms worked separately. However, when researcher Ryan Kerney was studying a batch of spotted salamander embryos, he found a bright green color coming from inside their cells.</p>
  
  <p>The chloroplasts were found near the mitochondria within the salamander’s cells, meaning that the <strong>mitochondria were likely directly consuming the oxygen and carbohydrates that are created through photosynthesis*</strong>. The most amazing part about this relationship is that all vertebrates have strong immune systems that tend to destroy any foreign material found within their cells. Although the reason for this is unknown, this makes the spotted salamander the first vertebrates to be discovered to have the ability to photosynthesize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And according to its <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_salamander"" rel=""noreferrer"">wikipedia page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eggs of A. maculatum can have a symbiotic relationship with a green alga, Oophila amblystomatis. Jelly coating prevents the eggs from drying out, but it inhibits oxygen diffusion (required for embryo development). <strong>The Oophila alga photosynthesizes and produces oxygen</strong> in the jelly. <strong>The developing salamander thus metabolizes the oxygen, producing carbon dioxide (which then the alga consumes)</strong>. Photosynthetic algae are <strong>present within the somatic and possibly the germ cells of the salamander</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that this animal is not able to directly perform photosynthesis, but it's still able to get energy from the sun and, being a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"" rel=""noreferrer"">vertebrate (and not a fish from the family Channichthyidae), it has hemoglobin</a>.</p>

<p>Remember that the most plausible theory for the emergence of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast"" rel=""noreferrer"">chloroplasts</a>, the photosynthesizing organelle, in eukaryotes (aka organisms with cellular nucleus) lifeforms is <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/the-origin-of-mitochondria-and-chloroplasts-14747702"" rel=""noreferrer"">through the addition of an external organism</a> (probably a cyanobacteria) to the cell, since chloroplasts (and mitochondrias) have their own separated DNA:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mitochondria and chloroplasts likely evolved from <strong>engulfed prokaryotes that once lived as independent organisms</strong>. At some point, a eukaryotic cell engulfed an aerobic prokaryote, which then formed an endosymbiotic relationship with the host eukaryote, gradually developing into a mitochondrion. Eukaryotic cells containing mitochondria then engulfed photosynthetic prokaryotes, which evolved to become specialized chloroplast organelles</p>

<p>Circular DNA also circumvents the Hayflick limit (thus allowing it to be ""immortal""), which is the number of times a cell population can divide before it stops, presumably due to the shortening of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"">telomeres</a>, the sequences at the end of the chromosomes.

"Calculating number of amino acids in mRNA","10920","","<p>Assuming there were 20 different amino acids and less than 40 types of different tRNAs found in this alien organism. How many amino acids would be found in the translational product of a 600-nucleotide mRNA?</p>

<hr>

<p>I am very confused over how I should solve this question.</p>

<p>If we assume 1 codon = 1 nucleotide, </p>

<p>20 amino acids require 20 different codons = 20 different nucleotides &lt; 40 different tRNAs.</p>

<p>If we assume 1 codon = 2 nucleotides,</p>

<p>20 amino acids require 20 different codons = 5 x 5 combination of nucleotides? (considering A, T, C, G, U)?</p>

<p>5 x 5 = 25 &lt; 40 different tRNAs.</p>

<p>The correct answer is to consider 1 codon = 2 nucleotides.</p>

<p><strong>My question</strong>,</p>

<p>Since both 1 codon = 1 nucleotide and 1 codon = 2 nucleotides fit the requirement of this question, why is 1 codon = 2 nucleotides the correct answer?</p>
","<p>I think I have this figured out. Had to do some math. With our 4 nucleotide system, the number of possible codons is 4<sup>3</sup> = 64. That is number of nucleotides to the codon length power. The question asks us to determine codon length while giving us the number of amino acids and an upper limit on tRNAs. Using the same formula, <pre> #Nucleotides<sup>(Codon-Length)</sup> = #Codons,</pre> we must find a combination of nucleotide number and codon length that gives between 20 and 40 codons.</p>

<pre><code>                               Codon Length
Nucleotides    1         2        3        4        5
     2         2         4        8        16       32
     3         3         9        27       81       243
     4         4         16       64       256      1024
     5         5         25       125      625      3125
     6         6         36       216      1296     7776
     7         7         49       343      2401     16807
</code></pre>

<p>So using this table we see that a few different combinations of Nucleotide number and codon length will fit in that range. A 2-nucleotide system could work if each codon was 5 bases long. A 3-nucleotide system could work with 3 base long codons. A 4-base system cannot work, it goes from less than 20 to more than 40. A 5-base system can work with 2 base codons. A 6-base system can also work with 2-base codons. 7 or more bases fails because even a 2-base codon will make more than 40 codons.</p>

<p>A codon length of 1 nucleotide would require at least 20 nucleotides, so it would not be a good answer.</p>

<p>5 is probably the correct answer because it works with the shortest codon length, though I don't know how you'd get base pairing with an odd number of bases. Perhaps the 5th base pairs with itself. A 6 base system can also work with the same codon length and wouldn't need a self pairing base. However that table shows several combinations could work, so this question might have been to see how you defend your answer.</p>

"Why are not all species hermaphrodites?","10879","","<p>If a hermaphrodite animal (like slug, snail, etc) finds a partner they can mate immediately.</p>

<p>If another animal with ""normal"" reproduction (lets say a mouse) finds a partner they can only mate if they have the opposite gender.</p>

<p>So it seems logical that the hermaphrodite way of reproduction is more successful than the ""normal"" way.</p>

<p>But it is not, as far as I know all higher developed species are using the standard way of reproduction (male and female).</p>

<p>Why? What are the disadvantages of hermaphroditism?</p>
","<p>Firstly I'll clarify that you are talking about <em>simultaneous</em> hermaphrodites rather than <em>sequential</em> hermaphrodites (1st one sex, then the other e.g. the limpet Patella vulgata).</p>

<p>It is perhaps easiest to address the question by countering it and asking why dioecy (2 sex systems/2 gonochoric types e.g. male and female) is better? As you have pointed out there are obvious advantages to being a hermaphroditic species such as more chance of mating - more likely to provide an advantage at very low population densities where interactions are infrequent.</p>

<p>There are two key disadvantages of hermaphroditism which I will briefly cover but have been discussed in <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519377903630"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper</a> and probably other costs. </p>

<p>The first is energy costs. Maintaining the capacity to produce male and female gametes will be more costly than maintaining one. This gives the hermaphrodite a fitness disadvantage because energy is rarely an infinite resource. Therefore at higher population densities, when mating opportunities are not rare, the gonochoric individuals will have a higher fitness because they have more energy. Monogamy is also analogous to rare encounters but true monogamy is rare (1 partner for life).</p>

<p>The second disadvantage of hermaphroditism is self fertilisation. This will cause an increase in homozygosity and lead to inbreeding depression (reduced fitness).</p>

<p>So you are right to some extent...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the hermaphrodite way of reproduction is more successful than the
  ""normal"" way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...but the conditions which give rise to an hermaphroditic advantage are restricting. Overall, the above costs, combined with the obvious complexity of evolving the ability to produce male and female gametes, the ability to both fertilise and be fertilised, pregnancy and birth, and mating systems, mean that it is often more beneficial to be a dioecious species. Thus dioecy evolves.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT: Question Raised by @Single_Digit</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have been pondering this question for a while and I get what RG255
  is saying. I'm just not sure I entirely buy it. Take earthworms, for
  example. They are simultaneous true hermaphrodites (as far as I
  understand). The anatomy doesn't have to be that complex*. They simply
  have two genital openings (one for eggs and one for sperm) and they
  line up in a ""69"" (excuse the vulgarity) position. This should, in
  theory, minimize the inbreeding depression. However, it doesn't
  eliminate the maintenance of two sets of reproductive systems. But
  most organisms are not internally fertilized mammals with wildly
  complicated systems of internalized embryonic care. Most species lay a
  pile of eggs that a male squirts sperm on or squirt eggs while the
  male squirt sperm and then they hope for the best.</p>
  
  <p>I would think the advantages of simultaneous parenting (after all,
  many MANY species' males don't provide much in the way of child care)
  and its fitness advantage would vastly outweigh the burden of a second
  set of reproductive organs.</p>
  
  <p>With that said, I don't have a better explanation, but I find the
  question a very interesting one. The linked article is pay-walled,
  aside from the abstract, but I still disagree with some of its tenets.
  To me true hermaphroditism should be very common (I realize it isn't)
  in species that don't need two parents to raise offspring, but do
  benefit from some (as in one parent's) parental care. I recognize that
  it would do little to help species that merely dump gametes and leave
  because specialization of one reproductive system would likely do the
  job better and both genders equally contribute under that type of
  system.</p>
  
  <p>So, RG255 convince me! Clearly there are good reasons, since gender
  (or asexual repr) is the norm, but I need more/better evidence.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><ul>
  <li>Yes I realize they would need separate internal anatomies for each type of gamete, but still...</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>My response:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have presented one example of hermaphroditism and used that as
  evidence that all species should be hermaphrodites. Earthworms are
  small slow creatures living in soil, I don't imagine they have high
  rates of encounter, and therefore low rates of encountering the
  opposite sex, therefore hermaphroditism would be favoured as discussed
  above. </p>
  
  <p>Further, you say most species are external fertilisers (do you
  have a reference for this?) and therefore it is not costly be a
  hermaphrodite. I don't see your logic there, the cost is not
  necessarily to do with the cost of bearing child, producing &amp;
  maintaining the gonads and gametes is also a costly process. I would
  argue that this is extremely complex. This is not just on a
  morphological level but also physiological: in non-hermaphroditic
  species the sexes have very different, and often, conflicting gene
  expression and hormone production patterns. Hermaphrodites would not
  be able to optimize to the fulfilling both the male and female roles.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, you pointed out that the worms do not inbreed. Inbreeding

<p><strong>Further response from @single_digit:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well fair enough about my external fertilizers comment. I don't have a
  reference, but I was thinking all multicellular life and I'd have to
  imagine that when you factor in plants, that external fertilization is
  relatively the norm (as is hermaphrodism (dioecy) for the plants). As
  to earthworms, I disagree about your description of them. Their
  densities are actually pretty high, so I'd wager they encounter each
  other frequently, so I'm not sure where that leaves them in terms of
  pressures for hermaphroditism. Your point on the physiologic/hormonal
  issues of maintaining the systems is one I haven't previously
  considered. I honestly don't have any clue as to how daunting (or
  simple) that is, but I'd imagine that the sophistication of the
  systems would play a pretty key role. Makes me wonder how much this
  has been researched in true hermaprhodites. I suppose the main thing I
  keep coming back to is the overwhelming disadvantage gender has in
  terms of potential to create offspring. Males in many (most?) species
  essentially act as little more than sperm donors, thus half the
  individuals have effectively zero fitness. That just seems like an
  overwhelming advantage for hermaphrodites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>My Response</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do you consider half of the individuals to have zero fitness?
  Fitness is widely accepted as the number of offspring a parent
  produces because this is directly related to number of copies of their
  genes passed to the next generation. Sperm donor type males achieve
  increased fitness by mating as do females - with out the male they
  would never be fertilized. The key disadvantage of dioecy is the
  halved (assuming equal sex ratio) frequency of potential encounters
  that could lead to mating. The general disadvantages of
  hermaphroditism are inbreeding depression and high cost &amp; complexity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Single_digit:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zero fitness isn't exactly correct, but if we look at parental care as
  conveying a survival advantage for K selected species, and huge
  numbers of offspring conveying an advantage for r-selected species
  (obviously the type of env affects this) does a deadbeat dad really
  optimize for either of these? Passing on genes is fine, but if
  offspring survival is low, does it matter? Does it simply boil down to
  the maintenance of two repr systems plus decreased fitness from
  inbreeding vs the increased reproductive success from extra child
  care? Or is there more?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>My response:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>r/K selection theory has generally been disregarded in the
  evolutionary biology community due to the substantial evidence against
  it so it is unhelpful to think of selection in this way. As long as
  the 2 sexes strategy is more successful at passing on genes than a
  hermaphroditic strategy it will (should) prevail. Dioecy will be more
  successful if the hermaphroditism introduces to much cost through
  production and maintenance of sexual organs/gamete and inbreeding
  whilst not attaining substantial gains from higher potential mating
  frequency.</p>

<p><strong>@Single_Digit</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interesting about r/K selection. I hadn't heard that. Do you have any
  links? I'd be curious to learn more there. I incorrectly earlier made
  a comment about dioecy where I meant monecy. But this seems to beg the
  question, why is monecy/hermaphroditism so much more prevalent in
  plants? Obviously there are different survival pressures, but I'd
  think the same basic principles would apply as in animals, but the
  condition seems to be far more common than in animals.</p>

"What is the H+ gradient in mitochondria?","10858","","<p>I would like to understand what the term H+ Gradient means. I googled this question and found terms such as chemiosmosis and ion gradient being tossed around. I am very new to biology and I do not know any advanced terms or anything of the like. What I do understand is that the mitochondria produces ATP and has something called a proton pump.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
","<p>Lets start with a general definition: A gradient is the difference in the concentration of a substance (this can be a solutant in liquids, a gas or whatever) between two places. The image below shows the general definition. If nothing else happens what keeps the gradient stable, over time diffusion will cause an equilibrium between both places. The flow of substance always goes from the high concentration to the low (indicated by the arrows).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SltDs.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In biological systems the two parts of the gradient are usually divided by a membrane and are more stable. Gradients can be generated by active transport which requires the input of energy to work against the gradient. Examples would be the concentration gradient along a membrane like protons (positively charged hydrogen-ions), as this can be seen in the mitochondria. Here three complexes of the respiratory chain (I, III and IV) pump protons from the matrix in the intermembrane space, which requires energy. The fourth complex (V) pumps the protons back and uses the released energy from this process to make ATP. See the figure below which shows this process schematically (from <a href=""http://oregonstate.edu/instruction/bi314/summer09/mito.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>):</p>

"Why does an electrical shock freeze up muscles?","10822","","<p>Why is it when someone comes into contact with an electrical supply that their body freezes up and is unable to move away from the electrical source?</p>

<p>Can someone explain this through a physiological perspective?</p>
","<p>Interesting question!</p>

<p>An important factor here is the <strong>let-go phenomenon</strong>, which is defined as the current level in the arm that will cause the hand to involuntarily grip the current source. When the fingers are wrapped around a large cable, most adults will be able to let go with a current of less than 6 mA. At 22 mA, however, more than 99% of adults will not be able to let go. </p>

<p>Nearly all cases of inability to let go involve alternating current. Alternating current repetitively stimulates nerves and muscles, resulting in a <strong>tetanic (sustained) contraction</strong> that lasts as long as the contact is continued. If this leads to the subject tightening his or her grip on a conductor, the result is continued electric current flow through the person and lowered contact resistance.</p>

<p>Given that the <strong>current flow</strong> in the forearm <strong>stimulates both the muscles of flexion and extension</strong>, it seems surprising that one cannot let go. However, the <strong>muscles of flexion are stronger</strong>, making the person unable to voluntarily let go (similar to the fact that a crocodile's jaws can be kept shut with your bare hands, but one should better not attempt to keep them open like that...). </p>

<p>Direct currents below 300 mA have no let-go phenomenon, because the hand is not involuntarily clamped.</p>

<p>Several different outcomes may occur when a person grasps a conductor giving <strong>10 kV AC</strong> hand-to-hand voltage. Within 10 to 100 milliseconds, muscles in the current path will strongly contract. The person may grasp the conductor more tightly. However, mostly subjects are propelled away from the contact, likely due to generalized muscle contractions. </p>

"Why are there both stop and start codons?","10792","","<p>Based on my understanding from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code#RNA_codon_table"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia</a>, there is the (RNA) start codon AUG and the stop codons UAA, UGA, UAG.  AUG can also encode Methionine, I'm assuming if it appears in the middle of a mRNA sequence.  </p>

<p>But is there a chemical reason there are both start and stop codons?  Eg, if I only had a stop codon, would that also imply the next codon was start? Are there cases where there is a stop codon and the next codon isn't start?</p>
","<p>Start and stop codons are instructions for the ribosome to start and stop protein synthesis, respectively.</p>

<p>The region between the start and stop codon (inclusive of them) is called ORF (open reading frame) or sometimes CDS (Coding sequence). </p>

<p><strong>Why does ribosome need explicit instructions for start and stop?</strong></p>

<p>Ribosome recognizes an RNA as a mRNA if it has certain features. In bacteria and other prokaryotes there is a region on the mRNA called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_binding_site"" rel=""nofollow"">Ribosome Binding Site</a> (RBS) that helps in initial recruitment of the ribosome. In eukaryotes there are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozak_consensus_sequence"" rel=""nofollow"">Kozak consensus</a> sequences that help in identification of a start site. When the ribosome encounters an <code>AUG</code> codon then the initiation reactions take place (there are some proteins called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">initiation factors</a> that help in this process). The ribosome just keeps moving along the mRNA and producing a polypeptide unless it encounters a stop codon. When it does other proteins called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">release factors</a> come into play and they dislodge the ribosome from the mRNA. </p>

<p><strong>What about a second <code>AUG</code> codon?</strong></p>

<p>If the ribosome encounters another <code>AUG</code> codon after the start then it would consider it as a codon for methionine. However there are situations when the second <code>AUG</code> can act as an alternative start site. You can see this <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3025576/"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a> for details. </p>

<p><strong>Why is stop codon essential?</strong></p>

<p>You can imagine a situation where ribosome just goes till the end of mRNA — why stop it? The reason for this is that the mRNA 3' terminus usually has regulatory regions and most importantly poly-A tails (in eukaryotes) that should not be translated. Moreover stop codon also signals the ribosome to dislodge from the mRNA. If such processes didn't exist then ribosome will remain attached to the RNA.</p>

<p><strong>If I only had a stop codon, would that also imply the next codon was start?</strong></p>

<p>No. Because stop codon works only when translation has already started. However it is not essential that the stop codon should be followed by the 3'UTR. Usually in bacteria a single mRNA codes for multiple proteins. There are many ORFs that are lined one after the other; such mRNAs are called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA#Monocistronic_versus_polycistronic_mRNA"" rel=""nofollow"">polycistronic mRNAs</a>. In these cases there is another start codon a few distance ahead of a previous stop codon. </p>

"Starch vs Cellulose. What are the differences between Alpha and Beta glucose ring structure in them?","10705","","<p>I'm studying ""Campbell Biology, 10th Edition"" and in chapter 5 page 71 there's a statement I can't understand. according to book:</p>

<p>My question is if all glucose monomers of cellulose are all in the β
configuration (according to figures) why each monomer in cellulose is “upside down” with respect to its neighbors and is not just all the same as in glucose monomers.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QeSst.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QeSst.png"" alt=""Starch and cellulose structures""></a></p>
","<p>The reason the monomer units are shown as alternating orientation in the cellulose case and not for starch is due to the angles required for the bonds between the atoms involved.  </p>

<p>Note that in α-glucose the OH groups of the #1 and #4 carbons are shown on the same side of the ring.  When these two groups are changed into a single O joining two α monomers into starch, they have to remain in the same position.  When a single O joins them together, that oxygen requires the angle between the bond be less than 180 degrees, so the two glucoses have to be on one side of the oxygen.  That's fine in the drawing because in α glucose both OH groups are pointing down.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in β-glucose the OH groups of carbons 1 and 4 are on opposite sides of the glucose ring. Joining two β monomers to make cellulose requires that these two OH groups point in the same direction so that when changed into bonds to the single O, the angle which the oxygen requires can be provided.  To get the two OH groups pointing the same way requires one of the two β-glucoses to flip relative to the other.  Hence you get the monomers of cellulose alternating in orientation.</p>

<p>Polycythemia is the state when you have an elevated number of red blood cells, characterized by an increased Hematokrit level.

"How come large herbivores have such thin legs?","10683","","<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
This question is very similar to <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23901/comparative-leg-sizes"">this</a> and related to <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/51243/what-is-the-anatomical-term-for-a-two-jointed-leg"">this one</a> (though the latter focuses on homology instead of scaling laws). However, <em>the answer to this question is far more comprehensive</em>, in particular it offers a plausible explanation <em>why</em> horse legs evolved as they did (vs human or even rhino legs).</p>

<p>Large grazing mammals such as horses, moose, and cows tend to have relatively thin legs despite being up to ~1000kg. For example, this rider's and her horse's legs appear to have about the same cross-sectional area both for below and above the ""knee"":
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2h5FB.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2h5FB.jpg"" alt=""tight fitting pants""></a></p>

<p>If this horse is 500 kg (a mid-range mass for horses), each leg would have to support 125 kg, compared to only 37.5 kg for a 75 kg adult. Why don't we see a corresponding difference in cross-section?</p>
","<p>Elephant, rhinoceros, &amp;c all have much thicker legs in proportion.  The answer, I think, lies in the fact that the animals you mention all evolved as cursorial animals (that is, they run to escape predators).  Less mass in the lower leg means it swings easier, so the animal can run faster. </p>

<p>There are two things you're apparently not noticing in that picture.  First, the the horse's lower leg is almost entirely bone (and some tendon), and it's bone that does the supporting.  The propulsive power comes from the large muscles of the hip, thighs, and shoulders.  </p>

<p>Second, the lower part of the leg (with the white wrappings) is not anatomically equivalent to the human's lower leg, but to the bones of the hand and foot.  You can see this if you look closely at the rear leg in that picture.  The femur, equivalent to the human's thigh, ends at the knee just above the belly line.  Then the tibia extends about halfway down, ending at another joint which you might think is the knee, but which is called the 'hock' in horse-speak.  The white-wrapped part is a metatarsal, equivalent to human foot bones, then there pastern bones equivalent to human toe bones, ending in the hoof/toenail.</p>

<p>So consider that you can, if reasonably fit, walk around on tiptoe without crushing your foot and toe bones, then imagine the end result of your ancestors having done this for the last several tens of millions of years :-)</p>

<p>PS: With horses, there is some effect from human selection, too.  Racing &amp; show breeds tend to have thin lower legs, draft horses &amp; working breeds have proportionately thicker ones.  My first horse, a thorobred/arab mix, had legs about as thick as my wrists (granted, I'm a fairly muscular guy); my current mustang, about the same height &amp; weight, has legs about twice as thick.</p>

<p>If not, then the anisotropy of the remaining part of <strong>A-Band</strong> must be a consequence of the relative arrangement of Actin and Myosin which are independently isotropic, and hence cannot give a possible isotropic arrangement.   </p>

<p>If yes, then that indicates that the myosin filaments are anisotropic in themselves and actin filaments are isotropic.

<p><a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/82124/anisotropic-refractive-index-with-isotropic-components"">Here</a> is a directly related question I asked on physics.se. It partly solves the problem of possible arrangement of isotropic elements to generate anisotropy.</p>
","<p>This is sort of technical answer, but I hope its helpful I hope. </p>

<p>All these bands in the sarcomere are anisotropic.  Isotropy would imply that the structure/properties of something is equally ordered or coherent in all 3 directions.  The sarcomere has definite structure along its longer axis so the H band is anisotropic.  </p>

<p>Since the H band is a small structure compared to the actin and myosin components of the sarcomere, much of the signal that one measures via diffraction or polarization experiments is from those two fibers and less information would be discernible from the anchoring portion (H band) of the myosin filament.  </p>

<p>In the case of the A and H bands, which are identified by electron microscopy, the structure along the sarcomere axis is not very strong - they are thin sections of the sarcomere and tend to function structurally to connect the actin and myosin axes.  </p>

<p>Because of this the information that you might get from A and H band segment studies will be that 'these bands are not very ordered along the axis of the sarcomere'.  That's not a lot of information, and we know this from other experiments.  But it is information nonetheless because they have some spatial organization. </p>

Genes can also be silenced by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone#Structure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">histone modification</a>, binding a gene to histones reduces its activity, ie it produces less product.</p>

So now I wonder: how old are shells, typically, that you see on beaches? Do they wear out after a year of sand abrasion? 100 years, a million? Is it known? </p>
","<p>Mollusk shells found on typical east coast (US) beaches can range from days old (the animal that made the shell died recently) to thousands of years old.  Some shells in our state, North Carolina, have been dated as 40,000 years old.  A high number of ""seashells"" found on east coast beaches are from mollusks that lived in the marsh on the back side of the island.   The presence of these shells on ocean beaches provides evidence of island migration - the island has moved landward over the marsh until what was once the marsh is now the ocean shore.  Once buried in the sand, the shell is well preserved until erosion uncovers it.  Occasionally, fossilized shells are washed up on beaches after having been dislodged from offshore limestone deposits - these shells can be millions of years old.</p>

"How does a plant grow before photosynthesis is possible?","10539","","<p>During photosynthesis, a plant translates CO<sub>2</sub>, water and light into O<sub>2</sub>. I assume the carbon C is further used for the growing process. I wonder how the plant grows <em>before</em> the time where photosynthesis is possible, i.e. before there are even leaves, in which photosynthesis occurs. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To what extent does the plant grow from the seed/the minerals in the ground? </p>
  
  <p>How much carbon are relevant for which parts of the plant and at what times of the evolution of the plant? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know if there are only these life periods of the plant, i.e. if there are other major biochemist-of-growing changes, than in the comparison before and after the plant got leaves. So are there other relevant aspects to this? If there <em>are</em> leaves present, is the rigid structure of the plant only coming from the CO<sub>2</sub> in the air and not from the ground anymore? </p>

<p>The answer will probably depend on the plant. So here is another formulation of the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are typical characteristics of different plants in this regard? I.e., how do common species of plants manage their C consumption before (and after) the development of leaves?</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>There are quite a few questions and thoughts in there, I'll try to cover them all:</p>

<p>First, to correct your initial word equation: <strong>During photosynthesis, a plant translates CO<sub>2</sub> and water into O<sub>2</sub> and carbon compounds using energy from light (photons)</strong>.</p>

<p>You are correct to assume the C is further used for the growing process; it is used to make sugars which store energy in their bonds. That energy is then released when required to power other reactions, which is how a plant lives and grows. C is also incorporated into all the organic molecules in the plant.</p>

<p>Plants require several things to live: CO2, light, water and minerals. If any of those things is missing for a sustained period, growth will suffer. Most molecules in a plant require some carbon, which comes originally from CO<sub>2</sub>, and also an assortment of other elements which come from the mineral nutrients in the soil. So the plant is completely reliant on minerals.</p>

<p>Most plants, before a leaf is established or roots develop, grow using energy and nutrients stored in the endosperm and cotyledons of the seed. I whipped up a rough diagram below. Cotyledons are primitive leaves inside the seed. The endosperm is a starchy tissue used only for storage of nutrients and energy. The radicle is the juvenile root. The embryo is the baby plant.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F80Hu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>When the seed germinates the embryo elongates, the endosperm depletes, the testa ruptures, and the cotyledons emerge from the seed. The cotyledons are green, and like leaves can photosynthesise, so as soon as they are in the light the plant is able to make carbon compounds. The radicle elongates at the same time, and becomes the root, so the plant is very quickly able to obtain fresh nutrients from the soil (or whatever it's growing in).</p>

<p>At all stages of a plant's life it is using both energy stored in carbon compounds (from CO<sub>2</sub>) and nutrients which it took up via its roots. At no point does the plant start to depend solely on the CO<sub>2</sub> in the air for its growth.</p>

<p>You are right that the way in which plants acquire energy and nutrients prior to leaves and roots being established varies between plants. Above I outlined the way <em>most</em> plants use. But there are lots of variations. For example, orchids have very tiny seeds, some barely visible to the naked eye, like specks of dust. They have no endosperm or storage tissue, so they have to rely on a symbiotic <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mycorrhizal fungus</a> to get carbon and nutrients. The fungus grows through the coat of the orchid seed, then provides everything the growing plant needs until it has its own leaves. Then the orchid repays the fungus by providing sugars.</p>

<p>There are lots of other examples, but we could go on all day! </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mycoplasma genitalium:  it has only about 480 genes in its genome of 580 070 nucleotide pairs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But 480 genes * 3 ~ 1500 nucleotide pairs.</p>

<p>Where I have made mistake ?</p>
","<p>You seem to have some confusion, so let's clear things up.</p>

<p>A gene is a stretch of DNA (or RNA) that codes for a polypeptide (protein), that is a series of aminoacids bound together.
Each gene consists of nucleotides bound together, which are interpreted by the cellular machinery in groups of three, called <em>triplets</em>.
DNA is first transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into proteins.
Each triplet codes for one <strong>aminoacid</strong> not one gene! In fact genes are not ""coded"" by anything, they are the code!</p>

<p>Now, what I just wrote is extremely simplified, there are other important details that I omitted, but hopefully it cleared your doubt.</p>

<p>To give you some further detail: not every single nucleotide in a gene will code for an aminoacid. There are regulatory elements such as the promoter of the gene, which allows the enzymes that transcribe the DNA to attach to the gene (essentialy it says: ""hey, start transcription right here!""). Similarly, enhancers and silencers can tune up or down transcription of the gene.</p>

<p>In eukaryotes there are big stretches of DNA called <em>introns</em> that are not coding for anything but have big importance for regulating transcription. In fact a single mRNA can be used to code more than one protein, using a process called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing"">alternative splicing</a>.</p>

<p>There are also regions of DNA that code for RNA sequences not translated into proteins at all, but which have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"">all sorts of regulatory functions in the cell</a>.</p>

"Why is glucose our primary source of energy?","10448","","<p>Is there any evolutionary reason for glucose being the ""main"" molecule used as a source of energy, beginning with glycolysis and subsequently cellular respiration (after being converted to two pyruvate molecules)? Or did this particular biochemical pathway arise ""by fluke"" early on in the history of life?</p>

<p>A colleague of mine told me that it was because as shown below, all of beta-D-glucose's hydroxyl substituents are all equatorially positioned (when in the correct chair conformation), which lends to its general stability.</p>

<p>Could this have played a factor in the beginnings of energy metabolism, and if so, why? </p>
","<p>I thought this was a great question.  In particular because it hints at two questions.  The first is 'why carbohydrates are used to store energy' in general. The second being 'why glucose rather than other carbohydrates?' in particular. </p>

<p>Glucose metabolism (and glycogen storage) is a core gene pathway - its found in <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v220/n5167/abs/220606a0.html"">bacteria</a> archaea and eukaryotes.  So probably the most that we can readily say about question one is that as @rwst points out this pathway has proven to be useful at a critical juncture of the formulation of living things on earth.  If you look at <a href=""http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ko00010"">glucose metabolism pathways</a>, you can see that glycerate compounds and pyruvate are the actual intermediates that are used to create energy.  The first thing about these molecule worth noting is that they have a good mix of carbon and oxygen, which would make it easier to extract energy - creating CO2 from these compounds may even predates the existence of atmospheric oxygen.  So glucose and fructose (which is actually derived from glucose in the metabolic pathway) are actually storage molecules themselves, easily broken down to smaller molecules. </p>

<p>As to the second question: there are quite a few ways to arrange oxygen around the carbohydrate ring.  why glucose?  The advantages of glucose is probably a subtle one.  The structural properties of glycogen might be a reason that the use of glucose monomer is so important for glycogen. There is no evidence that I can find for this, so its always possible that glucose was just the first hexose carbohydrate to be biologically used.  Its sort of hard to imagine that the structure of glucose does not play some sort of role in cell structure though. </p>

In other words, how does the tRNA know whether the codon is in 5' to 3' direction? I also heard that anything that is translated from 3' to 5' direction is degraded. Is it true? </p>
","<p>The tRNA is not acting alone, it has the help of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ribosome</a>. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vArV7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The Ribosome assembles at the beginning of the transcript and starts the translation at the first AUG codon. It then binds the first tRNA which fits to the mRNA. The tRNA is then moved from the A-position to the P-position and the next tRNA is binding (the move around and bind by chance. A nice animation is found in the Wikipedia article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_%28biology%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">translation</a> (which is also the source for the image above). </p>

<p>Translation can't go into the other direction, it is always in 5' -> 3'.</p>

<p>To recognize the right direction (and the right starting point) the Ribisome is not simply starting at the 5`end of the mRNA. Before the start codon AUG the mRNA contains a regulatory, untranslated region, the so-called 5'UTR. The end of the 5'UTR of eukaryotes contains the so called methylguanosine cap (and is only present in mature mRNA), in proaryotes this is done by the Shine-Delgano sequence. Both are recognized by the ribosome. After binding to the mRNA, the ribosome slides along the nucleotide chain until it reaches the first AUG to initiate translation.

"Is it possible for a person to become ""reinfected"" with the same strain of a virus?","10289","","<p>If a person contracts a virus, viral conjunctivitis for example, is it possible for the individual to become ""reinfected"" with the exact same strain of the virus once the person has it treated and the symptoms have gone away? I am a nursing student and am fascinated with virology, but my basic microbiology class did not go very in-depth on the subject. </p>
","<p>The nature of infectious agents is that they transmit between organisms. This means that they have reservoirs outside a single host, and hence of course reinfection with the exact strain is possible if this strain leaves the body and at a later stage is carried back to it. This could typically happen for example with the common influenza, spreading from one child to other children at school and later being carried back to the original child through them.</p>

<p>This is what the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"" rel=""nofollow"">adaptive immune response</a> counters: Immune cells specific to a pathogen will proliferate and differentiate both into effector cells to destroy the pathogen, and into memory cells. These can mount a much stronger immune response much faster when they come in contact with the same (or a structurally very similar) pathogen, meaning that a secondary infection normally results in weaker or no symptoms, or at least a quicker regress of the infection.</p>

<p>Reinfection immunity is complicated by evasion mechanisms pathogens have evolved. In viruses the most prominent one is probably high mutation rates of those antigens which tend to be targeted by immune systems. This means that reinfection with the same strain of virus can still trigger an immune response like a completely unknown pathogen. Again, influenza is a great example. The reason why we get flu again winter after winter and why the influenza vaccine is not commonly distributed*, is because this virus tends to mutate over the year with relatively low infection prevalence. Then during the winter, when human immune systems are generally weakened already by the temperature, typically only one or two strains cause epidemics - because we were maybe immune to last year's influenza, but this year's has mutated antigens which our immune system does not recognise yet.</p>

<p>*) Influenza vaccine exists. It is developed new every year and is distributed among the population at risk: in the UK for example, people older than 65[if I recall that poster correctly] are encouraged to have the vaccination annually. It is not given to younger people as the vaccination itself causes symptoms, i.e. ""flu"". Younger people would easily resist the actual influenza and hence it is a better bet simply to hope they do not get infected at all. Older people however face a realistic risk of death from the virus and hence the vaccination can save lives.</p>

"Why should I degas my gel solution for polyacrylamide gels?","10268","","<p>In protocols for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) I often see instructions to degas the gel solution by putting it under vacuum for 10-15 minutes before polymerizing the gel. </p>

<p>I usually don't do this, and when I tried it once I couldn't see any difference. So I'm wondering what exactly the degassing is meant to achieve and how big the effect should be.</p>

<ul>
<li>What effect is degassing the gel solution supposed to have?</li>
<li>How important is degassing to achieve good gels?</li>
</ul>

<p>Any literature that examines the effect of degassing would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>The reason for degassing your gels is to remove oxygen. Oxygen in the gel interferes with polymerisation, slowing it down and making it less consistent, so degassing makes it faster and more uniform.</p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://www.encorbio.com/protocols/SDS-PAGE.htm"">EncorBio SDS-PAGE protocol</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Polymerization is quicker and more uniform if you degas the first three solutions for a few minutes in an Ehrlenmeyer flask on a house vacuum prior to addition of the last three reagents. Molecular oxygen inhibits polymerisation by reacting with the free radical SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> ions, which is actually the reason why PAGE gels are poured in tubes or between plates and not in open top horizontal apparatuses, as can be done with agarose. Also it's a good idea to layer some isopropanol on top of the gel as this prevents oxygen getting in and inhibiting polymerisation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oxygen can also lead to oxidation of protein products, which might be crucial if you then want to extract the products and use them for something else (e.g. <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elps.200305800/abstract"">Sun &amp; Anderson, 2004</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, having bubbles in your gel can distort the results and make them less reproducible, as the bubbles will not form consistently with each repetition and they disrupt the physical medium of the polyacrylamide. So another purpose of degassing is to ensure repeatability.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.bio-rad.com/LifeScience/pdf/Bulletin_1156.pdf"">Bio-Rad acrylamide polymerisation info sheet</a> has the best info I could find:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The formation of polyacrylamide gels proceeds via free radical
  polymerization. The reaction is therefore inhibited by any 
  element or compound that serves as a free radical trap
  (Chrambach 1985). Oxygen is such an inhibitor. Oxygen,
  present in the air, dissolved in gel solutions, or adsorbed to
  the surfaces of plastic, rubber, etc., will inhibit, and in extreme
  cases prevent, acrylamide polymerization. Proper degassing
  is critical for reproducibility. Therefore, one of the most 
  important steps in the preparation of polyacrylamide gels is
  the evacuation, or “degassing” of gel solutions immediately
  prior to pouring the gel. This is done by placing the flask of
  gel solution in a vacuum chamber or under a strong aspirator.
  In some cases, a vacuum pump may be required.</p>
  
  <p>Buffer stock solutions and monomer stock solutions are usually
  stored at 4°C. Cold solutions have a greater capacity for 
  dissolved oxygen. The process of degassing is faster and
  more complete if the gel solution is brought to room 
  temperature (23–25°C)‚ before degassing begins.
  Furthermore, if a cold gel solution is placed under vacuum,
  the process of evacuation tends to keep the solution cold.
  Pouring a gel with a cold solution will have a substantial 
  negative effect on the rate of polymerization and on the 
  quality of the resulting gel.</p>
  
  <p>Polymerization in which riboflavin is used as one of the 
  initiators calls for degassing. The conversion of riboflavin from
  the flavo to the leuco form (the species active in initiation)
  actually requires a small amount of oxygen (Gordon 1973).</p>
  
  <p>This explains why polymerization initiated primarily by riboflavin
  can be completely blocked by exhaustive degassing. However,
  oxygen in excess of that needed to convert riboflavin to the
  active form will inhibit polymer chain elongation, as it does in
  reactions initiated only by ammonium persulfate and TEMED.
  Thus, while degassing is still important for limiting inhibition, 
  it must not be so extensive that it prevents conversion of
  riboflavin to the active form. For polymerization initiated by
  riboflavin/TEMED, or riboflavin/TEMED/ammonium persulfate
  systems, degassing should not exceed 5 min.</p>
  
  <p>A consequence of the interaction of riboflavin with oxygen is
  that riboflavin seems to act as an oxygen scavenger. This is
  supported by the observation that the addition of riboflavin 
  (5 µg/ml) to stacking gel solutions containing ammonium 
  persulfate/TEMED initiators results in cleaner, more uniform
  polymerization at gel surfaces exposed to oxygen (such as
  combs). The same effect could likely be achieved by more
  thorough degassing of solutions without riboflavin.</p>
  
  <p>Whether using chemical polymerization (ammonium 
  persulfate/TEMED) or photochemical polymerization
  (riboflavin/TEMED or riboflavin/TEMED/ammonium persulfate
  initiators), reproducible gel quality and separation 
  characteristics require careful attention to gel solution 
  temperature before degassing, and to degassing time, 
  temperature, and vacuum. These parameters should be 
  kept constant every time gels are prepared.</p>

<p>According to the Medline, <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000167.htm"">Hypovolemic shock</a> occurs when a human loses about 1/5 (or more) of his blood volume. 1/5th of 5L is one litre. Since each mosquito sucks 5µL, this would take about 200.000 mosquitoes. To suck out all blood would take 1 million mosquitoes. (This is not possible since mosquitoes depend on an existing blood pressure, as reference 3 shows. If a capillary is empty due to massive blood sucking, they change to another.)</p>

<p>Besides this theoretical (but interesting) calculation, there are some real problems about getting biten by so many mosquitos. First, this is a question of available skin. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin#Skin_components"">human skin</a> is about 2 square meters in size, which would require 100.000 bites per square meter. To break this down further, a square meter has 10.000 square centimeters, so there would be 10 mosquitos which need to bite you per square centimeter. Rather unlikely.</p>

<p>Then each mosquito injects a mix of anti-coagulants, pain killers etc. prior to sucking to keep the blood from clotting and also to make sure you won't notice the bite immediately. As pointed out in the comments, this would already cause a lot of trouble and probably cause massive bleeding, since the effect of the anti-coagulants would sum up when biten by thousands of mosquitos. Additionally the body reacts by releasing histamines and since the amount would also be massive, this would cause real trouble and probably kill you.</p>

"How do inward rectifier potassium channels work in the heart?","10021","","<p>Apparently in cardiomyocytes, there is an inward rectifying potassium channel that operates during phase 4 of the cardiomyocyte action potential.

"What is the mIU unit as used in hCG hormone levels?","10008","","<p>My girlfriend is in her very early pregnancy, and has provided several blood samples by now where the doctors measure her hCG levels.</p>

<p>The hCG hormone level is measure in a unit called <code>mIU/ml</code> which I figure is milli-something per milliliter blood. But what is that something? What is the <code>IU</code>?</p>
","<p>IU stands for ""International Units"" and it is an arbitrarily chosen unit of measure used mostly to quantify hormones, vitamins or various substances found in the blood.</p>

<p>The idea is well explained by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia article on international units</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many biological agents exist in different forms or preparations (e.g. vitamin A in the form of retinol or beta-carotene). The goal of the IU is to be able to compare these, so that different forms or preparations with the same biological effect will contain the same number of IUs. To do so, the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization provides a reference preparation of the agent, arbitrarily sets the number of IUs contained in that preparation, and specifies a biological procedure to compare other preparations of the same agent to the reference preparation. Since the number of IUs contained in a new substance is arbitrarily set, there is no equivalence between IU measurements of different biological agents. For instance, one IU of vitamin E cannot be equated with one IU of vitamin A in any way, including mass or efficacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For hCG, in the 55th report for of the WHO Expert Commitee on Biological Standardization, you could find:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Expert Committee on Biological Standardization, after consideration of this issue (11), concluded that the choice of unit should be made on a case-by-case basis and reflect, and be based on, the biological and medical as well as the physicochemical information available. 
  Many biologicals exist in both active and inactive states, and the clinically relevant form of the analyte may depend on the diagnostic aim. For example, the active state of the placental hormone chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is the relevant molecule to measure in the diagnosis of pregnancy, whereas the biologically inactive free beta subunit (hCG-beta) is measured to diagnose choriocarcinoma. Generally, a measurement of biological activity is expressed in IU, whereas measurement of the amount of a protein or of a specific protein structure is expressed in SI. In this case there would be a compelling reason to relate the measurement of hCG to a unit of biological activity, and the measurement of hCG-beta to an SI unit of quantity. Accordingly WHO has established a reference preparation for hCG (currently the fourth International Standard, with an assigned content of 650 IU/ampoule) (7) and a reference preparation for hCG-beta (currently the first WHO Reference Reagent for immunoassay of hCG beta subunit, with an assigned content of 0.88nmol/ampoule) (18). The former preparation was assigned a value based on bioassay, whereas the latter preparation had been extensively characterized by physicochemical and
  immunological methods and calibrated in nanomol by amino acid analysis. Applying these considerations of the properties of biological analytes, and their measurement in the clinical situation allowed the WHO biological reference standard for hepatitis B surface antigen, assigned a value in arbitrary IU rather than in SI units, to be adopted by the medical devices sector of the European Commission as the standard required for the fulfilment of the so-called Common Technical Specifications (CTS) for in vitro diagnostic devices. The Common Technical Specification document supporting the European (IVD) Medical Devices Directive 98/79 EC is a legally binding document within the 25 countries of the European Union.
  Where it is appropriate for a WHO biological reference standard to be calibrated in SI units, the principles outlined in ISO 17511 (8) should be followed. This will necessitate the existence and use of an appropriate single reference method and an assignment of uncertainty, derived from calibration data. Such a reference method should not be a biological assay because the factors that affect the results of such assays are not fully understood. Where they are used, SI units assigned to biological reference standards should be derived from, and traceable to, physicochemical procedures.</p>

"How do I deal with sticky and viscous samples from cell lysates?","10003","","<p>To check a protein expression I pelleted a small amount of <em>E. coli</em> before and after induction and lysed them by redissolving them in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heating them to 95 °C for 1 minute.</p>

<p>This lead to a solution with some very sticky and viscous parts in it, that make pipetting the sample into the gel wells extremely annoying. As far as I heard, this is probably genomic DNA, and my usual way to deal with this is to centrifuge the samples and only pipet a small part out from the top. This does seem to help sometimes, but not always.</p>

<p>How can I avoid the formation of that sticky and viscious stuff or how can I avoid pipetting that stuff into my wells?</p>
","<p>Yes, it is the genomic DNA that is causing you trouble. Although a brief 1000g spin should bring it all down, the pellet is never tight and you almost always are going to pull up some gunk with the clear supernatant. A better solution is to include a quick sonication step (5-10s) before the 1000g spin. That way, the DNA is sheared and it should pellet better. It has worked for me most times. Also, remember to use a reasonable volume of SDS buffer when you lyse the cells. Too little buffer and its always going to be hard. For comparison, I use about 200ul per 1ml culture pellet and this volume works well for both pre- and post-induced cells.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bioavailability is the degree to which food nutrients are available
  for absorption and utilization in the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How would you explain this with an example?</p>
","<p>Bioavailability is a concept which applies to nutrients and drugs which pass through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-pass_metabolism"" rel=""noreferrer"">first-pass metabolism</a>, i.e. orally (and to some extent nasally) consumed substances. Anything absorbed in the gut first passes through the liver before reaching the rest of the circulation, and both the gut and liver may metabolise it to some extent. The liver in specific has the powerful <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P450"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cytochrome P450</a> system, a huge variety of enzymes to break down all sorts of substances, although in some cases it can actually produce more active or even toxic forms instead of breaking them down.</p>

<p>This can lead to drastic reductions in the amount available in the systemic circulation after oral administration. E.g. propanolol (a beta blocker) needs to be given in 100mg doses orally while intravenously (avoiding first-pass metabolism) only 5mg are needed.</p>

","<p>Neurons use lot of energy to maintain their polarized state, this is not required to other cells [1,2].</p>

<p>When O2 or blood flow (which is carrying the nutrients) is reduced, the neuronal ATP levels breaks down very fast, with 90% ATP depleted in less than 5 minutes.

","<p>In short, yes, the definitions are still correct:</p>

<p>The number of copies of a plasmid in the cell is determined by the mechanism of its replication: whether it is synchronized with the replication of the bacterial chromosome or is independent of it.</p>

<p>In the first case, the initiation of replication is performed by the same mechanisms of replication of the bacterial chromosome. This means that the origins of replication, as well as all proteins involved in the initiation of replication, are shared between the plasmid and the bacterial chromosome. For plasmids, which replication is synchronized with the replication of the bacterial chromosome are under <strong>stringent control of replication</strong>. The stringent control of replication is characteristics of plasmids with low copy number. These plasmids contain DNA regions called <em>par</em>-locuses (from partition) that control the correct division of the plasmids in the two daughter cells.</p>

<p>Plasmids with high copy number are under <strong>relaxed control of replication</strong>. These plasmids are replicated independently of the replication of the bacterial chromosome. They have individual mechanisms for initiation of replication. The plasmids themselves encode the initiation factors for replication, which are mainly RNA molecules. Once the plasmid replication is initiated, it continues with the same machinery used by the bacterial chromosome. </p>

It goes through some of the ethics of the data, but first lists some more of the ""experiments"" the Nazis performed.  To add to your list: high-altitude, sea water potability, tuberculosis, poisoning, artificial insemination, and numerous woundings.  They also did terrible things to twins.  Aside from being torturous and cruel, the ""experiments"" rarely if ever used anesthetics and were usually designed to kill the prisoner.</p>

<p>The article goes on to list a few case studies where some of the Nazi works came up and <em>could</em> have been considered, but were repeatedly shot down.  It then details a number of reasons why the ""experiments"" were worthless.  In particular,</p>

<ul>
<li>""[I]t is doubtful that physiological responses of the tortured and maimed victims represented the responses of the people for whom the experiments were meant to benefit.""</li>

<li>The results weren't ever actually published.</li>
<li>The ""data"" are inconsistent.</li>
</ul>

<p>The article moves into ethical arguments and hypotheticals, but ends up saying theoretically some of it could be considered, or that ""<em>Absolute censorship of the Nazi data does not seem proper, especially when the secrets of saving lives may lie solely in its contents.</em>""  It's a complicated scenario where that would arise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As part of the judgment, the court issued the celebrated Nuremberg Code in 1947—the first, shortest, and in many ways most uncompromising of the major ethical codes and regulations for the conduct of medical research on humans. Although the code had no legal authority in any country, it had great influence on ideas about human experimentation, and subsequent international codes and legislation.</p>

<p>In particular, the concept of ""informed consent"" is directly traceable to the Nuremberg Code:</p>

Other hypotheses say <em>homo</em> freed his hands to carry things. Quite fine, but some apes are known to carry around stuff. Moreover, walking on all fours increases running speed (you don't have to see far if you can escape faster) and apes climb trees better (what's a better place to hide from predators?).

<p>The earliest hominin fossils appear to have been bipedal, with no clear evidence of a transition through a knuckle-walking stage, the principal mode of locomotion of modern African ape.

<p>If this is true, then the modern African ape mode of locomotion (knuckle-walking) is a derived trait, and vertical body posture may be the ancestral trait in the African hominoid evolutionary lineages. In other words, if this is true, the ancestor of all great apes including humans was already bipedal, and modern African apes have evolved to knuckle-walk since then.

"Why cold water results in cough","9888","","<p>I have a pretty simple question which always kept me intriguing since childhood and I couldn't find its precise answer yet. Why do we cough by cold water. Recently I had flu and found very strange correlation between cold water and coughing. Even seconds after drinking cold[er] water, I started coughing as you all would have experienced as well. So why does it happen?</p>
","<p>I am no expert in this but I had asked my doctor the same question the last time I fell sick and I'll try to paraphrase his explanation. 
""There is this protective lining on our respiratory tract called ""Respiratory Mucosa"" that acts as the first line of defense against pathogens. But when you consume cold food and beverages , this membrane gets congested or shrinks such that it exposes the respiratory tract to pathogens . This is more prevalent if your body has an elevated temperature such as after spending a lot time outdoors during summer or after a workout. Cold food as such doesn't make you sick but they make it easier for the pathogens.""

<p>I think it is some sort of defense mechanism of the body.  But how does it help?</p>
","<p>Bee, or other insect stings/bites, will cause a reaction to occur due to chemicals being released from your immune system.  This can result in anywhere from a small bump to anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening if not treated right away.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kyqQF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>From <a href=""https://www.southerncross.co.nz/AboutTheGroup/HealthResources/MedicalLibrary/tabid/178/vw/1/ItemID/97/Bee-wasp-sting-allergies-and-analphylaxis.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Southern Cross Medical Library</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An anaphylactic reaction occurs when the body's antibodies respond to the insect venom by releasing chemicals such as histamine and serotonin that trigger the allergic reaction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever the reaction, it is correct to say that the reaction to an insect sting/bite is a defense mechanism of the body.  An interesting study done by Stanford University School of Medicine was done and discusses these <a href=""http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1112985062/allergy-to-bee-stings-a-defense-mechanism-102513/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">immune mechanisms</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Innate immune responses occur in subjects exposed to a foreign substance, such as a pathogen or a toxic material like venom, for the first time. [...] Immune cells called mast cells, which reside in most of the body’s tissues, are poised to unleash signals that turn on defense responses when a pathogen or toxin intrudes.  Prior immunization is not required for these types of innate immune responses, nor is the development of specific antibodies. In contrast, during an adaptive immune response, the immune system creates antibodies that can recognize the toxin or pathogen that is invading the animal’s system. Adaptive immunity is typically a faster, more specified and more effective form of defense than innate immunity, the research team explained.</p>

<p>More explanation of the <a href=""http://www.walgreens.com/adamHtml/bodyguides/reftext/html/immu_sys_fin.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-specific immune response</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a bee stings you, the presence of the bee venom triggers a nonspecific immune response. White blood cells arrive first on the scene to rid the body of bee venom antigens. As war wages between antigens and white blood cells, battle signs may appear on the affected skin. Inflammation (redness, swelling, heat, and pain) results as the body wards off invaders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oNIH8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the body detects an antigen that it previously met, a specific immune response occurs. In this response, the body has been trained to recognize and neutralize a familiar specific antigen; its immune system ""remembers"" the antigen. Such systemic (not restricted to the initial infection site) immunity enables a faster, longer lasting immune response than does a nonspecific response.</p>

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using beta-galactosidase compared to luciferase as a reporter gene?","9875","","<p>In the University labs, we have used Beta-galactosidase as a reporter gene to quantify the expression initiated by the stress-response promoter in yeast. This was done by exposing one of the two groups to osmotic stress (high salt concentration) whilst the other was unstressed. Then the levels of beta-galactosidase were compared. 
A question given to us afterwards asked to give advantages &amp; disadvantages of using Beta-galactosidase compared to Luciferase as a reporter gene in this experiment. And which one would be, overall, more suitable?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-galactosidase"" rel=""nofollow"">Beta-galactosidase</a> (B-gal for short) is an enzyme that will process the substrate lactose. In applications using B-gal as a reporter (lacZ gene), two lactose analogues are commonly used: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-gal"" rel=""nofollow"">X-gal</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortho-Nitrophenyl-%CE%B2-galactoside"" rel=""nofollow"">ONPG</a> (as pointed out by @Alan Boyd). Both substrates are colourless, becoming coloured once hydrolyzed by B-gal. The formation of this colour allows B-gal to be assayed by means of either visual inspection, or more accurate means by using a spectrophotometer or camera.</p>

<p>When X-Gal is hydrolyzed, an insoluble blue dye is formed. Evolution of blue colour is intensified as more substrate is hyrolyzed, allowing for quick blue/white screening by visual inspection in common applications of cloning and gene expression. Using the X-gal substrate, B-gal assays are more sensitive to gene expression (the dye precipitates out and retains colour very well), however X-gal is not quantitative (<a href=""http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00036/BTN_A_04365PT03_O_36496a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Möckli &amp; Auerbach. BioTechniques 36:872-876 (May 2004)</a>). In contrast, ONPG hydrolysis evolves a soluble yellow dye. This colour developement is quantitative, however is less senstive than X-gal because the linear relationship betwen light absorption (at 420 nm) and substrate concentration is small. Using ONPG as a B-gal substrate allows for quantitative measurement of B-gal activity (and therefore promoter activity). (Note that ONPG itself is not capable of inducing the lac promotor, unlike X-gal.)</p>

<p>Luciferase reporters (there are actually a few different luc genes) operate in a similar fashion. The enzyme cleaves its substrate, however instead of yielding an insoluble blue dye, emits a characteristic photon. Luciferase activity must be measured using specialized camera hardware to detect and count photons emitted from your yeast clones. This assay will still answer yes/no reporter questions, but can also be quantified to look at how much the reporter was activated. Luciferase activity is a quantitative reporter while also yielding spatiotemporal information.</p>

<p>The choice of reporters depends largely on the question you wish to answer. If promoter induction is relevant (eg, the stress-response promoter was activated), then luciferase or B-gal with X-gal are best suited for their higher sensitivity. Given that luciferase requires a special camera and optical filter (such as a gel documentation system), X-gal is ideal because it may be screened by eye. If promoter activity is being assayed, then B-gal+ONPG or luciferase will yield quantitative measurements of reporter gene activity, and require at least a spectrophotometer.</p>

<p>Given these are university labs, I assume that materials costs are to be minimized and ease of experimental protocol to be maximized, B-gal is the ideal reporter. Luciferase requires: more costly substrate; specialized equipment; careful handling of materials, and more time (as screening necessarily takes longer, therefore lower throughput for a lab demo setting).</p>

This means that some genes on the Barr body are expressed in XX-females, although often at lower levels compared to the active X-chromosome, and this is part of the normal gene dosage. The ""purpose"" of X-inactivation is usually dosage compensation, so that genes are expressed equally in males and females (and then actually upregulated in both sexes to balance autosomal genes, see e.g. <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.080149/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Dementyeva et al. 2009.

  ... ...
  <br>However, as many of the genes that escape from inactivation do not have Y-linked homologues, strict dosage compensation may not be necessary for all genes on the chromosome.

"Can HIV be transmitted via mosquitos?","9775","","<p>It is known that HIV is usually transmitted by direct blood or body fluid contact between an infected individual and a healthy person (like blood transfusion or needle sharing):</p>

<p>Suppose a mosquito bites an individual suffering from AIDS and in the process sucks up some T cells infected with HIV along with RBCs. Then it bites another person not suffering from the disease, and transfers these infected T cells. Isn't there a high probability of the second individual contracting HIV?</p>
","<p>No, this is not possible. There are a few reasons for that, but most important are that the only thing a mosquito injects is its own saliva, while the blood is sucked into the stomach where it is digested. </p>

<p>To be able to infect other people HIV would need to be able to leave the gut intact and then also be able to replicate in the mosquitos which it cannot do, due to the missing of the CD4 antigen on the surface of the insect cells. These are needed as a surface receptor for the virus to bind and enter the cells. This is also true for other blood sucking insects like bed bugs or fleas.</p>

<p>Other pathogens can do this, examples would be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever#Transmission"">Yellow fever</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria#Life_cycle"">Malaria</a>. In Yellow fever the virus first infects epithelial cells of the gut, then enters the blood system of the insect to finally end up in the salivary glands, where the virus is injected together with the saliva into the biten person. In Malaria the pathogen is also able to leave the gut region and mature in the salivary glands.</p>

<p>HIV can only be transmitted through blood (either through direct transmission, operations etc.), through semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. See reference 3.</p>

","<p>It can actually on very rare occasions however, it is also highly problematic and generally creates deleterious mutations and can inactivate genes. Depending on the location of the cell and the cross-over within the genome, it can also contribute to the formation of cancer. For instance, in the case of retinoblastoma, if there is one mutated copy of RAS on one chromosome and a normal copy on the other and mitotic crossing over occurs, then you can potentially remove the protective nonmutant copy of RAS from one of the daughter cells. This cell is then one step closer to becoming tumorgenic. </p>

","<p>A critical step in meiosis is the formation of tetrads. In diploid organisms like donkeys, they have a paternal version and a maternal version of each chromosome.

<p>In a hybrid, there are no matching maternal and paternal chromosomes. In the zebroid testes or ovary, a lonely donkey chromosome 2 is wandering around, looking for another donkey chromosome 2, and <strong>there isn't a homologous chromosome</strong>.

<p>Low pH (less than pH 1): both RNA and DNA hydrolyze (phosphodiester bonds break and the bases break off).</p>

<p>High pH (greater than pH 11): RNA hydrolyzes, DNA will denature but the phosphodieser backbone remains intact.</p>

<p>[salt]
Tm is sensitive to Na+ concentration.
Na+ acts to shield the negative charges of the sugar-phosophate backbone from interacting with one another. The repulsion between the negatively charged phosphate backbones is the major force destabilizing the double helix, therefore increasing Na+ concentration increases helix stability and decreasing Na+ concentration decreases helix stability.</p>

<p>The main function of lipoproteins is that of carrying lipids (=fats) around the organism in the blood. The problem is that lipids are not soluble in water (try to pour some oil in a glass of water) and blood is mainly composed of water. Lipoproteins, on the other hand, have a hydrophilic (=""water-loving"") exterior and a lipophilic (=""fat-loving"") interior, like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Chylomicron.svg/500px-Chylomicron.svg.png"" alt=""Structure of a chylomicron - from Wikipedia"">  </p>

<p>In the picture, the ""balls"" represent proteins, called apoproteins, and the C represent cholesterol and T tryglicerids, which are both lipids.
As you can see, all the fats are inside the lipoprotein, but the exterior, being soluble in water can be easily dissolved in the blood.</p>

<p>The biochemistry of lipoproteins is quite involved and I will not go into details here (but please leave a comment if you want further explanations) but, to simplify things:</p>

<ul>
<li>HDL bring lipids from the periphery back to the liver</li>
<li>LDL bring lipids from the liver to the periphery</li>
</ul>

<p>It is very important, at this point, to note that lipids are a physiologically important part of our organisms. All the cells in our body contain lipids: the membrane of each cell in the body is made up of lipids (called phospholipids) and also contain cholesterol. In fact, <strong>cholesterol is extremely important for the correct functioning of the body</strong> as, for instance, it is used as the base to make many hormones (the so-called steroid hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, cortisol, testosterone etc).</p>

<p>However, too high levels of lipids, particularly cholesterol, are not beneficial, as high cholesterol levels have been in fact linked to many cardiovascular diseases, which we hear a lot about these days.</p>

<p>So, because HDL tend to remove the lipids from the circulation and bring them back to the liver they can be considered as some sort of ""cleaners"", that remove excess cholesterol from circulation.</p>

"why is AUG the initiation codon?","9579","","<p>Is there any reason why AUG is the initiation codon  ?
Why is there a need for an initiation codon ? Can't translation start with different codons?</p>
","<p>A good question (if a little mixed up on transcription vs. translation!)</p>

<p>AUG is not always the start codon, but whatever the codon is it will always code for Methionine (or fMet, but still a variation on Met), even if the codon codes for a different amino acid otherwise. A  separate transfer RNA (tRNAi, the initiator tRNA) is used for the arrangement of this first step, guided by eIF2 [in eukarya].</p>

<p>In this respect it's less a question of ""why AUG"" than ""why this specific initiator tRNA"", the answer being that it's got certain sequence elements and modifications that distinguish it from the elongating tRNAs which bind elongation factors and hence are targeted to the ribosomal A and B sites instead of the ribosomal P site (with function being dependent on form, basically it's shaped to set up transcription rather than to elongate an existing nascent chain polypeptide).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Identity elements appear to finely tune the structure of the initiator tRNA, and growing evidence suggests that the body of the tRNA is involved in transmitting the signal that the start codon has been found to the rest of the pre-initiation complex."" — <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2795131/pdf/nihms-161803.pdf"">Kolitz and Lorsch, 2010</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other start codons are just from natural chemical variation (or evolution, whichever way you want to look at it) giving rise to different codon-recognising protein shapes.</p>

<p>The machinery for starting translation works, and as such is ""conserved"" - evolution has kept it, and that's why it is always the same codon (more or less). Archaea have a very similar shaped tRNAi acceptor stem, and is an equally good ligand, which shows how ancient the system is and gives an idea of how fundamentally difficult it must be for an organism to change a system like this through mutation (3.5 billion years of evolution can't be wrong! etc. haha).</p>

<p>Not to just gloss over the part where I said that non-AUG codons get used too (in yeast and mammalian cells), the following is from a study in which it was found changing 1 (and only 1) of the AUG bases still permitted translation initiation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Naturally occurring misrecognition indicates that discriminating two base-paired near-cognate codons from the perfect three-base-paired AUG
  codon is subject to mistakes. Mutations in translation
  initiation factors, such as eIF1 and eIF2b, further increase the levels of these mistakes.</p>
  
  <p>Two base-pairing interactions between non-AUG codons and the anticodon of
  the Met-tRNAi are sufﬁcient to trigger translation initiation, suggesting that wild-type eIF1 plays a role in
  monitoring proper base-pairing interactions when scanning for the AUG start site. It would be predicted that
  the Met-tRNAi, not a cognate tRNA matching an individual non-AUG codon, is used in translation initiation at these non-AUG start codons.</p>
  
  <p>The translation initiation complex will bind only the Met-tRNAi as
  opposed to other tRNAs because Met-tRNAi has unique
  sequence and structural features that allow it to be
  loaded onto eIF2 of the ternary complex and enable it

"How do lipid-soluble substances diffuse through the cell membrane?","9574","","<p>It’s said that water-soluble substances can diffuse through cell membrane with less ease than lipid-soluble substances because the former encounters impedance in the hydrophobic region of the phospholipid bilayer. However, does the same logic not apply for hydrophobic substances, in that they cannot traverse the hydrophilic outer/inner surfaces of the plasma membrane? How would they be able to enter or leave the cell with greater ease?</p>
","<p>See this paragraph and image from <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9847/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Cell: A Molecular Approach. 2nd edition.</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During passive diffusion, a molecule simply dissolves in the phospholipid bilayer, diffuses across it, and then dissolves in the aqueous solution at the other side of the membrane...Passive diffusion is thus a nonselective process by which any molecule able to dissolve in the phospholipid bilayer is able to cross the plasma membrane and equilibrate between the inside and outside of the cell. Importantly, only small, relatively hydrophobic molecules are able to diffuse across a phospholipid bilayer at significant rates (Figure 12.15). Thus, gases (such as O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>), hydrophobic molecules (such as benzene), and small polar but uncharged molecules (such as H<sub>2</sub>O and ethanol) are able to diffuse across the plasma membrane. Other biological molecules, however, are unable to dissolve in the hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer. Consequently, larger uncharged polar molecules such as glucose are unable to cross the plasma membrane by passive diffusion, as are charged molecules of any size (including small ions such as H<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup>). The passage of these molecules across the membrane instead requires the activity of specific transport and channel proteins, which therefore control the traffic of most biological molecules into and out of the cell.</p>

<p>As shown in above paragraph, molecules have to dissolve in phospholipid bilayer to diffuse through it. But since the hydrophilic part is already interacting with water, so dissolving is mainly for the hydrophobic part. Now, since hydrophobic part is non-polar, so it can dissolve only non-polar substances (<a href=""http://www.kentchemistry.com/links/bonding/LikeDissolveslike.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like dissolves like</a>). Thus, small gases like O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and non-polar molecules like benzene easily dissolve in hydrophobic part and diffuse through it. Also, molecules like water and ethanol can also dissolve in it in small amounts due to their small size and very less polarity. That's why only some molecules of water can diffuse passively, large amount of water would require <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaporin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aquaporins</a>. Now, since bigger molecules like glucose have large size and <a href=""http://www.800mainstreet.com/9/0009-002-process.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">high polarity</a>, they cannot dissolve in the membrane and thus require <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_channels"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">transmembrane channels</a> even for diffusion.

"When has an organism evolved enough to be called a new species?","9538","","<p>Imagine that we take a population of horses, split them in half and place them in completely different environments. The two species will evolve separate from each other and because the environment is different, the outcome of evolution will be different.</p>

<p>But at what point can you say that these horses have evolved into two different species?</p>

<p>(I do know that they would probably go extinct if we conducted this exact experiment, but this experiment is just to give an example)</p>
","<p>I think LuketheDuke's answer is an oversimplification of the biological species concept (possibly resulting from the dictionary having a poor definition). The definition he gives is one of many which are in current use, and is made redundant by many types of organism.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise that because reproduction is not the same process in all organisms, genetic differentiation between individuals occurs in different ways for different groups.</p>

<p>Let's take the definition given in LuketheDuke's answer...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The major subdivision of a genus or subgenus, regarded as the basic category of biological classification, composed of related individuals that resemble one another, are able to breed among themselves, but are not able to breed with members of another species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under this definition, lions and tigers (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger"">ligers</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiglon"">tiglons</a>, which are sterile hybrids between the two) would be considered one species, as would donkeys and horses (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule"">mules</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny"">hinnys</a>, again sterile hybrids). There are hundreds of other examples of pairs of animal species which can hybridise to produce sterile offspring.</p>

<p>However, these animal hybrids usually only take place with human intervention, by delibrate breeding efforts. Thus we could extend the previous definition to include them...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The major subdivision of a genus or subgenus, regarded as the basic category of biological classification, composed of related individuals that resemble one another, are able to breed among themselves, but <strong>do not breed freely with members of another species in the wild</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That last part takes care of the ligers and tiglons. But what if we consider plants? Under the definition I just gave, most grasses (around 11,000 species) would have to be considered as one species. In the wild, most grasses will freely pollinate related species and produce hybrid seed, which germinates. You might then think we could just modify the definition to specify that the offspring must be fertile (i.e. able to reproduce with one another)...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The major subdivision of a genus or subgenus, regarded as the basic category of biological classification, composed of related individuals that resemble one another, are able to breed among themselves, but <strong>do not breed freely with members of another species in the wild to produce fertile progeny</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, the situation is still more complicated (we've barely started!). Often wild hybridisation events between plants lead to healthy, fertile offspring. In fact common wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em>) is a natural hybrid between <strong>three</strong> related species of grass. The offspring are able to breed freely with one another.</p>

<p>Perhaps we could account for this by taking into account whether the populations <em>usually</em> interbreed, and whether they form distinct populations...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The major subdivision of a genus or subgenus, regarded as the basic category of biological classification, composed of <strong>populations or meta-populations of</strong> related individuals that resemble one another, are able to breed among themselves, but <strong>do tend not to breed freely with members of another species in the wild to produce fertile progeny</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This accounts for the grasses, but it still leaves a messy area when you have a hybridisation which establishes - until the hybrid population is segregated away from the parent populations it is unclear whether they still count as the same species.</p>

<p>We could probably live with this situation, except for the fact that bacteria refuse to conform to it at all. Bacteria of the same species, or even very different species, can freely transfer genes from one to the other in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation"">conjugation</a>, which combined with fission can result in perfectly replicable hybrids. This is such a common occurence that it breaks even the 'tend to' part of the previous definition, and members of a population can be doing this almost constantly, which negates the segregation requirement.</p>

<p>Richard Dawkins had a go at defining around this, by stating that...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>two organisms are conspecific if and only if they have the same number of chromosomes and, for each chromosome, both organisms have the same number of nucleotides </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This partly gets around the bacterial problem and means that bacteria which result from conjugation are a new species. Unfortunately under this definition we might as well not ever bother trying to classify bacteria as billions of new species would be created every day - something which the medical profession might have something to say about. This definition would also mean that those with genetic diseases like trisomy 21 are not human. The final nail in the coffin of this attempt is that there are many species, including frogs and plants, which are very certainly considered a single species by taxonomists but which have some variety in the presence of small accessory chromosomes, which occur in different combinations between individuals.</p>

<p>Let's consider one last option. We now live in the era of genomics where data about genomes of thousands of organisms is accumulating rapidly. We could try to use that data to build a species definition based upon similarity at the nucleotide level. This is often used for bacteria, by considering organisms with less than 97% nucleotide similarity to be different species.</p>

<p>The major point I've been trying to make, though, is that species is not a natural concept. Humans need to be able to classify organisms in order to be able to structure our knowledge about them and make it accessible to people trying to link ideas together. But the natural world doesn't care about our definitions. Ultimately the species concept is different for different groups of organisms and will continue to change over time as our analytical methods and the requirements of our knowledge change. Note that I've deliberately skipped over many historical species concept ideas.</p>

"Why do parasites sometimes kill their hosts?","9538","","<p>It's bothered me for a while now. I understand why a parasitoid would do this, as it only temporarily requires the host, and that not all parasites kill their hosts.</p>

<p>There seems to be no evolutionary advantage in killing a host, because the parasite relies on the host for resources. Yet some organisms, usually microscopic pathogens, seem to fatally damage the host with no immediate benefit to themselves. Why is this? </p>

<p>I know this is asking for a broad soft answer, but I don't want the question to get bogged down by a specific species, although bonus points for using examples.</p>
","<p>I can think of several (non-exclusive and non-exhaustive) hypotheses:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Maladaptive</strong>. It is maladaptive. Because it is a new virus coming from another species or because it is not adapted to our modern lifespan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit of the host immune system to the parasite</strong>. Some parasites might benefit from host immune defense (sneezing helps bacteria to spread) and death is a consequence of the selection for increasing disease symptomes to the host.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pathogen's and host's fate</strong>. The pathogen's fate is not linked to the host's fate. This is espacially true if the pathogens spread well (easily jump from one host to another) I guess or for parasitoïd because the pathogen leave its parasitic life after the death of its single host.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>intra- and inter-host selection</strong>. Among hosts, there might have a selection for reducing ressource consumptions and therefore for decreasing the probability for the host to die. But within a host (among individuals of a parasite population or even among parasite species), it is a prisoner's dilemna (tragedy of the commons). The more you invest into foraging, the more competitive you are. This might not be adaptative at the population level but it is at the individual level. We might think of this prisoner's dilemna happening among individuals of a single parasite species or among several parasite species. You may want to have a look at the work of Martin Nowak on the subject incl. Consider for example his book; <a href=""https://www.amazon.ca/Evolutionary-Dynamics-Exploring-Equations-Life/dp/0674023382/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1491419447&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=martin%20nowak%20dynamic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Evolutionary Dynamics</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consequence of harming on trade-offs</strong>. Harming an individual will cause him not to spend energy into reproduction in order that more energy is available for the pathogen use. Moreover, by causing symptoms, the infected individual will be sexually less attractive and will again have less opportunity to spend energy into reproduction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The pathogen does not mean much harm</strong>. When fighting a pathogens, many of the symptoms we experience (such as fever typically) are actually caused by the immune system and not the pathogen itself. A maladaptive overreaction of the immune system can cause our death.</p></li>

At a few degrees away from it their density rises to a high value and spreads over a large area of the retina.

<h2>Stuffy nose</h2>

<p>Congestion in nose is a passive and local process resulting from reduced outflow of blood from a nasal tissue.
The nasal epithelium is very thin which makes it vulnerable to flu and cold.
The viral particle passes through the membrane (often because of scarring) and causes the change in the vascular permeability of the surrounding big vein.
Mechanisms of stuffy nose are covered partially by Ram and Aleadam:</p>

<ul>
<li>local edema </li>
<li>because of changed vascular permeability of large veins surrounding the nose</li>
<li>bradykinin</li>
<li>histamine (cetiritzin)</li>
<li>counteracted by epinephrine</li>
</ul>

<p>which respond against viral particles and cause</p>

<ul>
<li>atrophy </li>
<li>dryness of nose.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stuffy nose is about the reduced outflow of blood from a nasal tissue i.e. <strong>isolated venous obstruction</strong>.
Even small obstruction (scarring) can lead to it. 
I know no safe systemic medication that can prevent the change of vascular permeability of the nasal big vein.
Local steroids like Nasonex improve the recovery time by reducing the congestion when taken during long term - however, it cannot prevent the vascular permeability change of the large vein.
I have an intuition that the the nasal venous congestion can be relieved by the <strong>systemic lymphatic drainage massage</strong> by special movements involving</p>

<ul>
<li>abdomen (attention to deep breathing with abdomen and exhale too)</li>
<li>supraclaviculus</li>
<li>under medial occipitalis</li>
<li>under auricles</li>
</ul>

<p>which help to drain the accumulated fluid from the nasal tissues.
I know no substitute or medication to replace the stimulation of lymphatic drainage.</p>

<p><strong>Prophylactics for the symptoms</strong></p>

<p>You can oil your membranes but to oil them all even at the back side is difficult - even more difficult if have to have them oiled continuously.
So there remains some membranes unoiled.
I think it takes rather much time for the venous side to recover.
Therefore, you feel stuffy nose long time after the runny nose has ended.
Local oiling is not enough during cold and allergic times for many patients.
Some medicines for Prophylactics</p>

<ul>
<li>Xylometazoline (Olynth) - cause atrophy and dryness, but good for stuffy nose </li>
<li>Quixx - sea water</li>
<li>Eucalyptus and vitamin E (Coldises spray for instance)</li>

"How to prepare sample for SDS PAGE?","9323","","<p>I usually take my protein sample 0.8ml and sample buffer(2X) 0.2ml for my sample preparation in SDS PAGE. Am I using correct proportion? my protein sample concentration is 4.1mg/ml. What is the standard protocol?</p>
","<p>Sample preparation for protein gels is not a complex task. Simply mix the appropriate amount of sample buffer with your sample and load it. For a 2x sample buffer use equal amounts of sample and buffer, for 5x sample buffer use 4 parts of sample and 1 part of buffer (for examle 40µl + 10µl). Heat the mixed samples for 5 minutes at 95°C, cool them immediately on ice and load an appropriate amount of it on the gel. How much is possible really depends on the type of gel you use - 20-30µl should usually be possible.</p>

<p>Do not load too much protein, otherwise you will not be able to seperate them appropriately. I usually use between 20-30µg of total protein per well or as little as 50ng for purified proteins (this depends on the antibodies as well).</p>

<p>Have a look on this <a href=""http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bioslabs/studies/sds-page/gellab2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">webpage</a> for some further information.</p>

<p>For sample buffers I usually use the following recipes. I prefer the 5x, because I can load more protein, if the preparation is not very good. I also prefer the use of DTT to Mercaptoethanol, as it is much less smelly. If you have no DTT (or prefer mercaptoethanol) it can be replaced by an equal amount (200mM in the 2x, 500mM in the 5x buffer). If you use DTT, you need to make aliquots of the buffer and store it at -20°C, a working aliquot can be kept at 4°C for two weeks or so.</p>

<p><strong>2x sample buffer:</strong></p>

"Why is FAD, rather than NAD+, reduced in the succinate dehydrogenase reaction of the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle?","9295","","<p>FADH<sub>2</sub> is produced in the conversion of Succinate to Fumarate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Why is this so? Why not NADH?</p>
","<p>In general, $NADH$ and $FADH_2$ are coenzymes. The structure of the main part of an enzyme determines which coenzyme or which prosthetic group will work with the concerned enzyme. Unlike most other TCA cycle enzymes, Succinic Dehydrogenase involves the participation of $FAD$ rather than $NAD$ and that is a consequence of its specific structure.  </p>

<p>Another possible reason might have to do with the energy gap available. The conversion of succinate to fumarate liberates less free energy as compared to other oxidation reactions. Ususally, the steps which are coupled with NADH reduction have a free energy change of about $\Delta G=-100$ to $-150Kcal/mol$ but the conversion catalysed by succinic dehydrogenase has a free energy change of $-80Kcal/mol$ (rough figures) and hence releases less energy. It therefore might not be feasible to couple with $NADH$ reduction but it would be favourable (thermodynamically) to couple with an easy-to-reduce (since the reduction potential is higher and hence reduction is more favourable) and hence less energetic molecule $FADH_2$.  </p>

<p>Apart from structural and thermodynamic requirement, one last possible reason might be that succinic dehydrogenase is a part of the mitochondrial membrane and involved in the Electron Transport Chain. Here, flavin molecules are excellent electron transporters (in comparison to nicotinamide based reductants) and therefore it might be more profitable to use a flavin based reductant to later facilitate easy electron transport and proton transfer.<br>
Again all these are probable reasons and I dont know for sure.</p>

They didn't make any comments about the microcentrifuge tube popping open or broken parafilm, so nothing crazy happened but something did.</p>

<p>What's the most reliable way to ship plasmids?</p>
","<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the 10 uL of plasmid miniprep may have been splattered in the cap of the tube (AnnaF)</li>
<li>the eppendorf tube may have depressurized during air shipment and allowed the 10 uL to escape and evaporate</li>
<li><strong>solution:</strong> try air-drying or blotting (Jonas) your minipreps prior to air shipment </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>As AnnaF wrote, the 10 uL of your plasmid could have been hidden in the cap or dispersed around the tube, making appear empty.  You should check with your collaborators to be sure they centrifuged it.</p>

<p>According to a <a href=""http://www.fedex.com/us/services/pdf/PKG_Pointers_Perishable.pdf"">fedex document on shipping perishables (pdf)</a> and a <a href=""http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&amp;context=it_fac"">paper measuring the temp and pressure of air shipments (pdf)</a>, fedex and ups air shipments may experience low pressure environments around 0.56 - 0.74 atmospheres (atm).  At these relatively low pressures, perhaps an eppendorf tube sealed at 1 atm might breach.  The papers also note that ground shipments that pass over the rockies (i.e. in Colorado) may experience ~ 0.64 atm.</p>

<p>So perhaps your 1.5 ml eppendorf tube depressurized during the shipment?</p>

<p>It would be interesting to do some tests on the pressure-worthiness of eppendorf tubes.</p>

<p>Regarding the original question, in 2007 I prepared and shipped (fedex) a library of thousands of minipreps to hundreds of users.  1uL of miniprep was dispensed into wells of 384-well plates and airdried, then sealed with aluminum, then mailed.

"Why and where do red blood cells die?","9195","","<p>Textbooks commonly state that red blood cells are removed by the liver and spleen. Do those organs destroy the red blood cells within capillaries that course through those organs or are they transported into the liver/spleen cells to be broken down into their constituents? What causes them to be destroyed/removed from the circulation?</p>
","<p>RBC's lifespan is about 120 days. RBC's don't have a nucleus or endoplasmic reticulum, but they do have enzymes in the cytoplasm, capable of producing ATP from glucose. This energy is used mostly to maintain the structure and flexibility of the cell. The erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, that is ~7 micrometers in diameter, but the cell is pliable and it should be able to squeeze trough narrow spaces without breaking the cell membrane. Over time these metabolic systems become less effective and damaged, and the cell slowly becomes more fragile and prone to rupture. Spleen has special trabeculae (bands of connective tissue) in its red pulp, that the blood passes trough. The spaces between them are narrow and ""old"" RBC's tend to rupture while trying to squeeze trough. Then macrophages ""catch"" any cell fragments down the stream. This can happen anywhere in the body, but spleen and liver are kind of filters for blood contents.</p>

"Why is ATP produced in photosynthesis used to synthesize glucose?","9176","","<p>In photosynthesis ATP is produced in light-dependent reactions only to go to the Calvin cycle to be turned into glucose to make ATP during respiration:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/z8sJx.jpg"" alt=""atp and glucose as used in photosynthesis""></p>

<p>Why isn't this ATP just directly released into the cell? Is there a benefit to using the ATP to make glucose? Also, ATP can be made in the chloroplasts with cellular respiration? What happens to this ATP?</p>
","<p>As far as I can understand your question, you wish to know why a plant cell consumes ATP to produce glucose when it can directly use the ATP as an energy molecule. </p>

<p>ATP is an energy currency and is required in different biochemical pathways. However, it is not a good energy storage molecule. Following are the reasons why production of an energy molecule such as glucose is essential:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not all parts of the plant are photosynthetic. These non-photosynthetic plants need an alternate source of energy. Since ATP is unstable, it cannot be transported to different parts of the plant without degradation.</li>
<li>Since photosynthesis cannot happen in the dark, the plants would require some energy molecule that can be utilized later on, in the dark conditions.</li>
<li>Chloroplasts themselves require ATP in the dark conditions. They express an ATP-ADP translocase that actually imports ATP from the cytosol while pumping out ADP+P<sub>i</sub> <br>(See <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21622019"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> review). </li>
<li>Plants also need energy storage for seeds. This storage is usually in the form of starch (a polymer of glucose).</li>
<li>Glucose is required for synthesis of cellulose which makes the cell wall of plants.</li>
<li>The glycolytic pathway (including pentose phosphate pathway) produces important metabolites such as ribose (in the form of PRPP, which is important for nucleotide synthesis), pyruvate (which is used to synthesize alanine) etc.</li>
<li>Glucose and some glycolytic metabolites (such as glycerol) also serve as osmolytes i.e. they maintain osmotic pressure in the cell. </li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, points 4-7 convey that Calvin-Benson cycle not only produces sugar but what it actually does is fix inorganic carbon (as CO<sub>2</sub>) to organic form (in the form of sugar). So, most (practically all) of the carbon that a photosynthetic plant has, comes from this carbon fixation process and that's how plants are photoautotrophic.</p>

<p>Am I missing something, or is this claim false?</p>
","<p>This is an interesting topic!  </p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassulacean_acid_metabolism"" rel=""nofollow"">Crassulacean acid metabolism</a> is a second CO₂ fixation pathway where <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fixation#CAM_plants"" rel=""nofollow"">CO₂ is absorbed at night</a>.  The CO₂ is fixed into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malic_acid"" rel=""nofollow"">maleic acid</a> HOOC-CH₂CH(OH)-COOH which stores some of the CO₂ in the form of carboxyl groups.

<p>This is an adaptation where the stomata open at night to take in the CO₂ and are closed during the day - the plants sort of 'hold their breath'.

Its interesting to note that this is found in a wide variety of plants ""CAM is found in five taxonomic classes, comprising monocots and dicots, encompassing 33 families and 328 genera"".

"Can a carnivorous animal consume plants with no adverse effects?","9141","","<p>While I know that in nature, carnivorous animals are poorly suited to eat plants (largely due to having sharp teeth, not grinding teeth, as far as I know), I was wondering if, in an emergency situation such as imminent starvation, <strong>could a carnivorous animal such as a wolf survive <em>solely</em> on plant life</strong>, maybe requiring it to be ground up before hand? <strong>Could an herbivore survive on meat, if the meat was prepared in a manner that would allow the herbivore to eat it?</strong> Would a wild animal voluntarily consume food that it is not suited for if it would stave off certain death, or would it require force feeding or training?</p>

<p>Also, I am interested in the other side of this question: <em>if an animal cannot safely consume food outside of its normal diet</em> (carnivore eating plants, herbivores consuming meat), <strong>what negative effects would this action have on the animal?</strong></p>

<p><em>Just a note, this is purely a hypothetical question, and I am only asking out of curiosity. I am in no way planning on doing this, nor do I advise anyone else doing this if there is a high chance of it harming the animal.</em></p>
","<p>This is kind of a weird/trick question.  How long do you want the animal to live?  If the lifespan is shortened or compromised does that fit....   Obligate carnivores (cats, dogs) do eat plant material.  In the wild cats mainly eat grass to get rid of hairballs.  Cats are more impacted by phytotoxins than dogs.  However, both, are extremely vulnerable to compounds that don't bother humans (xanthines like theobromine, caffine, compounds in garlic, onions, broccoli, mushrooms).  Cats can't convert plant fats into what they need (we can) as a result they can go blind if they don't get the animal fats they need.  Likewise, herbivores will suffer increased cancer, heart disease, renal failure from diets with animal fats / protein.  Your mention of ""wolf"" is interesting because there is a South American wolf that supplements its diet with a tomato relative (called something like ""fruit for wolves"" in Spanish).  This is probably only ""good"" for it in that it keeps the wolf from otherwise starving.  I don't know that it has a strong deleterious effect (probably not, but it could be more sensitive to trace alkaloids in the fruit) but it could hurt it in a minor way.</p>

<p>I do not have biological background. Please confirm whether it is correct. If we have a transcript, which is from sense strand, when RNA-seq is producing reads, is that first the cDNA is synthesised. Then this cDNA is used for PCR to amplify the sample? Then the reads generated could be from both strands of the original DNA? </p>

<p>For strand-specific protocols, what is different?</p>

<p>========================================================</p>

<p>Follow up.</p>

<p>Please correct me if I am wrong. There are multiple protocols to produce strand-specific RNA-seq libraries. The basic process is like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the RNA;</li>
<li>Get its cDNA;</li>
<li>Somehow mark the cDNA as sense or antisense when amplifying (PCR?) (here comes the differences between different protocols);</li>
<li>Then REMOVE all antisense (or sense) cDNAs;</li>
<li>Read the reads from clean cDNA library.</li>
</ol>

<p>The result is that, the reads from this RNA can be used to assemble the sense cDNA. And for not strand-specific libraries, using the reads would be able to assemble both the anti-sense and sense cDNA. </p>

<p>Am i right about this problem? Thanks.</p>
","<p>It may be worth checking out the paper ""<a href=""http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v7/n9/full/nmeth.1491.html"">Comprehensive comparative analysis of strand-specific RNA sequencing methods</a>"".</p>

<p>The most common techniques sequentially ligate different RNA adapters to the 5' and 3' ends of each RNA molecule prior to cDNA synthesis.  You will end up with an RNA molecule that looks like this (where A and B are the two adapters):</p>

<pre><code>  5'-AAAAAA---------------BBBBBB-3'
</code></pre>

<p>These adapters are then used for cDNA synthesis and library preparation.  Finally, since each adapter is ligated to a specific end of the RNA the library can be generated in a stand-specific fashion; ie. the reads derived from the antisense strand <strong>should</strong> align to the antisense strand of the genome.</p>

<p>So, what is wrong here? Or is it because of some other reason why alcohol inhibits gluconeogenesis and leads to hypoglycemia?</p>
","<p>Yes, this is the effect of metabolizing ethanol and also the reason why excess ethanol can lead to hypoglycemia.</p>

<p>Ethanol is oxidized by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dehydrogenase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alcohol dehydrogenase</a> to acetaldehyde. This reaction consumes one molecule of NAD<sup>+</sup> per molecule ethanol oxidized: </p>

<pre><code>Ethanol + NAD+ &lt;=&gt; Acetaldehyde + NADH + H+
</code></pre>

<p>Acetaldehyde is oxidized by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde_dehydrogenase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">acetaldehyde dehydrogenase</a> in a second reaction in the mitochondria to Acetyl-CoA, which produces another molecule of NADH:</p>

<pre><code>Acetaldehyde + NAD+  + CoA &lt;=&gt; Acetyl-CoA + NADH + H+
</code></pre>

<p>If you now take a look at gluconeogenesis, there is one critical step which needs NAD<sup>+</sup>: the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lactate dehydogenase</a> which then cannot be processed into oxalacetate, phosphoenolpyruvate and so on. </p>

<p>Adding excess NADH shifts the reaction equilibrium completely to the side of lactate and also leads to the production of additional lactate, leading to hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Excess NADH from the ethanol oxidation inhibits the oxidation of fatty acids in the liver - this process also generates NADH for the production of ATP. NADH signals this process that enough energy is available in the cell.

<p>The current <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgi%27s_method"">wikipedia article</a> says the mechanism is still not fully understood. What is preventing us from using the advanced molecular biology techniques to understand the process?</p>
","<p><strong>Some background information.</strong></p>

<p>First of all one should notice, that Golgi staining belongs to so-called morphological types of stainings in neuroscience, where the actual anatomy of different neurons is revealed (compared to other techniques, like Ca-imaging or potential imaging).</p>

<p>Second, Golgi staining is a type of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_staining"">silver staining</a>, there the sedimentation of silver or its salts (here: silver chromate) reveals the morphological traits of the cels. </p>

<p>And, third, Golgi staining is applied to fixed preparation. This means that the tissue (normally a brain slice) is pre-treated (here: with formol) to kill all cells and arrest every biological process.</p>

<p><strong>What is known about the targets.</strong></p>

<p>The common description of the target is <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017307000033"">quoted</a> as ""a limited number of cells at random in their entirety"". This is the essence of Golgi staining:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Only single cells are stained</strong>, therefore there is no impediment from adjacent cell staining while deriving the morphological structure of the cells (very important for light microscopy where you have integrated input from different depths).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The cells are stained randomly</strong>, there is no known preference among neuronal cells for Golgi staining and I haven't seen any other types of cells in CNS stained with Golgi, therefore it is quite <strong>specific for neuronal cells</strong> (and leaving macro- and microglia, astrocytes etc. intact).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The cells are stained in their entirety</strong>, meaning that the complete cell is stained very nicely, showing detailed arborisation of dendritic tree, that was very important in studying of Purkinje cells in cerebellum.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Are larger neurons more likely to be stained? Are specific cell types more susceptible than others?</strong></p>

<p>Golgi staining is used mostly for brain slices (I have never seen or heard its application for other tissues). Traditionally one of the biggest cells here are pyramid neurons (NA, ACh-ergic) and one of the smallest are interneurons (often GABA-ergic) -- both are amenable to Golgi staining (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006899383910764"">reference</a>) and there is no seemingly clusterization of stained cells by their size or transmitter type.</p>

<p><strong>What is preventing us from using the advanced molecular biology techniques to understand the process?</strong></p>

<p>I can name several reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Since Golgi staining is applied to fixed preparation the tissue is already ""damaged"" (formol leads to dessication of cells and shrumping), therefore it is difficult to use some fine mollecular biology methods to investigate these tissues.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no way to tell which cells get stained beforehand. And as long as  the microcrystallisation of silver chromate is started it can't be (easily) stopped and reversed. Therefore it is difficult to look at what caused the staining afterwards, then the whole cell is impregnated with silver.</p></li>
<li><p>I think there were no real attempts to crack the mistery of this staining: how intersting it might be, this seems to be an interdisciplinary question on the brink between biology and chemistry. So, maybe one day somebody will look into it and explain everything.</p></li>

<p>Added info: The water is heated in the water heater which is in the basement of my house. It is a new water heater, only a year old. My house is built 7 years ago, which for a house it's not old. I don't know about the pipes though</p>
","<p>This actually depends on how your tap water is warmed. 
If you have a personal water heater, which is connected to your tap with non-corrodable pipes, then there is essentially no difference. </p>

<p>However, if the heating comes from a common source, then it would be very difficult to verify that the heater-tap connection does not contain any corrodable pipes. In this case, it might be better to not use the warm water for direct drinking, especially if the building is old.</p>

<p>A 7-year old house should not have lead pipes installed, since the <a href=""http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/water-eau/lead-plomb-eng.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Canadian Plumbing Code</a> has banned lead pipes since 1975. As such, I believe that your warm water is safe to drink. </p>

  <p>The National Plumbing Code allowed lead as an acceptable material for pipes until 1975 and in solder until 1986. All provinces and territories use the National Plumbing Code as a basis for their own regulations.</p>

"why is DNA antiparallel? Can it be parallel?","9039","","<p>My biology textbook mentions that DNA is antiparallel and it got me wondering... Can DNA be parallel? What would happen if it was parallel? could DNA still replicate right?</p>
","<p>Interestingly the answer is yes. The problem with parallel strands is that the DNA is not pairing in the known way it does when it is combined anti-parallel (or Watson-Crick-pairs). 
I have found different images illustrating the problems:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/t3prj.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This article (""<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC101824/"">NMR structure of a parallel-stranded DNA duplex at atomic resolution</a>"") shows a more schematic solution of this problem by showing the single pairings.

<p>Purple bacteria and cyanobacteria are some of the oldest known lineages (>3BY, whereas Mitochondria parallel Eukaryotic origins at about 1.4BY - and the endosymbiosis which created Chloroplasts probably came after [plants have <em>both</em> Chloroplasts <strong>and</strong> Mitochondria, whereas most Eukaryotes just have Mitochondria]), and since the respiratory chain and photosynthetic chain share identical proteins in cyanobacteria and purple bacteria it's not a huge leap to assume that - yup - the 5-protein structure is probably the template used by both Chloroplasts and Mitochondria because of a common source.</p>

If they would grow with each other, then I could theoretically grow a line of closely spaced fruit trees to any length, and they would be strengthened by each other in bad conditions. </p>
","<p>There are a couple of answers to this question.  Especially where trees are concerned, you can graft <a href=""http://inventorspot.com/articles/lemon_tree_japan_bears_eleven_ki_9572"" rel=""noreferrer"">two or more trees onto the same rootstock, or even a single limb into a tree</a>. </p>

<p>But if the graft takes, it won't behave too much more differently than just more branches of the same tree.  Structurally intertwining them will not be different than if you had just taken a single tree's branches to support each other.  The graft will usually only have a single set of roots, from the host tree.  They will not compete.  The tendency will be for the branches to grow apart so that they can independently get their own light.  This is very much like any other single tree.  Not sure about fusing two halves of a tree together - exposing the roots would tend to kill the tree or unsettle it. </p>

"How should species density be calculated for a clumped distribution?","8981","","<p>Lets imagine 5 plots of different size are sampled for a target species:</p>

<pre><code>plot#  count  area(m^2)  plot_density
  1      1       5         0.2
  2      3       2         1.5
  3      0      10         0.0
  4      5       1         5.0
  5      2       6         0.33
</code></pre>

<p>What is this species' density?  I see two ways to calculate the density that give completely different values.  </p>

<p>The first way averages the density at each plot:</p>

<p>$$
\frac{\Sigma(\frac{count_i}{area_i})}{5} = 1.41/m^2
$$ </p>

<p>This seems <em>OK</em> but it doesn't do much to control for changing plot sizes.  For example if plot 3 above was 10 times larger the density would still be the same.  In a situation where plot sizes are determined by the environment (say, under natural cover objects) this seems less than ideal. </p>

<p>The second way totals the counts and the search area and divides them:<br>
$$
\frac{\Sigma(count_i)}{\Sigma(area_i)}=0.46/m^2
$$</p>

<p>I prefer the second method because it seems to describe the animals' density more accurately. And I would be happy to use the second method, but my issue is that I am unsure how to calculate a summary statistic for method two since a mean was never calculated.  Method one gives a standard deviation of 2.1. What is the standard deviation for method two??   </p>

<p>One possible solution I've come up with involves breaking the larger plots into 1m^2 plots and dividing the number of animals across those smaller plots.  So now I have 24 1m^2 plots with the following ""counts"":  </p>

<pre><code>plot#  count  area(m^2)  plot_density
1-5      0.2       1         0.2
6-7      1.5       1         1.5
8-17     0.0       1         0.0
18       5.0       1         5.0
19-24    0.33      1         0.33 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, using the first equation above I get:
$$
\frac{\Sigma(\frac{count_i}{area_i})}{24} = 0.73/m^2
$$ 
With a standard deviation of 1.26.  </p>

<p>Is this a reasonable approach?  Is there an established solution to this problem?</p>
","<p>To me, there are two issues that are mixed up here (if I understand you correctly). First, do you want to estimate the mean and variance for a statistical population (i.e. to characterize a larger population by independent samples), or do you want to calculate the actual density for a particular area, where you have counted all occurences in that entire area (but maybe divided the area into subareas out of convenience when counting)? This is not clear from your question.</p>

<p>In the second case, your second option of pooling counts and areas is suitable. However, then you have only calculated the actual density in that particular area (ignoring issues of detectability of the organism when counting), and you cannot draw any inferences about a larger statistical population.</p>

<p>If your aim is to draw inferences for a larger statistical population, a start is to calculate the mean and standard deviation (sd) of your sample. In that case, I assume that your samples are chosen randomly and independently from a larger statistical population. Your first option is then the right approach. However, since your samples have different sizes, you might want to attach more weight to larger samples, since they can be assumed to better describe the population average than smaller samples. This is called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean"" rel=""nofollow"">weighted mean</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, the weighted arithmetic mean is defined as: </p>

<p>$$\bar{x}_w = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^nw_ix_i}{\sum_{i=1}^nw_i}$$</p>

<p>where $w_i$ are the weights for each sample ($x_i$) and $n$ are the number of samples. Using this formula, you will arrive at exactly the same value for the weighted mean as you calculated in your second attempt (0.458), if you use the areas as weights. </p>

<p>The weighted standard deviation is a bit more problematic, in the sense that there doesn't exist one single standard way of calculating this. However, a commonly used formula is:</p>

<p>$$ \sigma_{w_1} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n w_i (x_i - \bar{x}_w)^2 }{ \frac{(M-1)}{M} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i } },$$</p>

<p>where $M$ are the number of nonzero weights. Other definitions of the weighted standard deviation can be found at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Weighted_sample_variance"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia: weighted sample variance</a>.</p>

<p>Another version is defined as (called ""reliability weights"" on the wiki page):</p>

<p>$$ \sigma_{w_2} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n w_i (x_i - \bar{x}_w)^2 }{  \sum_{i=1}^n w_i - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}}},$$</p>

<p>If I haven't made a mistake, these will give the standard deviations 1.15 and 1.22, using your data.</p>

<p>As for the <strong>biological interpretation</strong>, all calculations of average densities indicate a clumped distribution, since the coefficient of variation (CV) is larger than 1 (CV = sd/mean), but more so if you use a weighted mean. The CV using the arithmetric mean is 1.5, while it is 2.5-2.65 for the weighted mean, which is reasonable since you are giving more weight to the large area sample with a zero count. However, I should also note that you should be cautious about using a weighted mean when you have a strongly clumped distribution, since your run the risk that e.g. a large sample plot land on an area with no occurences, which might bias your density estimate. Generally, when you have a clumped distribution, you need to sample more intensively to get a good estimate of average density, and many small samples is often better than a few large ones.</p>

"Are there any animals that are both poisonous and venomous?","8960","","<p>From my layman understanding, animals that inject venom into the bloodstream by biting or poking are venomous. And ones that harm you when you eat them are poisonous.</p>

","<p>That is certainly an interesting question! </p>

<p>First, to clarify definitions:</p>

<p>To be considered venomous the toxic substance must be produced in specialized glands or tissue. Often these are associated with some delivery apparatus (fangs, stinger, etc.), but not necessarily.</p>

<p>To be poisonous, the toxins must be produced in non-specialized tissues and are only toxic after ingestion.</p>

  <p>DNA damages and mutation are fundamentally different. <strong>Damages are physical abnormalities</strong> in the DNA... [and] can be recognized by enzymes, and, thus, they <strong>can be correctly repaired</strong> if redundant information, such as the undamaged sequence in the complementary DNA strand or in a homologous chromosome, is available for copying.... In contrast to DNA damage, a <strong>mutation is a change in the base sequence of the DNA</strong>. A mutation <strong>cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and, thus, a mutation cannot be repaired</strong>.</p>

<p>Is it just a new term for the same thing, or is it something different? Does one of the two terms encompass the other?</p>
","<p>My understanding is that synthetic biology is genetic engineering 2.0. The difference is in the approach. Whereas genetic engineering projects are usually ad hoc, synthetic biology aims to apply proper engineering principles such as standardisation, modularisation, and reusability. Synthetic biologists create and use libraries of standard parts that are characterised, so they can be easily reused in projects. A part could be a gene, a terminator, a promoter, etc. </p>

<p>Synthetic biology also has greater ambitions. The focus is on creating whole systems/circuits of genetic regulation. This means there is a need for computational modelling and understanding of how biological systems work. In this aspect synthetic biology is a sister of systems biology a bit like synthetic chemistry (engineering) is a sister of chemistry (science).</p>

<p>You could of course argue that it's just a marketing ploy to invent a new name for something that is just the next step in genetic engineering, but the differences in approach are quite large and a new name signifies it.</p>

<p>With regards to synthesised vs. PCRed DNA: It doesn't really matter which you use in synthetic biology. However, cheap synthesis is one of the technologies that enable easier synthetic biology. The idea for the future is that you will be able to synthesise whole plasmids and chromosomes instead of having to ""cut and paste"" DNA. When that happens physical parts repositories will be obsolete, but they will remain crucial <em>in silico</em>. Cheap synthesis is nice, but doesn't make or brake synthetic biology.</p>

<p>Of all twin births, 30% are identical and 70% are non-identical (fraternal) twins.</p>

<p>Identical twins result when a zygote (one egg, or ovum, fertilized by one sperm) splits at an early stage to become twins. Because the genetic material is essentially the same, they resemble each other closely.</p>

<p>Typically during ovulation only one ovum is released to be fertilized by one sperm. However, sometimes a woman's ovaries release two ova. Each must be fertilized by a separate sperm cell.

Could anyone provide a slightly more expanded explanation, without going into too much detail, and without the use of too much jargon (I am not a biologist). I have read the wikipedia page, but sadly I didn't understand it....Thanks !</p>

<p>Edit: One of the things that is confusing me is what ""fat uptake"" means in this context.</p>
","<p>Fat uptake means cells eating fat.</p>

<p>I'll try to keep it simple, so forget the many approximations. You need first to consider that most fat circulates in the blood under the form of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"" rel=""noreferrer"">triglycerides (TG)</a>. TG are not soluble in water, so how do they circulate? They are hidden inside cargo vehicles called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"" rel=""noreferrer"">lipoproteins</a>. When a circulating lipoprotein touches a cell, if the cell expresses lipoprotein lipase (LPL), first LPL would trap the lipoprotein cargo, and then will start to catabolize the TG.</p>

<p>Importantly, there are no efficient TG cargoes inside the cell, so <strong>the function of lipoprotein lipase</strong> is to make fat easy to move inside the cell. TG are a chemical assembly of one glycerol and three fatty acids. Of note, there are good fatty acid cargoes inside the cell, so LPL will break TG into glycerol and fatty acids so that <a href=""http://www.wiley.com/legacy/college/boyer/0470003790/animations/fatty_acid_metabolism/fatty_acid_metabolism.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">they can be further metabolized</a> depending on the cell type.</p>

<p>Heart and muscle cells will bring fatty acids to mitochondria where they will be oxidized to produce energy. With reference to your question, adipocyte cells will bring fatty acids to other cellular compartments where they will be converted back to triglycerides and stored as fat. That's why you read that LPL facilitates fat uptake and storage in adipose tissue.</p>

<p>This statement is primarily true only for blood clots within <em>blood vessels</em>, especially in the veins. When you are talking about bruising, you are talking about clots outside of the vasculature.</p>

<p>When a blood clot occurs in an artery, it can block that artery or break off, flow downstream, and block some smaller distal vessel. These events are most severe when they affect crucial organs like the brain and heart (""stroke"" or ""heart attack""), though of course any organ can be damaged in this way. However, blood clots in arteries can't ever directly affect a tissue that is not distal from where the clot starts, because they can never pass through capillaries or travel backward.</p>

<p>When a blood clot occurs in a vein and is dislodged, it can follow the increasingly larger venous system back to the heart, where it can cause a pulmonary embolism (blockage in the lungs) or, via a patent foramen ovale, travel to the left-side circulation and end up anywhere, including the coronary arteries or blood vessels of the brain. Similarly, clots that form in the venous return from the lungs to the heart or in the left side of the heart itself can travel anywhere (except the lungs) and create a blockage.</p>

<p>For a clot outside the vasculature, for it to have an effect somewhere else systemically it must re-enter the vasculature. This is simply not possible in most situations, because the vessels involved are very small, and during bleeding the blood is flowing <em>out</em> of vessels: there is no pressure gradient to push the clot back into the vessels.</p>

<p>In more severe cases of injury where major vessels are involved, clotting in those major vessels can indeed be a problem, but not for common occurrences of bruising.</p>

","<p>The genome (entire DNA sequence) of the butterfly would be identical to that of the caterpillar in all somatic cells.  A caterpillar has the genes to produce wings, for example, however at that stage in it's development they are not 'switched on' to make the necessary proteins.  </p>

<p>If you were to sample the mRNA produced from transcription of the DNA in the caterpillar and butterfly stages, there are likely to be many differences.

"Is the swimming pool water harmful to frogs who jump in? If so, how?","8859","","<p>Here is an odd question:</p>

<p>Frogs have permeable skin. Indeed, via capillary action, frogs absorb water through their skin. </p>

<p>Chlorine is in principle a harmful substance. I am sure what percentage of chlorine is in swimming pools usually, but the pH level is kept to around 7.4. This is the desired pH level, as a pH of 7.4 is the pH-level in human eyes and mucous membranes.</p>

<p>One of the ""common wisdoms"" I had growing up was that if a leopard frog (i.e. The Northern Leopard Frog, rana pipiens) jumps into a swimming pool, it must die soon, because the chlorine would kill it. However, I now doubt this is true. </p>

<p>So, do frogs die from swimming pool water? If so, why? What exactly is killing them? Chlorine poisoning? </p>

<p>PS: I am having difficulty finding the correct tags for this question. Any help is appreciated. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Free chlorine (Cl2) is a greenish gas that is well known for its
  highly toxic properties as can be attested to by the thousands of
  soldiers that died and were severely injured from chlorine exposure
  during World War I. In water, chlorine is the most toxic substance
  that we will discuss. Ironically for the amphibian keeper, it is this
  toxic nature of chlorine and its ability to denature proteins, which
  makes its encounter inevitable. Chlorine is generally used as an
  antibacterial agent in municipal water supplies and may be present in
  concentrations of over 9 mg/1 in some tap water (measured in Houston,
  Texas as an example, although levels were generally lower). The
  concentration of chlorine in municipal water supplies can vary greatly
  from day to day, or even hour to hour, depending on conditions at the
  water treatment facilities. Concentrations as low as 0.0034 mg/1 have
  been noted to reduce reproduction in fathead minnows with 72 hour
  LC100 (lethal concentration for 100% kill) at 0.15 mg/1 (Arthur and
  Eaton,1971). LC50 (96 hour) for the shiners (Notemigonus chrysoleucas)
  was as low as 0.19 mg/1 (Esvelt et al., 1971). The concentrations
  found in municipal water supplies are many times greater than the
  minimum lethal concentrations for many aquatic life forms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the well being of the frog in the water of the swimming pool depends on the time the frog spends in the water. Eventually, with extended exposure the chlorine concentration will exceed the one compatible will life and the frog will die. This time is multifactorial variable, thus cannot be assessed easily - the weight and the skin surface area and skin permeability will affect the frog survival in a great degree. </p>

"Why is mRNA needed in the Protein translation?","8855","","<p>The original question was to predict the basic requirements for information storage. Then the discussion moved to why is it necessary to include mRNA in the protein translation process. Why can't there be a similar chemical molecule like tRNA which can directly read from DNA and exclude the mRNA intermediate. Also is the current translation process optimal in the sense that can there be a system which does not need mRNA or a similar intermediate altogether. Or is the presence of an intermediate a necessary requirement.</p>
","<p>One reason is that an intermediate like mRNA allows for higher amounts of protein expression. You can have multiple mRNA molecules that are translated simultaneously. If you read directly from DNA you can have at most two translations in parallel.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about this, but I would imagine that having to unwind the DNA double strand every time for translation could be a drawback to directly reading from DNA as well. The mRNA is also subject to various forms of regulation, which might be an advantage as well for the added intermediary.</p>

"Is it known how the first viruses formed?","8840","","<p><a href=""http://www.livescience.com/16015-oldest-viruses-insects.html"">The oldest known virus</a> is known to have infected prehistoric insects 300 million years ago. A virus is basically a parasitic strand if DNA or RNA encapsulated in a protein coat. It enters cells by ""wearing"" a protein coat made out of proteins needed by a certain cell (e.g. Lung cells and flu virus).</p>

<p>Now, my question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do we know how viruses naturally formed? To simplify the question, if we went back to the first virus, how would it form?</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I am looking for a scientific answer, and not wild-ass speculation. While I can accept some degree of speculation the accepted answer will <strong>NOT</strong> be based entirely on speculation if it is avoidable.</p>
","<p>One of the main points of contention in the study of virus evolution is whether or not they appear before the last universal cellular ancestor (LUCA) or afterwards (commonly accepted: genes that ""escaped"" from host organisms aka the escape hypothesis or vagrancy hypothesis).  Basically though, the LUCA is the most recent ancestor that all organisms living on Earth are derived from. </p>

<p>Increasing evidence support that ancestry of viruses may predate the LUCA, for example an idea is that there ""was an 'ancient virus world' of primordial replicators that existed before any cellular organisms and that both RNA (first) and DNA (later) viruses originated at this time, donating some features to the first cellular organisms.  However, ""a competing theory is that RNA cells existed before the LUCA and that RNA viruses were parasites on these RNA cells that later evolved DNA as a way of escaping host cell responses.""</p>

<p>So basically, some theories support the pre-LUCA ancient virus origin and some support post-LUCA.  Because it's impossible to replicate conditions from billions of years ago, several approaches using evolutionary genetics and probability models are recommended by the author of the paper, referenced below.  He also discusses the specific supporting criteria for the theories that you can read in greater detail.</p>

"How long do the periods of systole and diastole last?","8805","","<p>The background to this is i'm doing some work using ECGs for an animation of the heart and i'm having trouble defining the end points of these periods, particularly diastole. Currently, the only information the animation uses is the time (in seconds) when a R peak was detected in an ECG. </p>

<p>So i was wondering what the normal lengths of these periods are and what could affect the lengths of these periods.</p>

<p>I assume that the lengths of the periods is mainly affected by pressure/blood volume and not electrical activity so an ECG won't tell you how long these periods are (unless a heart beat is interrupted by another?). Is that assumption correct? </p>

How would i determine the length of these two periods in seconds and where could i find the ""normal"" lengths of these periods? in the cause of relaxation, i'm wondering about what to do when there is a substantial gap between heart beats.</p>
","<p>The following image from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_cycle#/media/File:Wiggers_Diagram.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a> answer what you need. You can check corresponding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_cycle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">page</a> for details.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SDdHw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The top part shows the details of the different processes during a heart beat. Corresponding to these events the ECG reads are marked. As you can see the distance between the T wave ( the small bump after the QRS complex) and the next P wave corresponds to the diastole. As you can see the pressure changes correlate well with the electric reads from the heart. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This</a> wiki page has great descriptions of the features of the ECG and the corresponding events.</p>

<p>For example P to QRS corresponds to the conduction of stimulus from the sine node to AV node, or QRS depicts the rapid depolarization and repoliarization of the ventricles. This latter leads to strong muscle contraction and this causes intaventicular pressure rise, that is followed by aortic pressure change.</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry, for missing the key point, I totally misunderstood what you needed. I'll try to correct my mistake (I'll leave the previous info as it may be useful for others) The authors of this paper did a really nice work on modeling and measuring left ventricle contraction time and other things.</p>

<p>The reference: (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1434992/pdf/biophysj00204-0121.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Beyar and Sidman 1984</a>)<br>
Long story short: the contraction of the ventricle depends on the initial amount of blood (preload), aortic blood pressure at the end (afterload), and intial contractility. The results are summarized in three tables:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yOMW9.png"" alt=""preload"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Le7kR.png"" alt=""afterload"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nxCNE.png"" alt=""contractility""></p>

<p>As you can see in the last columns, the ejection time varies with the parameters. The ejection time that is required for the ventricle to push the blood out to the aorta. Under normal circumstances a complete heart cycle is about 0.8s (or 800ms) this pie char shows the time ratio of main events. (Image taken from: <a href=""http://www.tutorvista.com/content/biology/biology-iv/circulation-animals/heart-cardiac-cycle.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorvista.com</a>)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SrPtw.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Note that complete cardiac diastole is when all the heart muscles are relaxed (this can be shortened if higher heart rate is required).</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isovolumic_relaxation_time"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) is an interval in the cardiac cycle, from the aortic component of the second heart sound, that is, closure of the aortic valve, to onset of filling by opening of the mitral valve. A normal IVRT is about 70 ± 12 ms, and approximately 10 ms longer in people over forty years. In abnormal relaxation, IVRT is usually in excess of 110 ms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isovolumic relaxation is when the muscle relaxes, yet the volume of the ventricle remains the same, thus only the internal pressure changes (it is analogue to isovolumic contraction - when the volume is unchanged, but pressure is built up, this happens at early ventricle contraction).</p>

"Separating DNA Fragments by Gel Electrophoresis. Are all the strands for one size the same?","8798","","<p>My apologies if my question is too basic, and please point me to a more appropriate forum.  I am reading the textbook ""Essential Cell Biology"" by Alberts et al, and am consulting other sources as well.  I am reading Chapter 10 about DNA technology and have read how DNA is separated into strands of different lengths by restriction enzymes.  The different size strands can then by separated by Gel Electrophoresis.  I believe I understand these basics. My question is:</p>

<p><strong>Do all strands of the same length have the same sequence of base pairs?  I wouldn't think      so, and this would be a problem in the next step, determining the sequence of one size fragment by  using special base pairs that are lacking a hydroxyl group. Isn't it possible I could have two strands that are 50 base pairs long (for example) that have the same beginning and same end and are thus cut by the restriction enzymes to a length of 50, but are most assuredly not the same within their sequence</strong></p>

<p>The text says that once the different size strands are separated by electrophoresis, you can just cut out one of the bands and work with that.  That makes sense if you are guaranteed to only have 1 strand at that level of the gel agar or if the multiple strands are all the same exact sequence.</p>

<p>If you read this far, thank you.  I think more generally I need to know how many of these segments are produced when you use restriction enzymes and how long the average one is. And is there any guarantee for one chromosone (or all 46 chrmosones) having all the segments be unique sizes (I wouldn't think so)?</p>

<p>And even more generally :), I need additional sources that explain DNA sequencing in simple to understand terms.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Dave</p>
","<p>You are correct: strands of the same length do <em>not</em> necessarily have the same sequence. The separation of DNA in gel electrophoresis is purely based on the hydrodynamic size. </p>

<p>The number of fragments produced by restriction enzyme digestion depends on the number of sites for that particular enzyme in your input DNA.  Restriction enzymes only cut at specific nucleotide sequences.  There is no ""typical length"" of fragment produced for this reason.</p>

<p>The idea of separating DNA on the basis of an RE digest is that a mutation that changes the sequence <em>where the RE binds and cuts</em> will reduce the number of fragments because the RE can no longer bind and cut at that site: 2 smaller fragments will now appear as one large fragment.  It will be visible on the gel because of the difference in number and size of fragments.</p>

<p>Typically, when running a gel, you are using DNA that has been selectively amplified to bias the readout to a particular (known) region of the chromosome. This electrophoretic approach works because you're not looking at all 46 chromosomes at once.</p>

<p>As far as sequencing is concerned, I'd recommend starting with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>.  Sequencing techniques are changing rather rapidly, so there's not one good source of which I am aware. To begin with, you can read about Sanger sequencing method.

","<p>The major effect of changing the redox environment of a protein is the formation or breakage of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide_bond"">disulfide bonds</a>. Under sufficiently reducing conditions no disulfide bridges will be present, while under oxidizing conditions your protein will form disulfide bridges if it has the ability to do so.</p>

<p>Disulfide bridges can significantly change the tertiary structure of a protein and change the behaviour of the protein on a gel that way. Generally, disulfide bridges should make the protein more compact and make it run faster on a gel.</p>

<p>It is therefore plausible that your faster band is the protein with disulfide bridges, which will appear to run like a smaller protein as it is more compact. The slower band then is the protein without disulfide bridges which can adopt a more extended conformation.</p>

<p>I'm assuming you're talking about native gels here, as denaturing gels usually contain DTT or beta-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer to reduce any disulfide bonds and avoid this effect altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why (and how) is regenerated skin different from original ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? Skin is a very important organ. It protects from pathogens, it maintains body temperature, it keeps body water [1], etc. How? That depends on what causes the regeneration. I've emphasized two terms in the above list.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Stratum corneum</em> represents the ""skin cells that becomes the dust in our homes and it always grows back to full thickness"". It is lost during a physiological process called desquamation [2]. The cells that are lost are non living corneocytes. Their only purpose is to from a protection barrier [3].</li>
<li><em>Basement membrane</em> holds the germinativum layer of the epidermis. Injuries that do not affect it are repaired by complete regeneration of all destroyed layers. However, if the injury destroys membrane continuity, the germinative cells on the edges will fail to ""reconnect"" with each other, thus the layers derived from them will follow the same rule. A process of fibrosis is triggered. The result of  extensive fibrosis is a scar, containing collagen secreted by the granulation tissue with dermal origins. Yet, the germinative layer tends to join back together [6], but probably the excess collagen production, without the limiting basement membrane, bulges into the epidermis and limits germinative layer extension. That's why keeping the edges of the tissue close to each other reduces excessive fibrosis and allows germinative layer regeneration, thus resulting in none to small, barely visible scars.</li>
</ul>

<p>How deep should an injury be in order not to affect basement membrane? No more than 0.06 to 0.08 mm [5].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What about skin transplants ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skin grafts contain at least a part of dermis [4], which will allow granulation tissue formation thus permitting revascularisation and making the graft stick. Otherwise it would fall off and/or be lost by necrosis.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourness#Sourness%20sour"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cerumen is produced in the outer third of the cartilaginous portion of

  glands and less-viscous ones from modified apocrine sweat glands.[4]
  The primary components of earwax are shed layers of skin, with 60% of

  long-chain fatty acids, alcohols, squalene and 6–9% cholesterol.[5]</p>

  <p>While studies conducted up until the 1960s found little evidence
  supporting antibacterial activity for cerumen,[15] more recent studies
  have found that cerumen has a bactericidal effect on some strains of

<p>1: Dehydration is the main reason why fast food fries/burgers do not decompose easily. Placing the burgers in a ziplock bag, preventing dehydration, causes the burgers to decompose.</p>

<p>2: Since an unsalted, home-made burger did not decompose, preservatives, chemicals, saturated fats, and other components are unlikely to be the case of the fast food burgers not rotting. </p>

"What is the explanation for the smaller number of tRNA than codons?","8655","","<blockquote>
  <p>Translation, or decoding, of the four-nucleotide language of DNA and
  mRNA into the 20–amino acid language of proteins requires tRNAs and
  enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. To participate in protein
  synthesis, a tRNA molecule must become chemically linked to a
  particular amino acid via a high-energy bond, forming an
  aminoacyl-tRNA; the anticodon in the tRNA then base-pairs with a codon
  in mRNA so that the activated amino acid can be added to the growing
  polypeptide chain.</p>
  
  <p>Some 30–40 different tRNAs have been identified in bacterial cells
  and as many as 50–100 in animal and plant cells. Thus the number of
  tRNAs in most cells is more than the number of amino acids used in
  protein synthesis (20) and also differs from the number of amino acid
  codons in the genetic code (61). Consequently, many amino acids have
  more than one tRNA to which they can attach ; in addition, many tRNAs
  can pair with more than one codon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If perfect Watson-Crick base pairing were demanded between codons and anticodons, cells would have to contain exactly 61 different tRNA species, one for each codon that specifies an amino acid. As noted above, however, many cells contain fewer than 61 tRNAs. </p>

"Why do plants fruit?","8635","","<p>This is a two-part question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the point of fruit if not to be eaten? It’s my understanding that organisms will adapt to survive and thrive. I understand that being eaten can spread seeds, but this just seems like too much of a risky tactic to rely on.</p></li>
<li><p>Following on from part one: If being eaten is the best way to spread seed, why do some plants avoid this (such as by being poisonous or thorny)?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p><strong>Seeds are spread by many mechanisms</strong> </p>

<p>Wind dispersal: When air currents used to spread seeds. Often these plants have evolved features to facilitate wind catching, for example <a href=""https://www.google.se/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=dandelion%20seeds"">dandelions</a>. Aka, <a href=""http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anemochory"">anemochory</a>. </p>

<p>Propulsion &amp; bursting: When seeds are propelled from the plant in an such as in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iyKAq_s7-M"">these videos</a>. This is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_dispersal#Autochory"">Ballochory</a>.</p>

<p>Water: Similarly to wind dispersal plants can spread seeds by water movement/currents, aka <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hydrochory"">Hydrochory</a>. This is used by many algae and water living plants.</p>

<p>Sticky Seeds: There are many ways a seed can attach to the outside of an animal - by using hooks, barbs, sticky excretions, hairs. Seeds then get carried by an animal and fall off later. This is <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epizoochory"">epizoochory</a>.</p>

<p>Fruiting: Plants can use seed-bearing fruit to encourage animals to eat the seeds. They will then be spread when the waste is excreted after digestion. This is a process of <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/endozoochory"">endozoochory</a>. </p>

<p><strong>More than one way to spread a seed</strong></p>

<p>From above you can see there are many ways to spread a seed. This means that many plants (those that do not use fruit) will want (from an evolutionary perspective) to avoid being eaten at all costs, and therefore evolve poison/taste cues that reduce the frequency of this. However, if investing in producing fruit bears a net benefit, ie many seeds are spread and successfully propagate, then the cost of fruit production is not a risk. A fruiting plant can minimize the risk by limiting reward (making fruit taste good and be nutritious) to only the right spatiotemporal moment when the seeds are primed for dispersal, if the fruit is eaten before the seeds are ready/present in the fruit then there will be no benefit of producing the fruit. (I expect this is why unripe fruit doesn't tend to taste so nice - it doesn't taste nice unless it's ripe because those where mutations made fruit taste good before the seeds were ready had no offspring, and those that time the ripening well were much more successful).</p>

<p>Producing an edible fruit is not necessarily the <em>best</em> way but is the way many plant species have evolved to spread their seeds. Evolution works by random mutation and selection, which can only work with the variation it has available - only if a mutation to produce fruit arises in a species and it improves fitness is it then likely to spread. <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.00271.x/abstract"">It appears that endozoochory could be a very good methods of long distance dispersal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Some interesting stuff</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly, <a href=""http://awesci.com/cranberry-migration/"">according to this blog post</a>, unripe fruits taste bitter because they are full of tanins. Cranberries are an odd fruit because they taste bitter which means they are unattractive to animals, but they do float - which is a good dispersal method - because of an air-pocket inside the fruit that evolved. It could be the case then that once a mutation arrived for the air-pocket the fruit could just float away on water to a new location, and then using resources to make the fruit sweet and tasty became an unnecessary cost so was lost (to some degree).</p>

<p><a href=""http://phys.org/news/2010-11-benefits-bitter-cranberry-evolution-thanksgiving.html"">This article</a> contains this text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like many species of plants native to North America, the cranberry is specially adapted to wetlands -- water-soaked areas that create transition points between dry land and open water. But cranberries do not grow directly in the water. Instead, they typically lay their roots at its edge, taking advantage of the rich soils created by alternating layers of peat, sand, clay and rock.
  Other fruits are dependent on hungry creatures to spread their seed,
  so sweetness can help their chance of being eaten and transported
  elsewhere. Not cranberries. Because of their little air pockets, the
  fruit falls from the plant's long vines when ripe and lets the water
  transport it to distant beds.</p>
  
  <p>This advantage dictated the fruit we eat today.</p>
  
  <p>Blueberries and cranberries are close cousins and are in fact not
  berries at all; they belong instead to a class of fruits known as
  epigynous or false berries. Unlike a true berry, the fruit grows from
  beneath the rest of the flower parts and as the fruit ripens the
  flower stays attached and ripens as well.</p>
  
  <p>Vorsa believes that at some point during the last ice age there were
  fewer animals to eat the fruits, and this might have driven the two
  species to diverge. The cranberries developed an acidity level five
  times higher than blueberries because it came to rely on water for
  seed dispersal. Cranberries did not need to produce large amounts of
  sugar that their blue-colored relatives required to entice consumption
  by animals in order to spread their seeds.</p>

"How did the first self replicating organism come into existence?","8621","","<p>When people try to explain evolution, they tell me that evolution is a cumulative result of mutations &amp; natural section of the more superior individuals of a particular species.

<p>What you're asking about is not a theory of ""evolution"" but rather a theory of ""abiogenesis.""  Although there are many interesting hypothesis for how abiogenesis happened (e.g. the RNA world, the ""metabolism first"" theory, etc.), the fact is we simply do not know yet how life first arose.  What we do know is that life first arose between 3.5 and 3.9 billion years ago.

It seems I had fallen for a common misconception, that evolution was about <em>improvement by increasing complexity</em>. One comment discussing that post read</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""... he [David Deutsch] is falling for one of the biggest
  misconceptions about evolution that you can, that evolution is about
  <em>improvement</em>. Evolution has simply only ever been about change..."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, when you look at the history of life you see increases in complexity. You see this increasing complexity evolving over billions of years, suggesting that it requires an explanation.</p>

<p><strong>My question</strong><br>
If evolution is not about increasing complexity then how does so much complexity evolve?</p>
","<p>I think possibly the problem here is the way you're approaching the issue.</p>

<p>You're considering <em>improvement</em> as anything that increases the abilities or complexity of the organism—that isn't necessarily what an <em>improvement</em> is though. The outcome of natural selection is that the organism best equipped to survive/reproduce in a certain environment is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection#Mechanism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">most successful</a>. So, for example, thermophillic archaea do much better in 60°C-plus pools of water than humans do. Our capacity to process information, use tools, etc. doesn't actually confer much advantage in that situation. And there can be downsides to that kind of complexity as well, <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7318/full/nature09486.html?foxtrotcallback=true"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">requiring more energy</a> and <a href=""https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XDoZSBPj_tQC&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;ots=GLltT9R3UX&amp;dq=complex%20organism%20gestation%20time&amp;pg=PT18#v=onepage&amp;q=complex%20organism%20gestation%20time&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">longer developmental periods</a>. So, natural selection in 60°C-plus pools of water gives you archaea, and in (presumably) the plains of East Africa, it gives you humans.</p>

<p>The comment you quote mentions sickle-cell anaemia, which is a different example. While there is little benefit to having the sickle-cell anaemia allele in a temperate region, in those regions where malaria is endemic, heterozygosity can provide a survival advantage, and so the allele is maintained in the population. If you're someone living in a malaria-endemic region, and you don't have access to antimalarials, heterozygosity for the sickle-cell anaemia allele is arguably an <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/sickle_cell.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>improvement</em></a>. It depends entirely on how you define the word.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution#Natural_selection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fundamental principal</a> of natural selection is that it favours the organism most suited to a particular environment. But, that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_biological_complexity#Selection_for_simplicity_and_complexity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">isn't always</a> the <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13617-evolution-myths-natural-selection-leads-to-ever-greater-complexity/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">most complex</a> organism. It's important not to confuse <em>human-like</em> with <em>better</em>. It isn't the universal endpoint of evolution to produce an organism similar to us, just the organism most suited to the environment in question.</p>

<p>Also, to briefly address the previous question you asked—you asserted that we must be missing something from the process of evolution because we were unable to simulate it. You also pointed out that (in your opinion) we have sufficient computing power to simulate the kinds of organisms you're referring to. But natural selection is intrinsically linked to the environment it occurs in, so the simulation wouldn't just have to accurately simulate the biological processes of the organism, but also <strong>all</strong> of the external pressures the organism faces. I'd imagine that, in simulating evolution, <em>that</em> would be the real obstacle.</p>

<p>Is this due to the different pH (MES is usually run at pH 8.0, MOPS is usually run at pH 7.0) or is the charge distribution on the counter-ion responsible for everything?</p>
","<p>Well, to rationalize everyone's comments, I think @leonardo is right.  </p>

<p>This is a denaturing SDA PAGE gel.  The migration of the SDS Micelles which are negatively charged, depends upon the shielding of the solution around it.  The difference in mobility is because the SDS micelles will experience a slightly different field at pH ~6.2 (MES) vs 7.2 (MOPS).  </p>

<p>The thought that these have the same charge would be right at exactly the pH corresponding to the pKa.  For these two ions the proportions will not be the same when running 0.8 pH units from their respective pKas. the ion concentration goes as +/- log ([BH]/[B-]) and the charge environment of the buffer should not be the same.  I think that the higher pH for MOPS running will tend to create more negative charge in the solution from MOPS- but also OH- in solution, slowing the mobility of the micelles and favoring the resolution of the larger proteins with MOPS. </p>

We've found three relevant papers:</p>

</ol>

<p>which has given us what we think is a good high-end guess of 40µl of oxygen per minute consumed. </p>

<p>However, we don't know at what point the oxygen level would get too low for the bee, or if carbon dioxide poisoning  would occur. Does anyone have a source for the minimum oxygen levels a bee needs to survive, or the point at which CO₂ toxicity becomes a problem?</p>
","<p>Assuming the jar is airtight--</p>

<p>I think your oxygen consumption rate may be too high and that 40$\mu l$ per hour$^1$ might be closer but since it's a high figure anyway we can use it. 40 $\mu l$ per minute would be about 2400 $\mu l $/hr. </p>

<p>A 12-ounce jar is about 0.355 liters. At sea level, air contains about 20% oxygen so the volume of oxygen in the jar is about 0.0709 liters.</p>

<p>At altitudes which are considered high for humans (17000 feet or higher) the percentage of oxygen falls to about 15%. If a bee is able to get 2400 $ \mu l$ of oxygen per hour from a jar, the volume of oxygen will fall to about 13% after ten hours.$^2$   </p>

<p>Based on oxygen consumption alone I think a bee would be stressed at this level, especially at temperatures exceeding 32C. I would guess the bee would be stressed well before this, maybe after 5 hours (16.6% oxygen). If we factor in the likelihood that the bee's respiration is up due to the agitation of confinement I think we can shave another hour off. </p>

<p>Depending on the age, size, species, variety, temperature, location, etc. I think an outside limit of 4 hours in an airtight jar is a good guess. </p>

<p>Toxicity from CO$_2$ may be a problem but bees have a much higher tolerance for CO$_2$ than humans, according to one set of <a href=""https://insects.tamu.edu/continuing_ed/bee_biology/lectures/password/Internal_Anatomy_of_Honey_Bees_PN.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">entomology notes</a>. At 0.04% the concentration will only increase marginally due to a drop in oxygen alone but the bee itself will produce CO$_2$ and in far greater quantities under stress. A chart <a href=""http://www.coloss.org/beebook/I/physiology/6/1/3"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> shows production of CO$_2$ in reaction to a light being turned on. 400 ppm is 0.04% but in this case it is due to the bee. If the bee during respiration returns CO$_2$ as quickly as it consumes oxygen the jar could reach 7% CO$_2$ in four hours, a level that may be toxic for humans. But we have already suggested the bee is under stress from oxygen depletion at that point. </p>

<p>There are many assumptions in this note. A conservative estimate might be an hour in an airtight jar. I would not bet on more. There are probably other issues I haven't thought of. Bees are very fragile and the chart linked above suggests they would not fare will in such an environment.  </p>

<p>$^1$ Respiration of Worker Honeybees of Different Ages and at Different Temperatures, Allen, 1958, J. Experimental Biology 36, 92-101. At page 97 Allen gives a chart showing log $\mu l$ $O_2$/mg body weight/hr. For a 14-23 day old bee at 32C he appears to give about .5 which means 1.65/mg/hr or about 115 $\mu l$ per hour for a 70mg bee. It may be a typo or perhaps I am misreading the chart. Also the study uses an older method of measuring respiration.</p>

<p>$^2$ This is a simplification. The bee will start breathing a mixture containing falling oxygen levels and this may slow the oxygen depletion a little. But if we say the bee needs what it needs this saves us a differential equation. </p>

<p>Also, related, how does eye colour change, particularly in childhood?  (example:  my eyes used to be blue, but are now greenish-hazel).</p>
","<p>The colour of human eyes is determined by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>pigmentation</strong> present and the <strong>scattering of light</strong>.</a> Variance in the colour and density of the pigments affects how light is absorbed and reflected causing the different iris colours we see. Wiki has a fairly comprehensive coverage on the topic so,I'll use a few of the wikipedia examples to explain how the pigmentation and scattering of light interact to give colours:</p>

<p><strong>Blue eye colour</strong> is the result of pigment in low concentration and Rayleigh scattering (or Tyndall effect) of the short <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EM_spectrum.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">light wavelengths (blue is short, red is long)</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There is no blue pigmentation either in the iris or in the ocular
  fluid. Dissection reveals that the iris pigment epithelium is brownish
  black due to the presence of melanin. Unlike brown eyes, blue eyes
  have low concentrations of melanin in the stroma of the iris, which
  lies in front of the dark epithelium. Longer wavelengths of light tend
  to be absorbed by the dark underlying epithelium, while shorter
  wavelengths are reflected and undergo Rayleigh scattering in the
  turbid medium of the stroma. This is the same frequency-dependence
  of scattering that accounts for the blue appearance of the sky.
  The result is a ""Tyndall blue"" structural color that varies with
  external lighting conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Brown eyes</strong> are the result of higher melanin concentrations which absorbs more of the light, reducing the amount of light being reflected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""In humans, brown eyes result from a relatively high concentration of
  melanin in the stroma of the iris, which causes light of both shorter
  and longer wavelengths to be absorbed.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Green eyes</strong> appear to be mid-ground between blue and brown, they have more pigment than blue but less than brown.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""As in the case of blue eyes, the color of green eyes does not result
  simply from the pigmentation of the iris. Rather, its appearance is
  caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of
  the stroma, given by a low or moderate concentration of melanin, with
  the blue tone imparted by the Rayleigh scattering of the reflected
  light.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More can be read on this in these two studies: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9778410"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">study 1</a> &amp; <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0749.2005.00268.x/full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">study 2</a></p>

<p><strong>What is Rayleigh scattering / the Tyndall effect and why do they turn eyes blue?</strong></p>

<p>I shall refer to this as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyndall_effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tyndall effect</a> but in the literature both Rayleigh and Tyndall are used because they are apparently very similar though Tyndall occurs with much larger particles. The Tyndall effect is caused by the variable scattering of light by particles depending on the wavelength of the light and relative size of the particles. Shorter wavelength lights are scattered more than the longer ones (so more red light is absorb than blue) which means more blue light is reflected. When more melanin is present in the iris it will better absorb the short wavelength light than when there is little melanin, therefore, people with low melanin levels appear to have blue eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""An analogy to this wavelength dependency is that longwave electromagnetic waves such as radio waves are able to pass through the walls of buildings, while shortwave electromagnetic waves such as light waves are stopped and reflected by the walls.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why do eye colours change?</strong></p>

<p>Again, wikipedia has a fairly thorough section on this and I will just summarise and directly quote it. Eye colour can change because the melanocytes responsible for the pigments have to continually produce pigment and, just like those causing colour in hair, they can become less productive (<a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2756/why-does-hair-turn-grey-or-white-and-why-does-it-happen-later-for-some"">which is why we have grey hair</a>) and this happens more with age. Infants often have blue eyes that turn dark, just like yours did, because the melanin is gradually accumulated - it just takes time for enough pigment to build up and allow the eye colour to match it's genetic determinants:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Most babies who have European ancestry have light-colored eyes before the age of one. As the child develops, melanocytes (cells found within the iris of human eyes, as well as skin and hair follicles) slowly begin to produce melanin. Because melanocyte cells continually produce pigment, in theory eye color can be changed. Most eye changes happen when the infant is around one year old, although it can happen up to three years of age. Observing the iris of an infant from the side using only transmitted light with no reflection from the back of the iris, it is possible to detect the presence or absence of low levels of melanin. An iris that appears blue under this method of observation is more likely to remain blue as the infant ages. An iris that appears golden contains some melanin even at this early age and is likely to turn green or brown as the infant ages.
  Changes (lightening or darkening) of eye colors during puberty, early childhood, pregnancy, and sometimes after serious trauma (like heterochromia) do represent cause for plausible argument to state that some eyes can or do change, based on chemical reactions and hormonal changes within the body.
  ... eye color over time can be subject to change, and major demelanization of the iris may also be genetically determined.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=642125"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In this study</a> 10-15% of those studied had changes in eye colour beyond childhood so, al though colour is generally stable past childhood, it is not uncommon for eyes to change, and this is likely due to changes in melanin composition. <a href=""http://www.usask.ca/biology/bortolotti/pubs/pbz-76-99-104.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This study</a> is an example of clour change in birds too.</p>

<p><strong>A side note: Animals with other colours</strong></p>

<p>It is common for animals to have other eye colours, for example Blackbirds (<em>Turdus merula</em>) have an Orange eye, which is caused by Carotenoid pigments, rather than melanin as in humans. The reason they have this could be as an indicator of quality in courtship - carotenoids are hard to get, males with bright orange eyes therefore have access to good food resources, and female blackbirds find that attractive.

"Are there any non-mammalian species known that lactate?","8575","","<p>Are there any non-mammalian animals that produce milk to feed their young, or are mammals the only milk-producing animals?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Technically, only mammals lactate. To <em><a href=""http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lactate"" rel=""noreferrer"">lactate</a></em> means <em>to produce milk from the mammaries to feed a baby or young animal</em>. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Milk</em></a>, in turn, is defined as the secretions from mammary glands. However, there are animals other than mammals that produce milk-<em>like</em> substances to feed their young.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Both male and female <strong>pigeons</strong> (<em>Columba livia</em>) possess the ability to produce a nutrient substance, termed pigeon ‘milk’, to feed their young. A similar substance is produced by <strong>flamingos</strong> and male <strong>emperor penguins</strong>. The normal function of a crop is a food storage area located between the oesophagus and proventriculus where food is moistened before further break-down and digestion through the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 1).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3et5W.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3et5W.jpg"" alt=""pigeon""></a> <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aA7Vd.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aA7Vd.jpg"" alt=""dove""></a><br>
<sup>Fig. 1. Schematic of the location of the 'milk'-producing crop in a pigeon (left) and a pigeon feeding its chick from its crop (right).

<p>During the process of pigeon ‘lactation’, a curd-like substance is regurgitated from the crop to the chick. The dry-substance of pigeon ‘milk’ is 60% protein, 32-36% fat, 1-3% carbohydrate and some minerals, including calcium. It has been shown that pigeon ‘milk’ contains IgA antibodies, which provides evidence suggestive that it is more than a nutrients alone. The physiological mechanisms governing pigeon ‘milk’ production and delivery are unknown. It is well documented that the pigeon crop is responsive to the lactogenic hormone prolactin. However, the <em>pigeon crop tissue during ‘lactation’ is <strong>structurally unrelated to the mammary glands</strong> in mammalians, because it is not glandular and secretory processes do not seem to be involved</em> <a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2164-12-452.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Gillespie <em>et al</em>, 2011)</a>. </p>

<p>The similarity between this process and lactation in mammals is striking, but is a case of convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently evolve similar traits. 'Milk' production is also recorded in some <strong>fishes</strong>, where it is fed to their young in the form of a mucous secretion on the skin <a href=""http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3787"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Buckley, 2010)</a>. Certain <strong>amphibians</strong> shed skin cells that are fed to the young. But the 'milk' of pigeons and doves is thought to be the most highly specialized of any non-mammalian 'milk' (<a href=""http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2011/09/mysteries-of-pigeon-milk-explained/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Australian Geographic, September 2011</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Vascular cambium</strong></p>

<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_cambium"" rel=""nofollow"">wiki</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The vascular cambium (plural cambia) is a plant tissue located between the xylem and the phloem in the stem and root of a vascular plant, and is the source of both the secondary xylem growth (inwards, towards the pith <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_cambium"" rel=""nofollow"">material at the center of plant, often dead and/or deteriorated, that is composed of parenchyma tissue</a>) and the secondary phloem growth (outwards [to the bark, rough or smooth, of the plant]). It is a cylinder of unspecialized meristem cells that divide to give new cells which then specialize to form secondary vascular tissues.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.biology.lifeeasy.org/5040/what-is-intrafascicular-cambium"" rel=""nofollow"">Biology.easlife</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cambial strip which is present between the primary xylem and primary phloem is known as the intra fascicular cambium. The intra fascicular cambium is also known as the vascular cambium. During the secondary growth the cambial ring is formed by the inter connection of the intra fascicular and inter fascicular cambium. - See more at: <a href=""http://www.biology.lifeeasy.org/5040/what-is-intrafascicular-cambium#sthash.aY3SPblI.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biology.lifeeasy.org/5040/what-is-intrafascicular-cambium#sthash.aY3SPblI.dpuf</a></p>

"Are there any motile plants?","8473","","<p>There are numerous examples of sessile animals (sponges, barnacles etc.) but are there any examples of motile plants? If not, why not? Surely mobility would have conferred an evolutionary advantage to some plant species. I am specifically thinking of locomotion here.</p>
","<p>It depends how you define <strong>locomotion</strong>.</p>

<p>If you take it to mean <strong>moving from one place to another</strong>, then yes, almost all plants do this at some stage during their life cycle. Primarily seeds and pollen move around, and generally they do so by harnessing either natural forces like wind and rain, or by manipulating animals to do the leg-work, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>by recruiting pollinating insects</li>
<li>by having barbs which snag the fur of passing mammals</li>
<li>by producing tasty fruit so monkeys eat them, seeds included, and deposit them with a dollop of fertiliser somewhere else</li>
</ul>

<p>If you take it to mean <strong>moving around under ones own propulsion</strong>, then yes, some plants do this. The example that springs to mind is the gametophyte generation of ferns:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F4sq5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The prothallus (i.e. the gametophyte) has rhizoids on the underside and uses them to slide around and find some space in which to start the next generation. I have seen this happen when fern spores are germinated on agar - when they reach the tiny prothallus stage, they start sliding around to avoid overlapping with one another. I can't find any references for this, but I'll keep looking.</p>

<p>Another example of self-directed locomotion in plants is the motile sperm of bryophytes. The male sex cells have flagella, which they use to propel themselves through water to the female sex cells (reviewed by <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20013591099209"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Renzaglia &amp; Garbary 2001</a>).</p>

"Why does evolution not make our life longer?","8462","","<p>Why does evolution not make life longer for humans or any other species?</p>

<p>Wouldn't evolution favour a long life?</p>
","<p>Why do we age is a classical question in Evolutionary Biology. There are several things to consider when we think of how genes that cause disease, aging, and death to evolve.</p>

<p>One explanation for the evolution of aging is the <a href=""http://www.programmed-aging.org/theories/mutation_accumulation.html""><strong>mutation accumulation</strong> (<strong>MA</strong>)</a> hypothesis. This hypothesis by P. Medawar states that mutations causing late life deleterious (damaging) effects can build up in the genome more than diseases that cause early life disease. This is because selection on late acting mutations is weaker. Mutations that cause early life disease will more severely reduce the fitness of its carrier than late acting mutations. For example, if we said in an imaginary species that all individuals cease to reproduce at 40 years old and a mutation arises that causes a fatal disease at 50 years old then selection can not remove it from the population - carriers will have as many children as those who do not have the gene. Under the mutation accumulation hypothesis it is then possible for mutations to <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIDGeneticdrift.shtml"">drift</a> through the population.</p>

<p>Another hypothesis which could contribute to aging is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonistic_pleiotropy_hypothesis""><strong>antagonistic pleiotropy</strong> (<strong>AP</strong>)</a> hypothesis of G.C. Williams. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"">Pleiotropy</a> is when genes have more than one effect, such genes tend to cause correlations between traits, height and arm length probably have many of the same genes affecting them, otherwise there would be no <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8793422"">correlation between arm length and height</a> (though environment and linkage can also cause these patterns)... Back to AP as an explanation for aging, if a gene improves fitness early in life, but causes late life disease it can spread through the population via selection. The favourable early effect spreads well because of selection and, just as with MA, selection can not ""see"" the late acting disease.</p>

<p>Under both MA and AP the key point is that selection is less efficient at removing late acting deleterious mutations, and they may spread more rapidly thanks to beneficial early life effects. Also if there is extrinsic mortality (predation etc.) then the effect of selection is also weakened on alleles that affect late life. The same late-life reduction in the efficacy of selection also slows the rate at which alleles increasing lifespan spread.</p>

<p>A third consideration is the <a href=""http://www.programmed-aging.org/theories/disposable_soma.html""><strong>disposable-soma model</strong></a>, a description by T. Kirkwood of life-history trade-offs which might explain why aging and earlier death could be favoured. The idea is that individuals have a limited amount of resources available to them - perhaps because of environmental constraints or ability to acquire/allocate the resources. If we then assume that individuals have to use their energy for two things, staying alive via repair and maintenance (somatic-maintenance) and making offspring (reproductive-investment), then any energy devoted to one will take away from the other. If an individual carries a gene that makes it devote all of its energy to somatic maintenance then its fitness will be very low (probably 0!) and that gene will not spread. If the level of maintenance required to live forever costs more energy than an individual can spare without suffering from low fitness (very likely) or can even acquire and efficiently convert in the first place (also very likely) then high-maintenance alleles will not spread (and aging &amp; death will continue to occur). </p>

<p>To go a little further, it is common for sexes to age differently (this is what I work on) and one possible explanation is that the sexes favour different balances of the trade off between somatic-maintenance and reproductive investment, this can lead to conflict over the evolution of genes affecting this balance and slow the rates of evolution to sex specific optima. <a href=""http://www.cosmoid.de/zajitschek/papers/Bonduriansky2008FunctionalEcology.pdf"">This paper</a> provides a good review of the area.</p>

<p><strong>To summarise</strong>, evolution has not managed to get rid of death via genetic disease etc. (intrinsic mortality) because the effect is only weakly selected against, and those alleles may provide some early life benefit, and resource limitation may also reduce the potential to increase lifespan due to trade-offs with reproductive effort. Adaptive evolution is not about the <em>survival</em> of the fittest but the <em>reproduction</em> of the fittest - the fittest allele is the one which spreads the most effectively.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks to Remi.b for also pointing out some other considerations. </p>

<p>Another thought is that of altruistic aging - aging for the good of the population (the population is likely to contain related individuals, <em>you</em> are related to all other humans to some degree). In this model aging is an adaptive process (unlike in MA where it is just a consequence of weak selection). By dying an individual makes space for it's offspring/relatives to survive (because resources are then less likely to limit populations). This will stop excessive population growth which could lead to crashes in the population and so, by dying earlier, an individual promotes the likelihood that its progeny will survive. Arguments of altruistic sacrifice are often hard to promote but <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/255170953_Viscous_populations_evolve_altruistic_programmed_aging_in_ability_conflict_in_a_changing_environment"">recent work suggests that this is a more plausible model than once thought</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.programmed-aging.org/theories/evolvability_theories.html"">Evolvabilty theories</a> also suggest that aging is an adaptive process. These suggest that populations, composed of a mixture of young and old, have biases in how well adapted the members of the population are - where younger individuals are better adapted (because they were produced more recently it is likely that the environment is similar to the environment they are favoured in). Thus by removing the less well adapted individuals from a population via senescence and freeing up resources for younger better adapted individuals, a population evolves more rapidly towards it optimal state.</p>

","<p>Because cells are not only characterized by by their genetic material and other interior components, but also by the genes they express. Cells have to fulfill multiple different functions to be able to build complex multicellular organisms. Differently expressed genes lead to different proteins made in the cell, which leads to different morphology, shape or function. For example melanocytes in the skin are highly specialized cells which mostly make the pigment melanin. Plasma cells on the other are highly specialised for making antibodies.</p>

<p>It is all about regulation of genes. The RNA doesn't know or transcribe anything - 
the DNA is trancribed into the mRNA (which is then further processed) and finally translated into proteins. Cells develop from precursors which proliferate and finally differentiate into highly specific cells. This progress is controlled and activated by specific transcription factors and growth factors. For example: pigment cells only develop, when a specific transcription factor is present. When this factor cannot be expressed, these cells do not develop at all.</p>

","<p>Great question, and one about which there has historically been a lot of speculation, and there is currently a lot of misinformation. I will first address the two answers given by other users, which are both incorrect but have been historically suggested by scientists. Then I will try to explain the current understanding (which is not simple or complete). My answer is derived directly from the literature, and in particular from Mable (2004), which in turn is part of the <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bij.2004.82.issue-4/issuetoc"">2004 special issue of the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society</a> tackling the subject.</p>

<p><strong>The 'sex' answer...</strong></p>

<p>In 1925 HJ Muller addressed this question in a famous paper, ""Why polyploidy is rarer in animals than in plants"" (Muller, 1925). Muller briefly described the phenomenon that polyploidy was frequently observed in plants, but rarely in animals. The explanation, he said, was simple (and is approximate to that described in Matthew Piziak's answer):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>animals usually have two sexes which are differentiated by means of a process involving the diploid mechanism of segregation and combination whereas plants-at least the higher plants-are usually hermaphroditic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Muller then elaborated with three explanations of the mechanism:</p>

<ol>
<li>He assumed that triploidy was usually the intermediate step in chromosome duplication. This would cause problems, because if most animals' sex was determined by the ratios of chromosomes (as in Drosophila), triploidy would lead to sterility. </li>
<li>In the rare cases when a tetraploid was accidentally created, it would have to breed with diploids, and this would result in a (presumably sterile) triploid.</li>
<li>If, by chance, two tetraploids were to arise and mate, they would be at a disadvantage because, he said, they would be randomly allocated sex chromosomes and this would lead to a higher proportion of non-viable offspring, and thus the polyploid line would be outcompeted by the diploid.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, whilst the first two points are valid facts about polyploids, the third point is incorrect. A major flaw with Muller's explanation is that it only applies to animals with chromosomal ratio-based sex determination, which we have since discovered is actually relatively few animals. In 1925 there was comparatively little systematic study of life, so we really didn't know what proportion of plant or animal taxa showed polyploidy. Muller's answer doesn't explain why most animals, e.g. those with Y-dominant sex determination, exhibit relatively little polyploidy. Another line of evidence disproving Muller's answer is that, in fact, polyploidy is very common among dioecious plants (those with separate male and female plants; e.g. Westergaard, 1958), while Muller's theory predicts that prevalence in this group should be as low as in animals.</p>

<p><strong>The 'complexity' answer...</strong></p>

<p>Another answer with some historical clout is the one given by Daniel Standage in his answer, and has been given by various scientists over the years (e.g. Stebbins, 1950). This answer states that animals are more complex than plants, so complex that their molecular machinery is much more finely balanced and is disturbed by having multiple genome copies.</p>

<p>This answer has been soundly rejected (e.g. by Orr, 1990) on the basis of two key facts. Firstly, whilst polyploidy is unusual in animals, it does occur. Various animals with hermaphroditic or parthenogenetic modes of reproduction frequently show polyploidy. There are also examples of Mammalian polyploidy (e.g. Gallardo et al., 2004). In addition, polyploidy can be artificially induced in a wide range of animal species, with no deleterious effects (in fact it often causes something akin to hybrid vigour; Jackson, 1976).</p>

<p>It's also worth noting here that since the 1960s Susumo Ohno (e.g. Ohno et al. 1968; Ohno 1970; Ohno 1999) has been proposing that vertebrate evolution involved multiple whole-genome duplication events (in addition to smaller duplications). There is now significant evidence to support this idea, reviewed in Furlong &amp; Holland (2004). If true, it further highlights that animals being more complex (itself a large, and in my view false, assumption) does not preclude polyploidy.</p>

<p><strong>The modern synthesis...</strong></p>

<p>And so to the present day. As reviewed in Mable (2004), it is now thought that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Polyploidy is an important evolutionary mechanism which was and is probably responsible for a great deal of biological diversity.</li>
<li>Polyploidy arises easily in both animals and plants, but reproductive strategies might prevent it from propagating in certain circumstances, rather than any reduction in fitness resulting from the genome duplication.</li>
<li>Polyploidy may be more prevalent in animals than previously expected, and the imbalance in data arises from the fact that cytogenetics (i.e. chromosome counting) of large populations of wild specimens is a very common practise in botany, and very uncommon in zoology.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are now several new suspected factors involved in ploidy which are currently being investigated:</p>

<ul>
<li>Polyploidy is more common in species from high latitudes (temperate climates) and high altitudes (Soltis &amp; Soltis, 1999). Polyploidy frequently occurs by the production of unreduced gametes (through meiotic non-disjunction), and it has been shown that unreduced gametes are produced with higher frequency in response to environmental fluctuations. This predicts that polyploidy should be more likely to occur in the first place in fluctuating environments (which are more common at higher latitudes and altitudes).</li>
<li>Triploid individuals, the most likely initial result of a genome duplication event, in animals and plants often die before reaching sexual maturity, or have low fertility. However, if triploid individuals do reproduce, there is a chance of even-ploid (fertile) individuals resulting. This probability is increased if the species produces large numbers of both male and female gametes, or has some mechanism of bypassing the triploid individual stage. This may largely explain why many species with 'alternative' sexual modes (apomictic, automictic, unisexual, or gynogenetic) show polyploidy, as they can keep replicating tetraploids, thus increasing the chance that eventually a sexual encounter with another tetraploid will create a new polyploid line. In this way, non-sexual species may be a crucial evolutionary intermediate in generating sexual polyploid species. Species with external fertilisation are more likely to establish polyploid lines - a greater proportion of gametes are involved in fertilisation events and therefore two tetraploid gametes are more likely to meet.</li>
<li>Finally, polyploidy is more likely to occur in species with assortative mixing. That is, when a tetraploid gamete is formed, if the genome duplication somehow affects the individual so as to make it more likely that it will be fertilised by another tetraploid, then it is more likely that a polyploid line will be established. Thus it may be partly down to evolutionary chance as to how easily a species' reproductive traits are affected. For example in plants, tetraploids often have larger flowers or other organs, and thus are preferentially attractive to pollinators. In frogs, genome duplication leads to changes in the vocal apparatus which can lead to immediate reproductive isolation of polyploids.</li>

"Why do different humans look different?","8353","","<p>Although farmers appear to be able to tell their cows apart, cows look very much alike to me. And this similarity in appearance seems to be a general trait across the animal kingdom: one individual of one animal species looks much like another.</p>

<p><strong>Why do human facial and body shapes vary so much?</strong></p>

<p>I understand that human beings live in many different environments (e.g. hot and cold) and have adapted to these (e.g. through lighter or darker skin color), but there seems to be much variation that has no apparent evolutionary purpose. So does the difference have a purpose in itself? That is, did we evlove to vary in appearance, and what is the purpose of this variation?</p>
","<p>There is a substantial variation in some human traits: hair colour, eye colour, height, weight, skin colour, build etc. etc. <strong>HOWEVER</strong> there is also considerable variation within other species, to suggest otherwise is naive (though quite common). We often feel like there is more variation within our own species because we are more aware of the subtle differences within our own species (we have evolved to be able to recognise those that are more similar to us). Cows for example also have a lot of variation:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fSWI6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5vmjo.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>But to answer the question of why traits vary so much generally...</strong> There are two principle reasons that demographic patterns might evolve in traits (for example, ""Why do Scandinavians tend to have blonde hair?"" - [this is just an example, I'm not sure if blonde hair is actually more common in Scandinavia, it could just be a stereotype])</p>

<p>Firstly there is the <strong>selectionists</strong> view. This is the view that traits tend to evolve for some kind of adaptive reason, therefore most traits (and demographic patterns of variation) exist for some kind of purpose. A selectionist would argue that blonde hair offers some kind of advantage in Scandinavia, over other hair colours, that it doesn't in others. It could be a naturally or sexually selected advantage (perhaps blonde hair is more useful when hunting prey in snow, or there is mate preference for blonde individuals etc.)</p>

<p>In the 1960's though a scientist called Motoo Kimura proposed the neutral theory, a theory that most variation and traits have evolved by neutral processes. For example, scandinavians might be blonde because the humans that colonized Scandinavia were, coincidentally, blondes. <strong>Neutralists</strong> would argue that the demographic variance we see in humans, and within animal species, is due mainly to random genetic drift.</p>

<p>Here is some more on <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/neutral-theory-the-null-hypothesis-of-molecular-839"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">neutralist vs selectionist</a>, and some on <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIDGeneticdrift.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">genetic drift</a>.

"Are all dinosaur bones radioactive?","8326","","<p>I watching some TV program some time ago and a guy in it mentioned that when-ever museums display real dinosaur bones (as opposed to a replica) the bones are painted over with a lead paint, because they are radioactive.</p>

<p>The sentence was not qualified (so he did not e.g. say that just some bones found somewhere are radioactive).</p>

<p>So is this true of most or all dinosaur bones, or just some of them? If I ever find a huge dino fossil somewhere, should I be concerned?</p>
","<p>While it is true that some fossils can be radioactive, not all of them are. According to the ressources I have found, it depends on the place where these minerals are found and also the other minerals present at this place. </p>

<p>When there are uranium and or potassium rich ores available, the fossils seem to enrich these radioactive isotopes in the calcium matrix of the bone during fossilation. See the reference for some more details on this.</p>

<p>The isotopes which are occurring there are Uranium (U<sup>235</sup> and U<sup>238</sup>), Potassium (K<sup>40)</sup>) and Rubidium (Rb<sup>87</sup>), all of them with half lives in the billion years. Carbon does not play a role in these very old fossils (millions of years old), as the half life of the relevant carbon isotope is to short. These elements are also used for radiodating these fossils, see the table below (from <a href=""http://www.agiweb.org/news/evolution/datingfossilrecord.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VhZs5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Regarding the radioactive safety I think there are some fossils where you should be cautious and carry them around all day long in your pocket. Most of these isotopes release $\alpha$ and $\beta$ radiation, some $\gamma$. While the $\alpha$ radiation is relatively easy to shield, lead can have detrimental effects due to the occurance of retardation radiation of the slowed down particles. In the lab we use thick acrylic glass shields to protect us from $\beta$ radiation.</p>

<p>Additionally I have found some secondary sources for painting the dinosaur bones with lead paint, but no real first hand source from a museum or so. Additionally the rules for radiation safety are pretty strict. If the bones would be so radioactive that a short visit would endanger you (how long are you looking at such pieces, a few minutes at maximum I would say) than they couldn't be shown anyway. Let alone the dangers for the scientists which analyze them. So I would think this is an urban legend.</p>

<p>Why does it even require an ""<em>acceptor</em>"" to accept the electrons and hydrogen ions? What would happen if they were left alone?</p>

<p>I apologize if my question was due to my ignorance in basic chemistry or biology, but do please point it out and explain it to me. Thanks!</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Aren't there any other alternatives for this acceptor?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not that we're aware of. Every other alternative requires an anaerobic environment - which means small, and often less efficient.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oxygen is already recognized to have several harmful effects to cells - wouldn't another molecule be a better choice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we're talking about a molecule's fit there are many things to consider. Primarily its electronegativity, as that determines its stability, ability to accept and donate electrons, protons, and its ease of acquisition given plentiful amounts in the environment.</p>

<p>Molecular Oxygen is comparatively stable to a lot of di-atomic molecules, and comparatively reactive to others. It's in the butter zone for the act of being the terminal acceptor.</p>

<p>Let's think about Fluoride: Almost all of it is bound up in rocks with other elements. It's not available everywhere. It might be an alright candidate if we could eat rocks, but it also replaces minerals in our bones and teeth. Yes, you're familiar with this - but too much leads to fluorosis - where too much of the calcium compound is replaced, and it ends up making the bones and teeth much <strong>weaker</strong>.</p>

<p>Alright, let's think about Nitrogen - Very stable, pretty good electronegativity, abundant... but a little <em>too</em> stable. Yup, it's a gas, it's everywhere, and we can't use a lick of it. It's so stable that it's basically inert. The only reason rhizomes and other beneficial bacteria can use it is because they're in a controlled environment away from oxygen with significantly different biochemical processes which produce much less energy (and probably wouldn't be able to support large multicellular organisms that are as active as we are). So, Nitrogen is out.</p>

<p>Carbon? Nope, as an ion it's dangerously reactive, and as anything else it's too stable. Plus, we're carbon-based! If we used carbon as the terminal acceptor then the proteins handling the electrons would have to be even more exotic and filled with other elements to prevent them accidentally gobbling up the electron and becoming useless.</p>

<p>Sulfur? Not electronegative enough for human purposes, unfortunately. It wouldn't act as a terminal acceptor unless our bodies seriously oxidized it; and any oxidized molecules floating around would be <em>more</em> dangerous than molecular oxygen floating around. Plus most sulfur is bound to minerals as well - not abundant unless you're in the ocean. </p>

<p>Oxygen is both incredibly abundant and easy to perform the chemistry with. More reactive molecules are usually not abundant and tied up in the Earth's crust and could be <em>more dangerous</em>.</p>

<p>Less reactive molecules tend to be so non-reactive that we can't do anything with them, and if we could force them into a state where they would be reactive they tend to be violently reactive or require very specific environments that we can't reproduce on a scale necessary to be as mobile as we are.</p>

<p>Oxygen is not perfect, but it's a good fit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why does it even require an ""acceptor"" to accept the electrons and hydrogen ions? What would happen if they were left alone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same thing that would happen if you clogged a pipe or hose. Once all of the electron acceptors on the transport chain are full, movement stops. The electrons won't be magically absorbed by other parts of the proteins making up the chains, and while there might be errant reactions with other molecules, you'd be lucky to get a whole ATP molecule out in a day - assuming you could magically stay alive.</p>

"Are sensory receptors neurons?","8323","","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>There are many receptor types in the body, with various functions and various mechanisms of transduction. <strong>Receptor cells are considered to be part of the peripheral nervous system</strong>, as they are the first step in conveying information from the periphery to the brain.   </p>

<p><strong>Many receptor cells do not fire action potentials. Action potentials are widely considered to be a key property of neurons</strong>. Instead, receptors often operate by graded responses. For example, upon illumination photoreceptors gradually hyperpolarize. Cochlear hair cells gadually depolarize when the stereocilia are bent into one direction and hyperpolarize when they go in the opposite direction. Hence, many receptors are in fact analog sensors, whereas spiking neurons can be considered to be operating in binary (all-or-nothing) mode.   </p>

<p>Given their similarities and differences, <strong>are receptor cells classified as neurons?</strong></p>

<p><sup>Credits: This question was formulated after a discussion with @OneFace on the question ""<a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28618/relationship-between-nerves-and-axons/28620#28620"">Relationship between nerves and axons</a>""</sup> </p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong>  </p>

<p>Receptor cells are specialized neurons
<br>
<br><br>
<strong>Background</strong>  </p>

<p>There are, globally, three types of neurons (<a href=""http://www.macmillanhighered.com/catalog/static/whf/animalphys5/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eckert's Animal Physiology</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sensory neurons</strong>: these cells transmit information from external stimuli (e.g., sound, light, pressure), or from internal stimuli (e.g., blood oxygen level or head orientation);</li>
<li><strong>Interneurons</strong>: these cells connect other neurons <em>within</em> the central nervous system;</li>
<li><strong>Motor neurons</strong>: these neurons carry effector signals to effector organs, causing contraction of muscles or secretion by gland cells.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following image shows the retinal circuitry, connecting the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells of the optic nerve (interneurons):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2EosJ.png"" alt=""retina""></p>

<p><sup>Source: <a href=""http://www.ib.cnea.gov.ar/~redneu/2013/BOOKS/Principles%20of%20Neural%20Science%20-%20Kandel/gateway.ut.ovid.com/gw2/ovidweb.cgisidnjhkoalgmeho00dbookimagebookdb_7c_2fc~32.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Instituto Balseiro</a></sup></p>

<p>The photoreceptor's response is graded. Notably, <strong>the bipolar cell, being an interneuron has also a graded response</strong>. The bipolar cells convey the signal, in turn, to the ganglion cells that translate the analog, graded signals into a binary, neural spiking code that enters the optic nerve.  </p>

<p>Nonetheless, despite being neurons, <strong>receptor cells are highly specialized</strong>. Although interneurons may come in various shapes and sizes, they are not so specialized as receptor cells. The photoreceptor has a <strong>highly specialized dendritic region</strong> containing the photosensitive pigment and membrane stacks that capture light.  </p>

<p>Another receptor is the Pacinian corpuscle, a vibrotactile mechanoreceptor of the skin:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xjJWF.png"" alt=""PC""><br>
  <sup>Source: <a href=""http://pixgood.com/mechanoreceptor.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pixgood</a></sup></p>

<p>In this case, the receptor cell is in fact a <strong>myelinized and spiking neuron</strong> that functionally much resembles an interneuron. Just as the photoreceptor, the dendritic part does not connect to another neuron, but is highly specialized structure designed to sense a physical external stimulus. In case of the Painian corpuscle, it is an onion-like structure consisting of many lamina. These lamellar structures substantially change the receptor's response to mechanical stimuli. Specifically, it allows the corpuscle to respond rapidly to pressure changes and allow it to faithfully transmit vibratory stimuli.</p>

<li><strong>Predation</strong>: In their struggle against being eaten, bacteria have adopted morphological defenses that may have produced the wealth of shapes we now observe.</li>
</ol>

<p>These factors play a role in shaping bacteria. Further he explains what in general gives the shape to bacteria:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bacterial morphology is affected by a combination of selective pressures - access to nutrients, cell division, attachment/dispersal, predation and motility (among others). Among these different factors, our understanding of the relationship between motility and cell shape is most complete; for example, highly motile bacteria are usually rods with a specific (optimal) shape and size, and movement through viscous fluids seems to a favor spiral shape. But since multiple selective forces are always in play, there is at the moment no way to predict cell shape based on the environment or vice versa.</p>

<p>So adaptations to various environments could be possible but depending upon the environment we can not predict the shape of bacteria because some other factor might have played major role in giving shape to it. But the above mentioned 3 main factors gives some explanation.</p>

"Life without DNA?","8310","","<p>I'm by no means an expert in the field, merely a curious visitor, but I've been thinking about this and Google isn't of much help. Do we know of any lifeforms that don't have the conventional double-helix DNA as we know it? Have any serious alternatives been theorized?</p>
","<p>To follow up what mbq said, there have been a number of ""origin of life"" studies which suggest that RNA was a precursor to DNA,  the so-called ""RNA world"" (1). Since RNA can carry out both roles which DNA and proteins perform today. Further speculations suggest things like a Peptide-Nucleic Acids ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_nucleic_acid"" rel=""noreferrer"">PNA</a>""  may have preceded RNA and so on.</p>

<p>Catalytic molecules and genetic molecules are generally required to have different features. For example, catalytic molecules should be able to fold and have many building blocks (for catalytic action), whereas genetic molecules should not fold (for template synthesis) and have few building blocks (for high copy fidelity). This puts a lot of demands on one molecule. Also, catalytic biopolymers can (potentially) catalyse their own destruction.</p>

<p>RNA seems to be able to balance these demands, but then the difficulty is in making RNA prebiotically - so far his has not been achieved. This has lead to interest in ""metabolism first"" models where early life has no genetic biopolymer and somehow gives rise to genetic inheritance. However, so far this seems to have been little explored and largely unsuccessful (2).</p>

"Do ants or other insects sleep, and if so why?","8282","","<p>I was thinking yesterday about insects (as there was a spider in the house, and I couldn't help but think of anything else, even though they aren't insects), and I started to wonder if ants sleep? </p>

<p>After thinking about it for a while I decided that they might sleep, but then what would be the purpose of sleeping for them? My limited understanding of the need of sleep is that it is used for the brain to compartmentalise the events of the day and allow memories to be formed. But ants don't really have to think about much during the day, given that they act more as a collective than an individual. Or in the case of other insects, they have simpler more instinctive brains which rely on taxis, reflexes and kineses. </p>

<p>So, do ants and other insects sleep (or do they have a different type of sleep to us) and what would the purpose of it be for them?</p>

<p>The main points from the abstract:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, ants sleep.</li>
<li>indicators of deep sleep: 
<ul>
<li>ants are non-responsive to contact by other ants and antennae are folded</li>
<li>rapid antennal movement (RAM sleep)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Queens have about 92 sleep episodes per day, each 6 minutes long.</li>
<li>Queens synchronize their wake/sleep cycles.</li>
<li>Workers have about 253 sleep episodes per day, each 1.1 minutes long.</li>
<li>""Activity episodes were unaffected by light/dark periods.""</li>
</ul>

<p>If you study the paper you might find more information in its introduction or in the references regarding why ants sleep, although there doesn't seem to be scientific consens. The abstract only says that the shorter total sleeping time of the workers is likely related to them being disposable.</p>

","<p>The number of mammary glands a species has is related to litter size.

  <li><p>Cool the LB agar to below 50°C (when you can hold it comfortably) and add the appropriate antibiotic(s). While the agar is still liquid,
  add 1 ml agar to a 2-ml screw-cap vial under sterile conditions, then
  leave to solidify.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Vials of agar can be prepared in batches and stored at room
  temperature until required.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Using a sterile straight wire, pick a single colony from a freshly streaked plate and stab it deep down into the soft agar several times
  (Figure 1).</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼4. Incubate the vial at 37°C for 8–12 h leaving the cap

  <p>When recovering a stored strain, it is advisable to check the

"Why is human vision restricted to 400-700 nm?","8207","","<p>Across the electromagnetic spectrum, 400-700 nm is a narrow spectrum of frequencies and focused in the region of short wavelengths. For example, radio waves cover a large range of frequencies unexploited by the visual system. So what biological reason is there that evolved us to use such a small frequency bandwidth for vision?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
The visible spectrum has the highest energy in sunlight at the earth's surface, explaining the gross location of the visible spectrum in life on earth. The specific frequency range varies across species and can be explained by species-specific survival strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
When you look at the solar light spectrum at the earth's surface the <strong>visible spectrum has the highest intensity</strong> (fig. 1).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4BIlO.jpg"" alt=""solar irradiation""><br>

<p>So it makes sense to use the range of frequencies that is represented most in sunlight as a starting point.  </p>

<p>Then the question becomes, why do <strong>humans utilize approximately 400 to 700 nm</strong>, and not infrared or UV? That can be explained because we do not need it. Our range has been hypothesized to be related to <strong>foraging behaviors</strong> and our visual system is particularly sensitive in the frequency range of the <strong>coloring of (ripe) fruits</strong>, which is thought to have been of great benefit to our hominid ancestors <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/144936/is-there-a-physical-reason-for-colors-to-be-located-in-a-very-narrow-band-of-the"">(Osorio &amp; Vorobyev, 1996)</a>.</p>

<p>Why then do animals extend their vision into <strong>UV</strong>? Many fish, amphibian, reptilian, avian, and some mammalian species use UV vision. Many birds can identify UV-reflected <strong>nectar and berries</strong>, and UV-reflecting plumages in birds, and scales in fishes are used for <strong>recognition</strong> <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/100/14/8308.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Shi &amp; Yokoyama, 2003)</a>. Moreover, some arthropod species are know to use UV vision to <strong>reduce light-reflection distortions</strong> under water, such as in the mantis shrimp that features 12 photoreceptor types (as opposed to four in humans) <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/411.short"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Thoen <em>et al</em>., 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>Why then do animals extend their dynamic range into the <strong>infrared</strong>? A notable beneficial effect of perceiving infrared is the detection of <strong>body heat</strong>. The generation of heat is accompanied by the generation of infrared light. The detection of this emitted light is highly useful for nocturnal predators, like the rattle snake <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-infrared-vision-of-snakes/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Hartline &amp; Newman, 1982)</a>.</p>

"Why would a plant evolve to produce an addictive chemical?","8194","","<p>It seems kind of anti-productive in terms of survival for a plant to produce an addictive chemical as that plant will constantly be sought after by animals that ingest it. In this instance, I'm looking for a possible general &amp; inclusive answer here that would describe most plants that make this. Not a specific instance (although if provided as an example would be a plus).</p>

<p>To appreciate the scope of this is terms of number of plants producing potentially addictive compounds - see this compendium:</p>

","<p>It's a matter of perspective. Most of the chemicals that are addictive to <em>us humans</em> (particularly alkaloids), and may be addictive for some other animals as well, are also insecticides. Lots of plants that we consider poisonous are good food for other species, and lots of plants that insects would consider poisonous are treats for us.</p>

<p>This is a great example of the aimless nature of evolution. The plants that could successfully defend themselves against insects stabilize on a solution that happens to be bad for them in certain ways. Although, you would be hard pressed to find a better way to guarantee reproduction than being addictive to humans.</p>

<p>Others, for example p53 (not an enzyme), have much more structural placiticity - even to the point of being mostly disordered when not bound. They tend to be induced fit binders (of other proteins, not catalytic substrates) and often exploit that to bind a broader range of possible targets than lock and key proteins.</p>

"How is the fluoride in toothpaste absorbed?","8082","","<p>How is the fluoride in toothpaste absorbed by our body? Does the tooth absorb the molecule directly, or is it absorbed by the mouth?</p>

<p>The answers to <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7019/what-nutrients-can-humans-absorb-in-the-mouth"">this question</a> suggest that some materials can be absorbed by the mouth, but fluoride is absent. Additionally, many municipalities <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">add fluoride to tap water</a> which I should imagine is actually absorbed in the stomach by a different mechanism than that of toothpaste.</p>

<p>Note that toothpaste generally comes with stern warnings <a href=""http://blog.younglivingcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Toothpaste-Warning-Label-Toxic.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">not to swallow</a>. Looking at the ingredients it seems the only thing that may be harmful is the fluoride itself. Therefore I <em>suspect</em> that toothpaste has a much higher fluoride concentration than tap water, which supports the notion that its fluoride is absorbed by a different mechanism than tap water.</p>
","<p>The chemical mechanism by which fluoride protects teeth is the <a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remineralisation_of_teeth"">remineralization</a> of hydroxyapatite $\ce{Ca5(PO4)3(OH)}$ in the tooth enamel into fluorapatite $\ce{Ca5(PO4)3F}$:</p>

<p>$$\ce{Ca5(PO4)3(OH) \ (s) + F- \ (aq) -&gt; Ca5(PO4)3F \ (s) + OH- \ (aq)}$$</p>

<p>This reaction occurs at the surface of the enamel, i.e. directly within the mouth.  The fluoride ions participating in the reaction are dissolved in the saliva and other fluids present in the mouth.</p>

<p>Thus, the fluoride does not need to be absorbed into any part of the body (although, as part of the remineralization process, it can be said to be absorbed directly into the tooth enamel), and, in particular, there is no need for it to be swallowed.  Indeed, because of potential adverse effects of high levels of fluoride when absorbed into the body through the digestive tract, swallowing strongly fluoridated dental care products like toothpaste or mouthwash should be avoided.</p>

<p>That said, any fluoride that is swallowed and absorbed into the body, e.g. through fluoridated (or naturally fluoride-rich) drinking water, can still contribute to the remineralization of teeth, simply because some of it will be secreted back into the mouth as part of saliva.</p>

<p>While the fluoride levels in saliva (assuming a safe level of fluoride intake) are much lower than those in, say, toothpaste, your teeth will be <em>constantly</em> exposed to the fluoride in saliva, whereas they will only be exposed to toothpaste for a few minutes each day.  Thus, while the rate of remineralization due to systemic fluoride may be much slower than that due to e.g. fluoridated toothpaste, the total amount of remineralization per day may well be of a comparable magnitude.</p>

<p>Is this just the standard DNA-from-blood extraction procedure or are there multiple options to choose between depending on your research goals? </p>
","<p>There are several reasons why a lab might choose to get DNA from lymphocytes instead of whole blood. Generating genomic DNA from whole blood is not necessarily the best idea, as all the excess protein (mainly hemoglobin from RBCs) needs to be gotten rid of at some point. By narrowing down your input to just include cells that have DNA, you lessen the amount of protein you need to extract in comparison to the total amount of DNA present.</p>

The end result is the same, though - DNA from lymphs should be the same as DNA from PBMCs, granulocytes, or neutrophils.</p>

<p>Any somatic nucleated cell in the body contains <em>""representative""</em> DNA, as except for in a few specialized cell types like T and B cells that undergo genomic rearrangement to form the T- and B-cell receptors, respectively, all cells from an individual contain the same genomic DNA sequence.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C8i8r.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I would prefer ethanol precipitation to ispropanol whenever possible. Isopropanol co-precipates salts, so you have to wash a few times with 70% ethanol and it is less volatile than ethanol, so the drying step takes longer. Its also less effective cleaning organic compounds like phenol away and sometimes the pellets are harder to see.</p>

<p>On the other it can be useful when you have to deal with large volumes, since you only need 0,7 volumes of isopropanol compared with 2,5 volumes of ethanol. </p>

<p>Precipitations with Isopropanol are usually not incubated but centrifuged directly after mixing. Here is a protocol from my lab (which originally came from Qiagen, if I remember correct):</p>

<ul>
<li>Adjust the salt concentration, for example, with sodium acetate (0.3
   M, pH 5.2, final concentration) or ammonium acetate (2.0–2.5 M,
   final concentration).</li>
<li>Add 0.6–0.7 volumes of room-temperature isopropanol to the DNA
       solution and mix well.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the sample immediately at 10,000–15,000 x g for 15–30 min
   at 4°C</li>
<li>Carefully decant the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.</li>
<li>Wash the DNA pellet by adding 1–10 ml (depending on the size of the
preparation) of room-temperature 70% ethanol. This removes
co-precipitated salt and replaces the isopropanol with the more
volatile ethanol, making the DNA easier to redissolve.</li>
<li>Centrifuge at 10,000–15,000 x g for 5–15 min at 4°C</li>
<li>Repeat the washing and centrifugation steps once more.</li>

"Does the human hand have 27 degrees of freedom?","8038","","<p>I have counted the degrees of freedom in my hand over and over and I keep getting the number 19.</p>

<p>Suppose each finger has 3 degrees of freedom. Then 5 * 3 = 15. The wrist can rotate around or back and forth so that contributes to 4 degrees of freedom. In total the hand has 19 degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>From a cursory <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=human+hand+has+27+degrees+of+freedom"" rel=""nofollow"">google search</a>, I can notice that it is commonly agreed upon that human hand has 27 degrees of freedom. Can someone provide a good reference and explanation for this?</p>
","<p>Keeping in mind that I know nothing about this, I will try to explain why the hand can be modelled with 27 degrees of freedom. This is just my interpretation of <a href=""http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~gelkoura/noback/scapaper03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> paper, which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The human hand has 27 degrees of freedom: 4 in each finger, 3 for extension and flexion and one for abduction and adduction; the thumb is more complicated and has 5 DOF, leaving 6 DOF for the rotation and translation of the wrist. </p>
  
  <p>To accurately model the hand, a complete model of the muscles, tendons, bones and a neurological control structure is necessary. The dynamics of such a complex model are still poorly understood, forcing the use of simplified models. Current models are too simplified for our purpose so we turn to recent work from the medical community to motivate assumptions used in a new model that we propose here. We use a 27 DOF model of the hand with the following sim- plifying assumptions:
  1. The thumb is independent of the other fingers.
  2. Adduction/abductionofthefingerjointsareindependent.
  3. Motion frequency does not affect joint interdependence.
  4. Both hands have the same interdependence model.
  5. The posture of the wrist and the rest of the arm do not
  affect the underlying interdependence structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incidentally, this implies to me that there are different models of the hand with different assumptions that use a different number of degrees of freedom. </p>

<p>Anyways, take a look at this hand:

<p>And now, follow along with your own hand!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>finger (4 DOF)</strong>: each finger has 2 interphalangeal joints between the distal, middle and proximal phalanges that allow for flexion/extension (2 DOF); each finger also has a metacarpophalangeal joint between the proximal phalanx and the metacarpal that allows for flexion/extension as well as abduction/adduction (2 DOF)</li>
<li><strong>thumb (5 DOF)</strong>: an interphalangeal joint between the distal and proximal phalanges allowing flexion/extension (1 DOF); a metacarpophalangeal joint between the proximal phalanx and metacarpal allowing flexion/extension and abduction/adduction (2 DOF); a carpometacarpal joint between the metacarpal and trapezium allowing flexion/extension and abduction/adduction (2 DOF)</li>
<li><strong>wrist (6 DOF)</strong>: between the carpals and radius allowing flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and supination/pronation (3 DOF); I think when the authors refer to translation of the wrist, they are simply saying that hand can be moved in all planes of 3D space (ie up/down, side to side, forward/backward - 3 DOF)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we have 4 fingers, they give 16 DOF. Adding the 5 DOF of the thumb and 6 of the wrist, we get 27. Please nobody question my reasoning. Thank you. </p>

"Is there anything that is completely non-toxic to humans at any dose?","8037","","<p>Lately I have seen a number of unrelated ""scientific"" debates over whether certain substances should be outlawed because they are toxic to humans. My initial, informal reaction is usually to respond that anything is toxic to humans if you give them a sufficiently large dose.</p>

<p>However, formally I don't know if that's really true for <em>everything</em> a human being could ingest in some way. I started to wonder if there were some substances that our body could handle unlimited amounts of without any negative consequences.</p>

<p>As this question has been (correctly) identified as a bit vague, I'll try to explain what i'm looking for. For the purposes of this question, I'm willing to ignore the limitations of actually ingesting a given substance in ""the usual way"". For example, if you can't physically drink enough of some liquid fast enough to kill you without your stomach filling up and vomiting, but that same liquid injected intravenously <em>could</em> be lethal, I could consider that toxic. I also recognize that the body can only physically contain a certain volume of stuff, after which sheer pressure would cause it to fail; I'm more interested in ""biochemical toxicity"" as opposed to any physical damage (I just don't know the term for what I'm looking for.)</p>

<p>In other words, one of my goals is to learn if, under laboratory conditions, a properly motivated researcher could <em>always</em> find a dose that would be toxic, regardless of the impracticality of a real person ingesting that dose under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>So, with that qualification, my ultimate question is:</p>

<p><strong>Is there any substance we know of that is completely non-toxic to humans at arbitrarily large doses ingested over an arbitrarily short period of time?</strong></p>
","<p>I’ll answer this theoretically, since that’s how it has been posed. And if we’re ignoring practicalities, we may as well posit that the substance in question will be introduced directly into the bloodstream (This is, of course, simple to do in reality, but not how most people consume their non-toxic substances.) The easiest way to show that any unspecified substance can be toxic at an unlimited volume is to invoke the human body’s mechanisms for volume homeostasis.</p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/24406/9268"">this answer</a>, the human kidneys functioning optimally can produce up to ~ 25 L/day of urine.<sup>1</sup> This would require complete suppression of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ADH</a> (anti-diuretic hormone, a.k.a. arginine vasopressin), which would occur only if the “toxin” load were markedly hypotonic (think water).<sup>2</sup>  There is therefore a theoretical maximum <strong>volume</strong> of any substance that can be dealt with by the body, which is something less than 25 L per day. (For any substance <em>other than</em> water, the maximum will be lower because ADH will not be as fully suppressed by a less hypotonic load.) </p>

<p>A volume of any substance introduced into the bloodstream (including a product precisely mimicking the constituents of the bloodstream itself!) will overwhelm the body’s homeostatic mechanism. This will result in edema which is unpleasant and, in the case of <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000140.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pulmonary edema</a>, certainly pathologic - a “toxidrome” in your scenario. In the case of hypotonic fluids, serum osmolality will also fall causing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hyponatremia</a> with all of its consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: No, the human body can not tolerate an unlimited volume of anything, therefore there is no substance that is non-toxic ""at any dose."" </p>

<p><sub>
2. No, you may not drink 25 liters of water per day. For one thing, urine can not be made with a tonicity of 0 to balance this (more like 60 mOsm/kg minimum). Additionally, ADH can rarely be completely suppressed, yielding a somewhat more concentrated urine and therefore lower tolerance for hypotonic intake before serum osmolality is compromised.

"What are differences between formation of embryonic disc in chick and mammal embryo?","8005","","<p>Exam question which got lowest average points in my university: 1/5 average.
No markscheme available so my attempt below.</p>

<p>I assume that embryonic disk prefers to germ disk such that Formation prefers to only to the <a href=""http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/hdisqueembry/planmoddisque.html"" rel=""nofollow"">3rd developmental week</a> because of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_disc"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia fact</a>. 
I also went through the points during 2nd week of development and did not notice major differences. So let's consider only the 3rd week:</p>

<ol>
<li>Formation of the primitive streak</li>
<li>Genesis of the germ layers</li>
<li>Genesis of the notochord</li>
<li>Location of the epiblast cell target and the development of the primitive streak</li>
<li>The bilaminar membranes</li>
<li>Evolution of the mesoblast</li>
<li>The intraembryonic coelom</li>
<li>Induction of the neural plate – neurulation</li>
</ol>

<p>The following differences are based mostly on Gilbert's Developmental Biology 9e -book.</p>

<p><strong>Other Differences which seems to at least start at the 3rd week of development</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Chick meroblastic cleavage, human holoblastic. TODO do not know how that causes differences yet during the 3rd week.</li>
<li>Chick has yolk, human not so human placenta development and implantation. Chick dependent on yolk nutrients, human not.
Human embryo gets mother nutrients through placenta.
Chorion formation and finally from it the fetal portion of the placenta.
Chorion also includes the uterine cells to form the maternal of the placenta, the decidua.
The decidua will come rich in the blood vessels that will provide oxygen &amp; nutrients to the embryo.
Human oviduct expansion to the uterus.</li>
<li>Chick embryo externally developing from the mother, human not. Chick egg is telocithal with a small disc of cytoplasm: blastodisc - sitting atop a large yolk. The yolk, eggs of birds undergo <strong>discoidal meroblastic cleavage.</strong> Cleavage occurs only in the blastodisc which is about 2-3 mm in diameters &amp; is located at the animal pole of the egg. The first cleavage furrow appears centrally in the blastodisc; other cleavages follow to create a single-layered <strong>blastoderm.</strong>
The cleavages do not extend into the yolk, cytoplasm, so the early-cleavage cells are continuous with one another &amp; with the yolk at their bases. </li>
<li>One chick hypoblast streak, human multiple. Chick must have some control mechanism.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What are the differences between formation of embryonic disc in chick and mammal embryo?</strong></p>
","<p>Embryonic disc forms on top of yolk during cleavage on chicken embryo, while between amniotic sac and yolk sac inside blastocyst after implantation on human embryo.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some further processes take place on and in the embryonic disc: specifically these <a href=""http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/hdisqueembry/planmoddisque.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> during the week 3.</p>

<p>Embryonic disc formation includes still during the 3rd week of development:</p>

<ol>
<li>Formation of the primitive streak</li>
<li>Genesis of the germ layers</li>
<li>Genesis of the notochord</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Formation of the primitive streak:</strong> The process of primary neurulation appears to be similar in chick and mammalian. The embryonic disc becomes oval and then pear-shaped, the wider end being directed forward. Near the narrow, posterior end, the primitive streak makes its appearance and extends along the middle of the disc for about one-half of its length from migrated ectoderm cells.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MYQKv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Genesis of the notochord:</strong> “The notochord extends beneath the neural tube from the base of the head into the tail.” - As the mesoderm develops between the ectoderm and endoderm it is separated into lateral halves by the neural tube and notochord.</p>

<p>Figure 2: Neurulation. NB the use of neural groove is correct. Notochord is below neural groove. - Genesis of germ layers here: from a flat thing to a developed one.</p>

","<p>You are basically correct. Most common usage in my experience:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding"" rel=""nofollow"">Inbreeding</a></strong> refers to sexual reproduction between genetically closely related individuals, within a species. Inbreeding will increase the relatedness between individuals in a population.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbreeding"" rel=""nofollow"">Interbreeding</a></strong> refers to reproduction with another species (or race), and is often used as a synonym to <em>crossbreeding</em> or <em>hybridization</em> (when referring to hybrid offspring from two different species/races/breeds, not DNA hybridization).

","<p>A very good question, and it is most likely because of the last option.  It had a nucleus for part of its life. After the RBC jettisons its nucleus, it still remains very metabolically active for approximately 3 months.  It maintains its cell membrane integrity, it metabolizes glucose, it interacts constantly with its environment, numerous cellular functions and structure remain intact...  It is extremely specialized for a primary purpose, and no longer requires the nucleus to provide more proteins.  It has limited capacity to heal from injury, so it has a limited life span.</p>

<p>Speculation:  I wonder if it might lose the nucleus early on so that when it is destroyed in the spleen at the end of its life as RBCs are, the spleen macrophages are not overwhelmed with additional processing of nucleic acids?

"Serotonin - Does being aroused make you sleepy?","7696","","<p>My Psychology text book says Serotonin causes ""Sleep, arousal levels and emotion""</p>

<p>Does this really mean that when you are being aroused, Serotonin is released, which in turn makes you sleepy? If so, what evolutionary benefit would that have??</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1801"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> [1], serotonin (5HT) inhibits sexual arousal: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dopamine is generally facilitative to male sexual
  behavior; however, 5-HT is regarded as inhibitory.
  Antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake
  inhibitor class (SSRIs, including Prozac and Zoloft)
  impair ejaculatory/orgasmic function and frequently
  inhibit erectile function and sexual interest as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, serotonin can also facilitate erections:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Systemic administration of the 5-HT1B receptor agonist
  anpirtoline impaired ejaculation in male rats. On the
  other hand, stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors with mCPP
  impaired ejaculation but facilitated erections in male
  monkeys, suggesting an increase in parasympathetic
  influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Serotonin release also causes sleepiness after ejaculation in males (<a href=""https://psy.fsu.edu/faculty/hull/DA&amp;5HT_pdf.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5-HT is released in the LHA at the
  time of ejaculation and promotes sexual quiescence during
  the postejaculatory interval</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many signalling molecules used by the human body that have a different effect depending on the cell type they are detected by and the receptor type they activate.</p>

<p>I would also like to touch on your question about evolutionary benefit. Evolution does not care about you <em>after</em> you have reproduced. As long as an individual reproduces, evolution is ""happy"". For example, you think falling asleep after sex is counterproductive on the evolutionary scale? What about Mantises where the female will sometimes eat the male during or immediately after copulation. Falling asleep seems like a pretty small thing compared to that (<a href=""http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1801"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the praying mantis is known for its cannibalistic mating process in actuality it only occurs 5-31% of the time. Especially in laboratory conditions of bright lights and confinement, the female is more likely to eat the male as means of survival. ""In nature, mating usually takes place under cover, so rather than leaning over the tank studying their every move, we left them alone and videotaped what happened. We were amazed at what we saw. Out of thirty matings, we didn't record one instance of cannibalism, and instead we saw an elaborate courtship display, with both sexes performing a ritual dance, stroking each other with their antennae before finally mating. It really was a lovely display"". (7) There is one species, however, the Mantis religiosa, in which it is necessary that the head be removed for the mating to take effect properly. (5) Sexual cannibalism occurs most often if the female is hungry. But eating the head does causes the body to ejaculate faster. (3)</p>

<p>Anything that makes an individual less likely to reproduce will be selected against. Things that happen <em>after</em> reproduction do not affect the survival of the species and will not be subject to selective pressures. </p>

"Are all action potentials the same shape and amplitude when graphed with respect to time?","7675","","<p>The most common visualization of an action potential is a graph of the difference in membrane potential (y axis) at a particular time (x axis).</p>

<p>According to my textbook <em>Cognitive Psychology</em> by E. Bruce Goldstein, an action potential sent from neuron down the axon remains the same. That is, if we plot the action potential as described above, then at each as it is propagated down it will have the same shape on the graph (within some range of error obviously, but he is saying the error is trivial). 
But he then says on page 34 </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One way to answer the question of how action potentials determine different qualities [(e.g. taste of something sweet)] is to propose that the action potentials for each quality might look different. However, [Edgar] Adrian rules out that possibility by determining that all action potentials have basically the same height and shape. </p>

<p><strong>My Question</strong></p>

<p>Can someone confirm these two facts: </p>

<ol>
<li>Once an action potential is sent from a given neuron down the axon, does the shape and amplitude remain constant as it is propagated? </li>
<li>Do all action potentials have the same amplitude and shape? </li>

</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IoSje.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Reason is that most axons are not passive tubes of electrolyte with leakage (in which case AP would be attenuated along it) but rather active media with membrane potential across that have ion channels that reproduce initial action potential along the axon. However, in more passive tubes, like in dendrites, action potentials might be attenuated.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Generally, no. Amplitude of action potential depends on properties of ion channels, at what potential, for example, $K^+$ channels will open to start repolarization (peak of AP). Duration also depends on properties of ion channels. But since there are not a lot of variability in ion channels and extracellular ion composition is mainly same in animals, most of APs will have same shape/duration/amplitude.</li>

How does the human body metabolize gasoline? Also, what are the side-affects to gasoline? </p>
","<p>Just to add an answer to the 'how does the body process gasoline?' portion of the question, the liver and kidney would be doing most of the work of removing the stuff from the system once it was absorbed in the digestive tract.  </p>

<p>The liver does most of the processing of toxins and their removal from the blood and would tend to do the most work in removing hydrocarbons from gasoline.  It has enzymes that oxygenate toxins (adds oxygens) which make them more soluable in the blood, usually less toxic, and also removable from the body by the liver or the kidney. In the case of gasoline the compounds are likely to be just as toxic.  </p>

<p>The kidney works by actively filtering out excess water and mostly water soluable wastes like oxygenated hydrocarbons.  Kidney damage occurs when gasoline is ingested in excess.  This may be due to the toxicity of the gasoline, but also due to the compounds the liver is producing. </p>

<p>Gasoline will tend to be fat soluable too, so it will leave the system more slowly, even after being processed by the liver (benzene and toluene in gasoline will tend to become phenols which are quite toxic and fat soluable). </p>

"Why do we grow so much hair on our heads compared to our bodies?","7609","","<p>I've been wondering about head hair, facial hair in particular. Human males can grow very extensive beards should they choose to not shave - however you do not really see this in our chimpanzee cousins! Yes, they have little pseudo-beards, but the difference being that they do not shave, that is just the length they reach.

<p>Wheeler's hypothesis is that naked, bipedal hominids could have tolerated higher ambient temperatures as well as elevated metabolic heat production. Naked skin would confer higher levels of evaporative cooling, but would have entailed more water loss. </p>

<p>Wheeler argues that bipedalism necessarily would have preceded loss of hair, which seems to agree with Carrier's (<a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2742907?uid=3739560"">1984</a>) hypothesis that early hominids were distinguished not by large brains but by upright, bipedal postures with striding gaits.

"How many humans have been in my lineage? Is it almost the same for every human currently living?","7608","","<p>If I were to count my father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather, and so on up till, say chimps, or the most common ancestor, or whatever that suits the more accurate answer, how many humans would there have been in my direct lineage?</p>

<p>And would it be almost the same for every human being currently living?</p>
","<p>A quick back-of-the-envelope answer to the number of generations that have passed since the estimated human-chimp split would be to divide the the split, approximately 7 million years ago (<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15716"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Langergraber et al. 2012. Generation times in wild chimpanzees and gorillas suggest earlier divergence times in great ape and human evolution. PNAS 109(39)"">Langergraber et al. 2012</a>), by the human generation time. The human generation time can be tricky to estimate, but 20 years is often used. However, the average number is likely to be higher. Research has shown that the great apes (chimps, gorilla, orangutan) have generation times comparatble to humans, in the range of 18-29 years (<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15716"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Langergraber et al. 2012. Generation times in wild chimpanzees and gorillas suggest earlier divergence times in great ape and human evolution. PNAS 109(39)"">Langergraber et al. 2012</a>).</p>

<p>Using 7 million years and 20 years yields an estimated <strong>350000 ancestral generations</strong> for each living human. A more conservative estimate, using an average generation time of 28, would result in 250000 generations. However, some have argued that the human-chimp split is closer to 13 million years old, which would mean that approximately 650000 generations have passed (using a generation time of 20 years). </p>

<p>The exact number of ancestral generations for each human will naturally differ a bit, and some populations might have higher or lower numbers on average due to chance events or historical reasons (colonizations patterns etc). However, due to the law of large numbers my guess would be that discrepancies are likely to have averaged out. In any case, the current estimates of the human-chimp split and average historical generation times are so uncertain, so that they will swamp any other effects when trying to calculate the number of ancestoral generations.</p>

<p>However, this is only answering the number of ancestral generations. The <strong>number of ancestors in your full pedigree</strong> is something completely different. Since every ancestor has 2 parents, the number of ancestors will grow exponentially. Theoretically, the full pedigree of ancestors can be calculated using:</p>

<p>$$N_\text{ancestors} = \sum_{i=1}^t 2^i \hspace{1em} \text{or} \hspace{1em} 2^{t+1}-2$$</p>

<p>where t is the number of generations. However, this will yield an unreasonably large number of ancestors (~$2.3*10^{105}$ over just 350 generations), since it assumes that all of your ancestors are unrelated. Basically, you run into something called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_collapse"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pedigree collapse</a>, which means that your pedigree will have many overlaps (due to inbreeding, overlapping generations etc), so all of your ancestors cannot be seen as unrelated. In practice, this means that the number of ancestors in successive generations will stop doubling for each generation you go back, and will eventually start shrinking, which will drastically reduce the number of unique ancestors. For more on this, see answers to the question <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16147/initial-population-when-i-count-backwards/16160#16160"">Initial population when i count backwards?</a>. That question is basically asking about the same issue, but less specifically. There might be studies that have tried to calculate the average number of ancestors to living humans, but I haven't seen any. Therefore, I cannot say anything more specific about the average number of unique ancestors for a living human individual.</p>

I looked on Wikipedia and there no mention of it in the testosterone article. Through Googling around I also didn't find a list of which hormones can cross the barrier.</p>
","<p>Yes, both steroid and peptidic hormones can enter the brain, the obvious proof being that the brain responds to changing blood concentration of hormones.</p>

<p>The situation is different for steroid hormones (such as estrogen, testosterone, cortisol etc) which are small and lipophilic, and peptidic hormones (such as insulin, ghrelin, prolactin etc) which are big and hydrophilic.</p>

<p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is selectively permeable to steroid hormones: some of them (such as the gonadal steroids) can readily pass the BBB, while others (such as corticosteroids) pass only in small concentrations. This may however be modulated by hormone carrier proteins in the plasma.</p>

<hr>

<p>When speaking of peptidic hormones, the classic hypothesis is that hormones pass through the areas where the BBB is ""leaky"", i.e. where capillaries are fenestrated. 
These include <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumventricular_organs"" rel=""nofollow"">circumventricular organs</a> such as the median eminence (where the terminals of many neuroendocrine neurons are located), or the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), important for reproduction and osmoregulation.

","<p>Photosynthesis is the process of trapping sunlight and converting the energy into chemical energy which is then provided as a food source. </p>

<p>So the sunlight is trapped through chlorophylls. This is a pigment in the organelle called the chloroplast. The upper surface of the leaf is open to sunlight where the plants have more chloroplasts containing more chlorophylls to trap the most amount of sunlight. </p>

<p>All these chlorophylls are green coloured and since there is an increased amount of chlorophylls in the upper surface than in the lower surface (to trap more and more sunlight), the upper surface appears to be greener than the lower surface. </p>

</ul>
","<p>Let me clarify my answer since it is lower quality than people may like.  To answer the question, my friend is a horticulist and has given a more detailed answer.</p>

<p>Subspecies is the most generic, <a href=""http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp"" rel=""noreferrer"">taxonomically-defined</a> term one rank order lower than species. The subspecies (either an individual subspecies, or collective group of subspecies) are defined to be genetically or morphologically distinct among other subspecies belonging to the same species, yet still produce viable offspring from interbreeding. For example, every type of dog is a sub-species of <em>Canis familiaris</em>, and all dogs are capable of breeding with each other. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies"" rel=""noreferrer"">Subspecies</a>, abbreviated Ssp, may refer to an individual subspecies type, or a collective group of related subspecies when a distinct subset is difficult to define or unknown.</p>

<p>There are a variety of terms that are analogous to subspecies, when the strict definition does not apply, or a different term has been used historically. For example, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varietal"" rel=""noreferrer"">varietal</a> is the botanical term, and refers to a named subspecies. For example, grapes are a family of species, divided into the various subspecies, and a varietal is a specific subspecies that we refer to by a more common or familiar name, such as Riesling, Chardonnay, etc. (Grapes are a slightly different case in which most grapes are produced from hybrids or crosses for reasons of withstanding environmental conditions avoiding insect prey and fungal infections.) Microbiology has yet another distinction, called a strain. Strains are often genetically different, and yet all belong to a species. For example, several E. coli strains exist. In contrast, viruses are also given strain/subspecies names which don't technically fit the ICZN definition of interbreeding. Cultivar is a similar term, also from the field of botany. Cultivar is specifically applied to plants that are grown for some agricultural benefit, and have been bred or altered by humans for some reason.</p>

<p>In short, there is a zoological definition of subspecies set out in ICZN. This definition requires viable interbreeding among subspecies belonging to the same species. The term applies to individuals, or groups, as the context dictates. Analogous terms of subspecies are applied (adapted?) to other realms of biology, such as botany, microbiology and virology, but the definitions are slightly different, but consistent within the branch of biology (eg, viruses can't breed so they don't fit the ICZN definition, but the term applies). Ssp can also be qualitatively used to describe an unknown subset of a species (I've seen this used in microbiology mostly).</p>

<p>Crosses/hybrids are indicated with the ""x"" in the nomenclature. Since I found this confusing, I'm copying from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_%28biology%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From a taxonomic perspective, hybrid refers to offspring resulting
  from the interbreeding between two animals or plants of different
  species.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Hybrids between different subspecies within a species
  (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as
  intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the
  same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are sometimes known as
  interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera
  (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids.</p></li>
  <li><p>The second type of hybrid consists of crosses between populations,
  breeds or cultivars within a single species. This meaning is often
  used in plant and animal breeding, where hybrids are commonly produced

"Do babies resemble their father?","7571","","<p>An often heard theory is that newborns and babies resemble the father more than the mother, a theory apparently ignited by a Nature paper by <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v378/n6558/abs/378669a0.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Christenfeld and Hill (1995)</a>. Figure 1 shows one of the tests images. His subjects had to guess which picture was the real dad and which was the real mom.

<p>It is suggested that paternal matching of a baby promotes identification of the father with his offspring. In turn, self-identification in his kin would prevent the father from doing harm and stimulate protective paternal behavior. This then is hypothesized to increase survival rates of his offspring and <em>et voila</em>, a trait is born (pardon the pun) that makes baby paternal look-alikes fitter than those that don't. This hypothesis seems to have become part of parenting folklore.   </p>

<p>However, a <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/babies-paternal-resemblance/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scientific American paper by Matson (2011)</a> contests this view and puts forward several primary research studies showing no preferred resemblance between mother or father, or even predominantly maternal features in babies.</p>

","<p><strong>Resemblance between parent and offspring is certainly true</strong>. Some traits are more obvious than others, for example skin colour would be very obvious. As babies mature they will gradually begin to look more and more like their parents, the features of babies often change rapidly, for example pretty much every baby has a little nose, but by the time they are a fully grown adult it probably resembles that of one the parents fairly well.</p>

<p>More obvious example would be height - imagine being presented with a baby and two males who are identical in every way, except one is two metres tall, and the other is 1.5 metres tall. As a baby it would be very difficult to assign paternity on the criteria of height/size, <strong>but as the child develops it would likely become easier and easier</strong>.</p>

<p>The resemblance between parent and offspring relates to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heritability</a> of a trait but, because there can be <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH1x5aRtjSQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>temporal variation within an individual</strong></a>, heritability can only be properly determined by measuring the traits in parent and offspring at the same time point (e.g. father's height at 18 years old and son's height at 18 years old), otherwise it will introduce noise in to the estimation, likely reducing the estimate of heritability (and specific to your question, making it harder to assign paternity based on phenotypic characters).</p>

<p><strong>In the context of your question:</strong> Ability to assign paternity would depend on a) the resolution with which the traits available can be distinguished among all individuals in the test and b) the variance among all individuals in the test. E.g. If the only trait available was number of fingers per hand, and all potential fathers and the child had five then the lack of variance would make it impossible to use this as a criterion, while if both one of the potential fathers, and the focal baby, had six fingers on one hand then there would be pretty good clue.</p>

<p>Whether babies more resemble their fathers more than mothers (which I think is the true question you are asking here) there is <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/info/10.1086/673296"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">evidence from <em>Drosophila</em> that within-sex heritability is much higher than cross-sex for lifespan and aging,</a> i.e. the lifespan of males (females) far more resembles the lifespan of the father (mother) than the mother (father). This would suggest that there is a sex specific element. Meanwhile there is <a href=""http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1748/4836"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">evidence of high cross-sex genetic correlations in humans preventing</a> males and females from becoming more different (thus maintaining resemblance to opposite sex parents). I would think that resemblance to the father could offer some benefit in assigning paternity by care giving males (stopping males devoting resources to other males offspring) but some of the resemblance could be generated by genetic correlations to sex-specific genetic variance, for example, males (females) will look more like their father (mother) in many ways purely because they are of the same sex, so it will heavily depend on the traits you look at to judge resemblance.</p>

","<p>Phosphorylation can occur on specific amino acids only, what you have called phosporylation sites. These amino acids are Ser, Tyr, Asp, Thr and His. In theory any of these amino acids may be phosphorylated, but in reality it may not actually occur for a number of reasons. Some of these are because of the change in overall charge of the protein which can influence the 3D conformation, or the amino acids are not accessible to specific kinases, etc. If you ask for the purposes of doing a Western blot, then the antibody specification sheet should indicate whether a phosphorylated form exists and there should be a reference to the literature describing this modification.</p>

"How will rising carbon dioxide levels in the troposphere affect photosynthetic producers?","7554","","<p>Much discussion has been had about the affects of climate change on plantlife, but how will rising carbon dioxide concentrations affect the photosynthetic process itself? Since CO₂ is a reagent in photosynthesis, would we expect higher CO₂ to mean an increased rate of photosynthesis in a real-world context? Has there been any research on this? </p>

<p>I am thinking more of large-scale field tests rather than lab plants.</p>
","<p>There are several key ways in which rising atmospheric CO₂ concentrations will affect photosynthesis, and these are related to the different types of photosynthesis. In order to properly answer your question, I'll provide some background about photosynthesis itself.</p>

<p>Photosynthesis evolved in a high-CO₂ atmosphere, before the oxygen-enrichment of the atmosphere (which actually happened as a result of photosynthesis). Most plant species operate <strong>C3 photosynthesis</strong>. In these plants, carbon dioxide diffuses into the cell where it is fixed by <strong>Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO)</strong> into a 3-carbon molecule (hence C3), which is then polymerised to make sugars. A crucial fact about RuBisCO is that it has both carboxylase (carbon-fixing) activity and oxygenase (oxygen-fixing) activity. This means that oxygen and carbon dioxide compete for the active site on the enzyme complex, leading to RuBisCO being quite inefficient and slow at fixing carbon in higher oxygen concentrations. That didn't matter in the high-CO₂ atmosphere of the early Earth, but in todays atmosphere O₂ concentrations are high enough that they severely limit the productivity of C3 plants.</p>

<p>However, plants haven't just been growing slowly all that time - several mechanisms for increasing photosynthetic efficiency have evolved. The most influential systems involve concentrating carbon dioxide in a particular area, excluding oxygen, and concentrating RuBisCO in that same area. This avoids the oxygen competition for the active site and allows RuBisCO to operate more efficiently. The key adaptation here is <strong>C4 photosynthesis</strong> - the system which is present in most grasses and many of the most productive plants on Earth (e.g. maize, sugarcane, Miscanthus). It has evolved at least 62 times independently. It works by having RuBisCO concentrated within 'bundle sheath' cells which are surrounded by a layer of suberin wax. This layer prevents CO₂ escaping and O₂ from getting in. CO₂ from the atmosphere is then fixed in different cells - 'mesophyll cells' - by another enzyme - <strong>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC)</strong>, resulting in a four-carbon molecule (hence C4). This 4-carbon acid, (malate or oxaloacetate depending on the system) is then shuttled into the bundle sheath cells. There, the CO₂ is released again by a variety of enzymes depending on the system, creating a high CO₂ concentration in the cell where RuBisCO can then work efficiently.</p>

<p>In general, C4 plants are much (about 50%) more efficient than their C3 counterparts, and they are particularly well adapted to high temperatures and moist environments. So, to answer your first question: as atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise, C3 plants will gradually be able to photosynthesise more efficiently. Interestingly though, C4 plants are predicted to also benefit from increased atmospheric CO₂. If global temperatures rise as predicted, both C3 and C4 plants will be able to operate more efficiently than they currently do, up to a maximum temperature beyond which enzymes will begin to denature faster and efficiency will drop. One consideration is that the difference in efficiency between C3 and C4 systems will decrease, which may significantly alter the makeup of plant communities around the world.</p>

<p>This is a vast oversimplification, but it is accurate for the predicted overall effects. Localised effects (i.e. productivity changes in a particular region or for a particular crop) will depend on habitat, physiology, etc.</p>

"When running gels what is the difference between constant volts or constant amps?","7538","","<p>In general, you want to be consistent with running your gels either at constant volts or constant amps.

","<p>I'll answer only for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDS-PAGE"" rel=""nofollow"">SDS-Page</a>, which is the system I am most familiar with.</p>

<p>With a discontinuous buffer system, such as the well-known <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5432063"" rel=""nofollow"">Laemmli</a> system, resistance <strong>increases</strong> during electrophoresis, as (very mobile) chloride ions are replaced by glycinate (glycine ions). </p>

","<p>Growth can be quite slow for some species under certain conditions when the concentration of cells is too low. Log-phase growth is powerful, and so one would like to keep cells in this state for the experiment at hand. Different genes are expressed then compared to a stationary phase.</p>

"Measuring Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) using Light and Dark Bottle methods: Sample Question","7512","","<p>The following question is taken from my Cliffnotes AP Biology 4th edition practice exam and it deals with the light and dark method for measuring gross primary productivity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a classroom investigation, students filled two bottles with pond water containing only photosynthesizing organisms. They used a dissolved oxygen (DO2) sensor to measure the amount of dissolved oxygen in each bottle. One bottle was put under a light. The second bottle was wrapped with aluminum foil to block all light and was put under the same light. AFter 24 hours, pond water DO2 in the two bottles was again measured. Average values for DO2 from all students are provided in the following table.

  <p>Calculate the gross primary productivity for the observed sample. Express your answer in mg fixed carbon/L/day to the nearest hundredth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so I know that net primary production (NPP) is the difference between gross primary production (from photosynthesis) minus Autotrophic respiration (Ra):</p>

<p>NPP = GPP - Ra</p>

<p>I also understand that the light bottle is measuring NPP, because it allows for both photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The dark bottle measures Ra because it only allows for respiration. Therefore, GPP can be calculated by rearranging the formula:</p>

<p>GPP = NPP + Ra</p>

<p>Calculating the difference in the final and initial values for both bottles, I get the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Light: 0.15 mg O2 / L   &lt;-- NPP</p>
  
  <p>Dark: -0.08 mg O2 / L   &lt;-- Ra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, I plugged these into the formula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GPP = 0.15 - 0.08 = 0.07 mg O2 / L</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the conversion formulas provided on the College Board's AP Bio Appendix (essentially just multiplying the mg O2 / L value by 0.374128 to get mg Carbon fixed / L), I get the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0.07 mg O2 / L * 0.374128 = 0.02618896 mg C fixed / L</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But according to my review book's solution, I was supposed to add 0.08, not subtract it. This seems a bit strange to me. Is this a mistake in the book or am I not understanding something?</p>
","<p>The dynamics are:</p>

<pre><code>Light bottle: GPP - Ra = 0.15
Dark bottle : Ra = 0.08
</code></pre>

<p>Then GPP = 0.15 + 0.08.</p>

<p>The amount of O2 used in the respiration is 0.08 mg O2 / L, not -0.08 mg O2 / L.</p>

<p>I am new to bioinformatics, and I have not found any conclusive answers for all these concepts on the web.</p>
","<p>My understanding of those three words as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>sequence</strong> is a generic name describing order of biological letters (DNA/RNA or amino acids). Both contigs and reads are DNA/RNA or aa sequences </p></li>
<li><p><strong>reads</strong> are just a short hand for sequenced reads. Usually sequenced reads refer to somewhat digital information obtained from the sequencing machine (for example Illumina MySeq) and stored in the <code>fastq</code> file with quality scores per base. Reads are usually short. However ""short"" changes rapidly. Right now MySeq produces reads anywhere between 50-150 base pairs long (bp). From a single run (it will really depends on the run) you can get millions of reads, where each read will be set bp size e.g 100bp long. All reads are stored in a single <code>fastq</code> file per replicate, where all reads in that file are usually of uniform size e.g all 5 million reads are 100bp long.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>contigs</strong> are simply reads that have been assembled together. For example if you are doing <em>de novo</em> transcriptomics. Then you would:</p>

<li>purify your transcript from a tissue and send it off for sequencing</li>
<li>get your fastq files with sequenced reads, that are all short reads

<p>Now I know there are more men than women who dies in homicides, suicides, work accidents, wars, etc. men are more likely to get addictions because of depression, etc. but aside of all that, is there any biological reason why men lives less than women everywhere?  </p>
","<p>There are both biological and  social factor for that:</p>

<h1>Biological</h1>

<ul>
<li>Females have two X chromosomes. When mutations in genes of the X chromosome occur, females have a second X to compensate. Males, on the other hand gave just one chromosome X and all genes its genes express themselves, even those lethal or deleterious. </li>
<li>Females have better resistance to biological aging and hormones and the role of women in reproduction are known to be associated to greater longevity (e.g. estrogen offers some protection against heart disease because it facilitates elimination of bad cholesterol while testosterone has been linked to violence and risk taking).</li>
<li>The female body evolved to accommodate the needs of pregnancy and breast feeding hence deals better with making reservation. This ability has been linked to a female's better ability to cope with overeating and eliminating excess food</li>

<h1>Social</h1>

<p>This ""advantage"" women seem to have was once nullified by the status and life conditions they had back then, as the risks and the burden of pregnancy and the lack of attention to health and rights women had in a way more misogynist world. </p>

<p>Given the economic, social and political changes that the world experienced, a general progress in female life conditions took place and women have not only regained their biological advantage, but have gone beyond it, achieving higher life expectation. Social and comportamental factor are involved in this higher longevity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Women tend to engage in fewer risky and bad for health behaviors than men do, e.g. men have more problems than women with alcoholism, smoking and road accidents.</li>
<li>The world is still very sexist and the gender roles to be played would expose men to higher risks. Regarding to work, for instance, although women nowadays participate in the work force, their professional activities remain different and are less prejudicial to their health (on average). </li>
<li>Also regarding to  very sexist gender roles, men are expected to be strong and manly and powerful and women are expected to be gracious young and beautiful. As a result of that, women are more attentive to their body and health, engage themselves in more healthy activities and benefit more from medicine and science. Men on the other hand submit their bodies to challenges from early ages and tend to neglect their bodies needs.</li>

"What is the purpose of gluconeogenesis?","7379","","<p>The gluconeogenesis pathway seems quite pointless to me.

The pathway seems only to serve as a complete waste of energy?</p>

<p>Can someone explain why we have gluconeogenesis and when it is used?</p>
","<p>Gluconeogenesis is not the reversal of the glycolysis, but the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors (like odd chain fatty acids and proteins). The reason why we have this process is because some organs and tissues can only use glucose as their energy source. These include the brain (although ketone bodies can be used here as well), erythrocytes, testes and the kidney medulla.</p>

<p>Usually the glucose for the supply of these tissues comes directly from carbohydrates in food or storage carbohydrates as glycogen or starch, but when these are not available, the body has another way to get around this problem and to avoid the starvation of these tissues.

<p>The concept of dominance can be used for any quantitative trait. Typically, when the quantitative trait of interest is fitness, then the trait often depend on the environment. A typical and interesting case is when the fitness depends on the frequency of alleles in the population. Depending of the frequency of the allele at a given locus, the relationship might be a relationship of dominance, additivity or dominance for the other allele.</p></li>

<p>I can suspect that amino-acid sequences are more stable than nucleotide sequences, to the presence of synonymous substitutions.... but, is this stability required between closely related species? doesn't it make the analysis less powerful? does it make it more reliable?

","<p>In general, many sequence alignment programs can use multiple <a href=""http://www.molecularevolution.org/resources/models"">substitution models</a>, distinguishing between nucleotides, amino acids, and codons. A protein sequence has functional information that is not directly visible in the nucleotide sequence. </p>

<p>The papers you link deal with horizontal gene transfer, where a gene is passed to more distant  organism. Different species have different codon usage biases, i.e. the translation efficiency is different for different codons. On one hand, this means that HGT is more likely to occur between <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3113575/"">species of similar codon usage</a>. On the other hand, ""<a href=""http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/5/792.full"">codon usage of horizontally transferred genes approaches the host usage over time</a>.""

"How does a brain distinguish stimuli?","7327","","<p>If all the brain ever ""sees"" is action potentials, how do we know that one set of action potentials denotes a flash of light, another one signifies a loud sound, etc ?</p>
","<p>The fundamental way in which this works is by geography: signals triggered by different stimuli travel by different pathways to different regions of the brain that are specialised for dealing with the sorts of information they contain.</p>

<p>For example, visual signals from the retina pass down the optic nerve and (after a few interesting twists and turns that, <em>inter alia</em>, send the left and right halves of each visual field to different brain hemispheres) wind up in the visual cortex, which contains neuronal networks adapted for recognising different structures and regularities in the image. Whereas sound information from the ears, after an even more tortuous sequence of processing steps, winds up in the auditory cortex.</p>

<p>Along the way, the signals will typically be split up across many neurons and reintegrated into new signals that pick out different kinds of information. So a particular stimulus will result in a complex spatio-temporal pattern of action potentials firing across many regions of the brain.</p>

<p>Conceptually, the further along this process you go, the more abstracted the signal probably becomes, so that it stands for a collection of events and ideas and thoughts rather than for excited photoreceptors or vibrating hair cells. But exactly how this parsing of the sensory content eventually turns into perception and conscious recognition is essentially unknown.</p>

"Can the human eye distinguish colors in the periphery?","7301","","<p>In the back of my mind I have the idea that human eyes can't notice the color of objects in the far periphery, and that any subjective perception of colors is done by the brain that tries to fill in the color percept.</p>

<p>Is that true? </p>
","<p>It depends to some degree on what you define as peripheral vision. Until relatively recently, color vision in the peripheral field has been thought to be substantially less developed than color vision in the central field. </p>

<p>Most estimates of peripheral color perception place the limit of trichromatic (RBG) vision at no more than 30 degrees from fixation; the visual field was thought to be completely color blind at about 50 degrees of eccentricity.</p>

<p>Within the last 30 years, an increased understanding of the changing spatial scale in the peripheral field has led researchers to reevaluate what is believed about peripheral function. Virtually every measure of peripheral color perception can be improved by using a suitably large stimulus in the peripheral field.<sup><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jjsDG.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Here is a schematic of distribution of cones in the retina. While cones are decreased in number at 60°, they do exist.<sup><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/faOv5.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Previous measured sensitivity curves farther into the periphery than thought. In one paper, detection thresholds for colored disks showed that color vision, in particular color vision mediated by the L – M cone-opponent channel (luminance or blue–yellow colors), persists up to at least 50 deg. The larger the color disc, the better the peripheral color vision.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The range of eccentricities over which red–green color vision is still possible is larger than previously thought. Color stimuli can be reliably detected and identified by chromatically opponent mechanisms even at 50 deg eccentricity. Earlier studies most probably underestimated this range. Differences could be caused by technical limitations and <em>the use of stimuli of non-optimal size.</em> (Emphasis mine) In agreement with previous studies we found that the decline in reddish-greenish L − M color sensitivity was greater than for luminance and bluish-yellowish S − (L + M) signals. We interpret our findings as being consistent with a functional bias in the wiring of cone inputs to ganglion cells (Buzás et al., 2006) that predicts a decrease but not a lack of cone-opponent responses in the retinal periphery.  </p>

"Why Did 6 Great Ape Species Survive But Only 1 Hominid Species?","7294","","<p>My dad asked this question when I explained some circumstances surrounding <em>Homo sapiens</em> survival against all odds.</p>

<p>We know there is only one hominid species left in the world, <em>Homo sapiens</em>. We also know that there are only 6 other species of great apes left: 2 species of chimpanzees, 2 species of gorillas, and 2 species of orangutans. These 7 species are the last remaining in the family Hominidae.</p>

<p>All the other hominids besides <em>Homo sapiens</em> died out tens of thousands of years ago, and we believe the reason our ancestors survived is because we were more ""adaptable"", meaning we were not restricted to a single environment but could survive in many others. This is the reason we later spread out all over the world, and probably why we gained ""sapience"" and are able to contemplate these grim circumstances.</p>

<p>At one point, following the eruption of the Toba volcano 70,000 years ago, there were between 1,000 and 10,000 mating pairs of <em>Homo sapiens</em> left, though there may have been other hominid species alive at the time. My dad asked, if the hominids faced such grueling environments and all but a few died, why did the great apes fare any better? Why are there 6 extant non-human Hominidae species left, but only 1 hominid species?</p>
","<p>Determining why one species (or group of species survived) while others did not can be difficult to answer, but I can offer one possible explanation for the genus <em>Homo</em>: competition. Competition between similar species is one possibility. Consider for example gorillas or chimps. The two species of gorillas occupy different habitats so they rarely compete with each other for resources (food, water, shelter, etc.). The two species of chimpanzees have non-overlapping ranges (or minimally so) so again they do not compete for resources.</p>

<p>Chimps and gorillas do overlap with each other for parts of their range and even potentially use the same resources, although no competition for resources has been observed (see <a href=""http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/gorilla"">this primate factsheet</a> and McNeilage 2001). The same applies for the orangutans, which lives on two different southeast Asian islands.</p>

<p>The genus <em>Homo</em> is an entirely different story. As you may know, <em>Homo</em> first evolved in east central Africa. The first species to leave Africa and disperse across Europe and Asia was <em>Homo erectus</em>. This migration out of Africa happened as early as aout 1.8 million years ago. <em>Homo sapiens</em> had not yet evolved. However, while <em>H. erectus</em> was establishing itself across Europe and Asia, populations still in Africa continued to evolve.</p>

<p>Modern <em>Homo sapiens</em> evolved in central Africa perhaps about 250-200,000 years ago and dispersed out of Africa about 100,000 years ago. <em>Homo sapiens</em> also dispersed across Europe and Asia. Both <em>H. erectus</em> and <em>H. sapiens</em> co-occurred across parts of their range. Some have argued (Stringer and Andrews, among others, I believe but I'll have to be at work before I can verify ths reference) that <em>H. sapiens</em> outcompeted <em>H. erectus</em>, leading to its eventual extinction by competition. They occurred together and used the same resources, so <em>H. sapiens</em> could have caused the extinction of <em>H. erectus</em>. This has been called the replacement hypothesis. The later evolving species (<em>H. sapiens</em>) replaced the earlier evolving <em>H. erectus</em>.</p>

<p>However, <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v416/n6876/abs/416045a.html"">Templeton (2002)</a> has argued that the two species interbred so the species became integrated rather replaced (if I am interpreting him correctly).  While I don't dispute the possibility of interbreeding, I am skeptical of Templeton's complete dismissal of replacement.</p>

<p>Complicating the picture is <em>H. neanderthalensis</em>. Genetic evidence published by <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/710.full"">Green et al. (2010)</a> suggests that Neanderthals diverged from <em>H. sapiens</em> (in central Africa) between 800,000-500,000 years ago and also dispersed out of Africa.  They also provided evidence of interbreeding between <em>H. sapiens</em> and <em>H. neanderthalensis</em> in Europe.  Modern <em>H. sapiens</em> may also have outcompeted <em>H. neanderthals</em>. </p>

<p>All of this was occurring during the Pleistocene ice age. Europe was experiencing repeated bouts of extensive glaciation. Thus, it is also possible that climate change caused or contributed to the extinction of <em>H. erectus</em>, <em>H. neanderthalensis</em>, or both.</p>

<p>In summary, the processes that led to the extinction of other species of <em>Homo</em> are complex and likey interactive. Competetion among species is, in my view, well within the realm of possibility but would be extremely difficult (if not impossible) to test. Climate change is also a very likely contributing factor. There are several other hypotheses but I have tried to hit the major highlights.  The debate is certainly not settled.</p>

"What are chiasmata?","7263","","<p>I have a confusion in understanding what chiasmata are. My ‘NCERT’ book says ‘The beginning of diplotene is recognised by the dissolution of synaptonemal complex and the tendency of the recombined homologous chromosome of the bivalents to separate from each other except at the site of crossovers. These X shaped structures, are called chiasmata.’  </p>

<p>I am not able to imagine what chiasmata look like with this definition ‘... X shaped structures... ’ moreover I am not sure whether this definition is correct for whomsoever I have asked gave me somewhat different definition. </p>
","<p>We need to make a distinction between the genetic map of a chromosome, which is usually built up from meiotic recombination frequencies between linked genetic markers, the physical map of a chromosome, which used to be made up of clones and contigs, but is now usually derived from the reference genome sequence, and the cytological map of a chromosome, which is usually built from micrographs of fixed specimens.</p>

<p>In other words, you can only see chiasmata using a microscope.  They are named after the Greek letter named 'chi' which looks like our letter 'X', and are the cytological manifestation of the physical crossover, or crossing over, that took place after meiotic recombination, but before resolution.</p>

<p>Chiasmata are essential for proper segregation on the meiotic spindle because they provide the physical tension, or glue, that the microtubules pull against.  If the centromere of each replicated pair attaches to a different spindle pole, then as the microtubules pull, the chromosomes will align in the middle of the spindle.</p>

Is there just more variety among types of flu than other diseases, so that this year's vaccines don't cover next year's flu?</p>
","<p>The flu virus changes rapidly so that the current vaccine doesn't work against the new strains. </p>

<p>The way vaccines work is that they teach our immune system what to look out for. The vaccine contains bits of the virus but in a form that can't cause a proper infection, the body learns what to look for and next time before the virus can really get going the immune system kills it off first. </p>

<p>In the case of flu, every year it looks different enough that the targeting mechanisms of our body don't recognise it. Flu being a RNA virus frequently mutates until it is slightly different. This is called antigenic drift, the changing of the antigens or the parts our body recognises. </p>

<p>On top of that there's lots and lots of types of the influenza virus, that can not only infect humans but others which affect other animals. Occasionally the virus might combine with a random other strain making it completely new: an animal flu and human flu hybrid. These are the epidemics of swine or avian flu etc. This recombination is called antigenic shift.</p>

<p>So each year scientists predict which viruses will affect us this coming year and grow them ready for vaccines. Of course there's some of the old virus floating around looking for someone to infect, but those infected can't be infected by it again if the immune system is working. </p>

"Why is Fast Fourier Transform applied to raw EEG data?","7217","","<p>I am trying to understand <em>why</em> Fast Fourier Transform (<strong>FFT</strong>) is used in the analysis of raw EEG channel data.</p>

<p>My understanding (at the 30,000 ft view) is that FFT decomposes linear differential equations with non-sinusoidal source terms (which are fairly difficult to solve) and breaks them down into component equations (<em>with</em> sinusoidal source terms) that are easy to solve. It then combines each of these component/partial solutions to solve the original equation. In laymen's terms, it's like taking a smoothie, and breaking it down into its recipe of ingredients. Doing so would allow us to study and analyze each ingredient as it relates to the final product (the smoothie).</p>

What is to be gained by using FFT to break this voltage/time signal down into its constituent frequencies (alpha/beta/gamma/delta/mu waves), etc.? What additional information can each frequency tell us about the raw data?</p>

<hr>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Here is my updated understanding of how FFT relates to raw EEG data per @Mark's description below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcsPm.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcsPm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.dspguide.com/ch12/2.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fast-Fourier Transform</a> (FFT) transforms a signal from the time domain into the frequency domain. Basically, any time-dependent signal can be broken down in a collection of sinusoids. In this way, lengthy and noisy EEG recordings can be conveniently plotted in a frequency <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density#Power_spectral_density"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">power-spectrum</a>. By doing so, hidden features can become apparent. By adding all the sinusoids up after FFT, the original signal can be restored, so no information is lost. </p>

<p>A notable application of FFT in EEG is shown in Fig. 1, which shows an EEG in an awake person (top blue trace) and an EEG in a <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/propofol.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">propofol</a>-sedated person (bottom red trace). The traces are different, but exactly <em>how different</em>? Scientists like to <strong>quantify</strong> stuff. </p>

<p>Now look in Fig. 2, which shows the same data but filtered in the delta band (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">low-pass filtered</a> EEG with a <a href=""http://www.let.uu.nl/uilots/lab/courseware/phonetics/basics_of_acoustics_2/filters.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cut-off frequency</a> of 1.5 Hz, left panel). Here it already becomes more apparent what's going on, but what exactly <em>is</em> the difference between the two traces? That difference becomes readily apparent in the frequency domain by using FFT (Fig. 2, right panel); The frequency spectrum has a peak at 0.2 Hz in both traces, but that peak is about twice as big in the anesthetized state than in the normal state. In other words, the anesthetized brain reveals more low-frequency activity.</p>

<p>This is reminiscent of the drowsiness encountered in <a href=""http://www.nature.com/subjects/slow-wave-sleep"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">slow-wave sleep</a>; which is yet another example of why FFT is useful; various stages of sleep are markedly different in their EEG. For example, early stages of sleep are characterized by slow-wave EEG, while <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/sleep-101"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">REM sleep</a> is characterized by high-frequency EEG activity. By using FFT, these differences in frequency content can be captured in simple, quantifiable data.     </p>

<p>Another widely applied FFT-based application is <strong><a href=""http://www.eeginfo.com/research/researchpapers/signal_processing_techniques.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">filtering</a></strong> in the frequency domain. Look at the sleep EEG in Fig. 3. By splitting the raw signal up in frequency bands, the noise can be removed (high-frequency components), but even better, the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3157667/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">k-complex</a> (a characteristic hallmark of normal sleep) can be beautifully isolated from a messy EEG signal (bottom trace, 12-15 Hz).</p>

"Difference between viral and human genetic material","7177","","<p>I have heard that there is a difference between viral and human genetic material. What is that difference?</p>

<p>If I take my cells and take DNA out of them and insert only a small part of it having a sequence, say, AGTTC, and viral DNA with the same sequence, can my body distinguish between the two? If so, how?</p>
","<p>To sum up: If we are not talking about chromosome organization, nucleotide sequences and overall genome architecture (which are incomparably different in eukaryotes and [even their] viruses) the differences in the genetic material are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>viruses are much more diverse in their choice of genetic material, which is in the cornerstone of viral higher systematics. It can be DNA or RNA, single- or double-stranded, circular or linear. Animals, in turn, possess only double stranded DNA as their genetic material: linear dsDNA for the nuclear genome and [usually] circular dsDNA for the their mitochondrial genomes.</p></li>
<li><p>DNA termini pose a special problem for the maintenance of the molecule and show very unusual organization in terms of DNA sequence and structure. Repetitive terminal sequences of eukaryotic chromosomes have 3'-overhangs, which form a special quadruplex form of DNA. Termini of viruses are naturally much more diverse and are (nearly?) never of the same structure as in Eukaryotes. [Circularization/decicrularization is one of the mechanisms recruited by viruses]. (<a href=""http://www.frontiersin.org/Cancer_Molecular_Targets_and_Therapeutics/10.3389/fonc.2012.00201/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">Deng et al 2012</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>DNA methylation is normally present in varying degrees in animals and in vertebrates most of the cytosines in CpG dinucleotides are methylated. Viruses differ considerably from one another in this respect, but it seems that smaller viral genomes are generally under-methylated and larger genomes do not show under-methylation, although it depends on the stage. This conclusion is based partly on indirect evidence that CpG motifs are considerably much less frequent in smaller viruses. Integrated ""genetic parasites"" like retroviruses are normally rich in CpG and are highly methylated. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2396429/pdf/gkn121.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Hoelzer et al 2008</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>although I couldn't find relevant literature, I'd hypothesize that the highly packed genetic material in viral particles may potentially exist in more compact forms of the DNA helix (in dsDNA viruses). Most of the dsDNA in cells is present in a so-called B-form, but there are more compact A-form and less compact left-turned Z-form (there are other forms, most of which are biologically not relevant).

"What is the difference between second and third generation sequencing","7176","","<p>I am writing the section about history of DNA sequencing in the introduction chapter and after reading quite a few research papers, I am still confused about them. Here I compile some questions to make sure that I understand it correctly.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is second generation sequencing the same as next generation sequencing?</li>
<li>Is Sanger sequencing the first generation?</li>
<li>As of today, is there any commercial 3rd generation sequencing technology in use (or is it still in development)?</li>
</ol>

<p>If there is any paper reference that could explain all of the above then it would be really great.</p>
","<p>I'm assuming you mean DNA sequencing (excluding things like RNA-seq).</p>

<h2>Is Sanger sequencing the first generation?</h2>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19997069"" rel=""nofollow"">Metzker 2010</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The automated Sanger method is considered as a ""first-generation"" technology</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the technology that was in development when this review was written is no longer in development, but this is still an excellent review and a great place to start.</p>

<h2>Is second generation sequencing the same as next generation sequencing?</h2>

<p>Also from Metzker 2010:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and newer methods are referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ""newer methods"" in the review are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Emulsion PCR based like Roche/454</li>
<li>Solid phase amplification like Illumina/Solexa</li>
<li>Single molecule like Helicos BioSciences and Pacific Biosciences</li>
</ul>

<h2>As of today, is there any commercial 3rd generation sequencing technology in use (or is it still in development)?</h2>

<p>The development of single molecule methods (third item in the above list) has historically taken longer than the other two, so <a href=""http://genomena.com/technology-how-we-look-at-dna/third-generation-genome-sequencing/"" rel=""nofollow"">sometimes</a> they are <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166914000202"" rel=""nofollow"">referred to</a> as third generation. However, note how Metzker above considers them all ""next-gen"".</p>

<p>A recent <a href=""http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/R2/R227.short"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a> from PacBio itself makes the distinction of halting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second-generation sequencing (SGS): Sequencing of an ensemble of DNA molecules with wash-and-scan techniques. </p>
  
  <p>Third-generation sequencing (TGS): Sequencing single DNA molecules without the need to halt between read steps (whether enzymatic or otherwise). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, I think the ""generations"" are more useful to make the ""Sanger vs. Not Sanger"" distinction. Sanger sequencing is very different than next-gen in terms of what kind of experiment you can do and what sort of data you obtain.</p>

<p>Past that, the number of a generation is more of a marketing term. For instance, at the bottom of the PacBio paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conflict of Interest statement. All authors are employees of Pacific Biosciences and own stock in the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In practice, PacBio competes with second generation platforms. It is in their interest to say their technology is on ""another level"" compared to what's available on the market, but in practice, this is debatable.</p>

<p>Anyhow, to answer your question:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a technology in use and commercially available which has been referred to as third gen (PacBio)</li>
<li>There was a technology in development that falls under most definitions of third gen (Helicos), which went bankrupt in 2012</li>
<li>There is a technology in development (ON MinION) that is single-molecule based and was introduced after PacBio, so if PacBio is third generations, so is MinION (although the MinION is apparently very different from PacBio)</li>

"Determining net charge of amino acid at given pH","7163","","<p>I am trying to calculate the net charge on an amino acid, but I seem to be doing it wrong. The question I am trying to answer is ""In a pH 7.0 buffer, what will be the charge of Methionine?"" We are referred to a table that gives us the following information:</p>

<p>pKa1 (COOH) = 2.28</p>

<p>pKa2 (NH3+) = 9.21</p>

<p>pI = 5.74</p>

<p>From what I understand, if pH > pI, (which it is here), the amino acid should have a negative charge because even though the pH is high enough to deprotonate all the carboxyl ends and not enough to deprotonate all the amino ends, since it is higher than the pI <em>some of the amino ends have been deprotonated</em> (in addition to all the carboxyl ends). </p>

<p>Yet my answer book says that the net charge would be zero! Are 5.74 and 7.0 ""close enough"" that we can consider net charge to be zero still? If so, what is the standard permissible 'fuzzy' range? If not, then what is going on here?   </p>
","<p>You are right in your reasoning: at any pH for any titratable group, there is a distribution between the protonated and deprotonated species. We can calculate this distribution and therefore the average charge of the species with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson%E2%80%93Hasselbalch_equation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Henderson-Hasselbalch equation</a>:</p>

<p>$$\mathrm{pH = pKa + log\left(\frac{[B]}{[A]}\right)}$$</p>

<p>Or, rearranged:</p>

<p>$$\mathrm{\frac{[B]}{[A]} = 10^{pH - pKa}}$$</p>

<p>Where A is the conjugate acid and B is the conjugate base. For carboxyls and primary amines, this can also be written as $\ce{\frac{[COO-]}{[COOH]}}$ and $\ce{\frac{[NH2]}{[NH3+]}}$, respectively. As a simple example, if the pH was 2.28, the ratio between the protonated and deprotonated form of the carboxyl group (pKa = 2.28) would be $\ce{\frac{COO-}{COOH} = 10^0 = 1}$. This means $\ce{[COO-] = [COOH]}$ and the average charge of the carboxyl is thus -0.5.</p>

<p>Now, for cases where $\mathrm{pH \neq pKa}$, we need to determine the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_fraction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mole fraction</a>, $\chi$, for each charged species. Given that $\mathrm{\frac{[B]}{[A]} = \frac{\chi_B}{\chi_A}}$ and $\ce{\chi_A + \chi_B = 1}$, we can derive these equations:</p>

<p>$$\mathrm{\chi_{COO^-} = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{pKa - pH}}}$$
$$\mathrm{\chi_{NH_3^+} = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pKa}}}$$</p>

<p>Plugging in the numbers, we get:</p>

<p>$$\mathrm{\chi_{COO^-} \approx 0.999981}$$</p>

<p>$$\mathrm{\chi_{NH_3^+} \approx 0.993872}$$</p>

<p>To state it another way, ~99.9981% of the carboxyl groups are in the deprotonated (negative) state and ~99.3872% of the amino groups are in the protonated (positive) state. The average charge of methionine at pH 7 is simply the sum of these mole fractions, accounting for the charge of each species, and is approximately equal to -0.006109. I assume your textbook is rounding.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can plot these functions to see how charge varies with pH:</p>

"Why would taking antibiotics increase stamina and energy?","7159","","<p>I often hear that people who are taking antibiotics experience wild fluctuations between feeling full of energy and completely alert but soon after feeling impossibly fatigued and sick.</p>

<p>Does this have anything to do with the antibiotics being used by the body as anything? For example as a hormone or as a source of nutrition?  Is this this a reported side effect when used for other infections?</p>
","<p>I have never heard about this phenomenon from my patients or professors at the Medical School, but this is a possible mechanism that comes to my mind.</p>

<p>One of the classification for antibiotics takes consideration the effect on bacteria. Two possible effects are either <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriostatic"">stopping the proliferation</a> (and letting the immune system to kill those that are currently present in the body) or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactericide#Bactericidal_antibiotics"">killing bacteria directly</a>.</p>

<p>The second approach is obviously more effective but has one big disadvantage: massive death of bacteria leads to the massive release of their toxins that are normally trapped within they bodies (so-called endotoxins). The symptoms you describe as ""impossible fatigue"" match exactly the symptoms of bacterial intoxication -- and this can increase upon the antibiotics intake.</p>

<p>Depending upon the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics some antibiotics might not kill all bacteria ""on the first run"" and the symptoms of intoxication recur several times with decreasing severity of manifestations.  </p>

"What is the maximum number of babies a human woman can have?","7151","","<p>I know you could divide the female fertility period (~40 years, right?) by 9 months which would give something like ~50 kids (with no multiple kids per pregnancy). The limiting factor in this calculation is time but is there a biological upper limit as well?</p>
","<p><strong>How do you define the biological limit?</strong></p>

<p>It very much depends on how you define a biological limit. If you prefer, it very much depends on how you define a human! Some women are completely sterile while others are highly fertile and there is genetic predisposition to that.  How much ""perfect"" should the genotype of an individual be so that it is still considered as a human? There is genetic variance underlying fecundity that is important to consider. For example, in your calculation you took lifespan as a constant but it obviously is not a constant. Fecundity is reduced by all these small mutations segregating in the human populations that reduce the fecundity of any single human. There exist no human that is free from all deleterious alleles. Imagine a giant woman with 10 independent reproductive system! Would she still be a human? That was probably kind of a too extreme thought experiment. Imagine a woman that can have a reproductive lifespan of 100 years. Would it still be a human? The issue behind this question reminds me an old post (now closed, I can't find it anymore) that asked whether a leopard would run faster if it had more legs. Well... one can imagine something running faster than a leopard, but it would not be a leopard anymore. So how many changes from a leopard are we allowed to make to answer the question. So I had to chose a definition of what a ""perfect woman"" is. Or a definition of a woman that would set this so called biological limit.</p>

<p><em>The definition I am using to answer this question</em></p>

<p>In the below answer, I will assume that by biological limit you mean the expected fitness of a female that would live in the same environment than we live in today but would not carry any single of the deleterious locus that are segregating in the human population. In other words I assume that you accept that the ""perfect woman"", that is a woman that would not carry any single of the deleterious mutations that segregate in the populations will set this biological limit to woman maximal fecundity.</p>

<p><strong>Mutation load Theory</strong></p>

<p>The decrease in the mean fitness of an idealized population where no deleterious mutations would exist compared to the realized mean fitness of a population is called the mutation load. The mutation (in an infinite population) is a function of the genome-wide mutation rate only. Let the genome-wide mutation rate in human be $U=2.2$, the mutation load $L$ in the human population is equal to $L=1-e^{-2.2}=0.89$. The estimates are taken from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jctvV5xrWw4&amp;spfreload=10"" rel=""nofollow"">this video</a>. You may want to have a look to the video in order to have a better understanding of why $L=1-e^{-U}$ and what are the assumptions of these calculations. The main assumptions are 1) infinite population size, 2) multiplicity of fitness effects at different loci and 3) additivity of fitness effect between alleles at the same locus.</p>

<p><strong>So what does mutation load theory predicts?</strong></p>

<p>The above calculation means that segregating deleterious allele reduce the fitness of the average woman by 89%! If we assume that an average woman can have 10 babies (this number is just a random guess) if she wants to, then the maximum biological limit of a ""perfect woman"" (in a world where there is no more competition than the one in which we are living) is $\frac{10}{1-0.89}≈91$  babies!</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_with_the_most_children"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia</a>, the world record is 69 and is owned by Mrs. Vassilyev. It is reasuring to see that the observed world record (69) is lower than the the biological limit we just calculated (91). If we were to know the distribution of maximal number of babies per woman (not to be confused with the realized number of babies), we could calculate the probability to have 69 or more babies and compare this probability to the total number of females that has ever lived (or the total number of females that would have never had the idea to have so many babies). Always according to wikipedia, the world record for men would be 867 and is owned by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Ibn_Sharif"" rel=""nofollow"">Ismail Ibn Sharif</a>. However, sounds possible to me (but I really have no idea) that some sperm donor may have overshoot this number today.</p>

"Does muscle get bigger by increase in size of individual cells or increase in number?","7148","","<p>Somewhere in the back of my mind, I have the claim that a muscle never increases its amount of cells but, if the muscle gets bigger, it's simply because individual cells get bigger.</p>

<p>The book Anatomy Trains on page 36 cites ""Changes in sarcomere length and physiological properties in immobilized muscle by  Williams et al"" when it makes the claim : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stretched, a muscle will attempt to recoil back to its 
  resting length before giving up and adding more cells 
  and sarcomeres to bridge the gap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that true? Do muscles increase the number of their cells in that way?</p>
","<p>The ""back of your mind"" is correct: <em>""if the muscle gets bigger, it's simply because individual cells get bigger.""</em></p>

<p>Growth of muscle can occur in three ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>by an increase in muscle cell numbers</li>
<li>by an increase in muscle fiber diameter</li>
<li>by an increase in fiber length. </li>
</ul>

<p>However, growth in <em>cell numbers</em> is <strong>limited to the prenatal and immediately postnatal period, with the animals and man being born with or soon reaching their full complement of muscle cells.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[G]rowth occurs by either hypertrophy of the existing muscle fibers by adding additional myofibrils to increase the muscle mass or by adding new sarcomeres to the ends of the existing muscle fibers to increase their length. Both of these mechanisms occur during the growth process. Growth in the girth of the muscle fibers... may be stimulated by development of stress creating an unequal pressure with splitting at the Z-band and development of additional SR and T-tubule systems. This adds to the diameter or girth of myofibers without any hyperplasia. The growth in length occurs at either end of the fibers and results in addition of new sarcomeres. In both cases, new myofibrillar protein must be synthesized and deposited in the muscle cells. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adding or removing sarcomeres and myofibrils is determined by exercise, that is, the degree of force a muscle can generate which is in turn dependent on the degree of overlap of the thick and thin filaments. Thus, the amount of tension would control the number of in-series sarcomeres and the number of myofibrils in a single muscle fiber. </p>

<p>Nutrition is also known to play an important role in muscle growth, but growth (that is, increase in girth) cannot occur without exercise. </p>

<p>The exact roles of GF and IGF-I are not completely clear.</p>

<p>Muscle size does not increase by the addition of new muscle cells:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The results show that the <em>increase in muscle cross-sectional area from childhood to adult age is caused by an increase in mean fiber size.</em> This is accompanied by a functional development of the fiber population: the proportion of type 2 fibers increases significantly from the age of 5 (approx. 35%) to the age of 20 (approx. 50%), which, <strong>in the absence of any discernible effect on the total number of fibers</strong>, is most likely caused by a transformation of type 1 to type 2 fibers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Activation of satellite cells</em>, a claim made by body builders, is mis-represented by them. The <em>satellite cells</em> seem only to <em>aid</em> severely damaged muscle cells to heal, not to increase in number.</p>

"Why does it hurt the next day after doing significant exercise?","7121","","<p>I think this is a fairly common observation that if one does some significant amount of exercise, he/she may feel alright for the rest of the day, but it  generally hurts bad <em>the next day</em>. Why is this the case?</p>

<p>I would expect that if the muscles have undergone significant strain (say I started pushups/plank today), then it should cause pain while doing the strenuous activity, or during rest of the day, but it happens often that we don't feel the pain while doing the activity or even on that day, but surely and sorely feel it the next day.</p>

<p>Another example - say after a long time, you played a long game of basketball/baseball/cricket. You generally don't feel any pain during the game/that day, but there is a good chance it will hurt bad the next day.</p>

<p>I am trying to understand both - why does the pain not happen on that day, and why it does, the next day (or the day after that).</p>
","<p>Unlike the conventional wisdom, the pain you feel the next day (after a strenuous exercise) has <strong>nothing</strong> to do with lactic acid. </p>

<p>Actually, lactic acid is rapidly removed from the muscle cell and converted to other substances in the liver (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_cycle"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cori cycle</a>). If you start to feel your muscles ""burning"" during exercise (due to lactic acid), you just need to rest for some seconds, and the ""burning"" sensation disappears.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-lactic-acid-buil/#"" rel=""noreferrer"">Scientific American</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrary to popular opinion, lactate or, as it is often called, lactic acid buildup <strong>is not responsible</strong> for the muscle soreness felt in the days following strenuous exercise. Rather, the production of lactate and other metabolites during extreme exertion results in the burning sensation often felt in active muscles. Researchers who have examined lactate levels right after exercise found little correlation with the level of muscle soreness felt a few days later. (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if it's not lactic acid, what is the cause of the pain?</p>

<p>What you're feeling in the next day is called <strong>Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness</strong>
 (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness"" rel=""noreferrer"">DOMS</a>).</p>

<p>DOMS is basically an inflammatory process (with accumulation of histamine and prostaglandins), due to microtrauma or micro ruptures in the muscle fibers. The soreness can last from some hours to a couple of days or more, depending on the severity of the trauma (see below).</p>

<p>According to the ""damage hypothesis"" (also known as ""micro tear model""), microruptures are necessary for hypertrophy (if you are working out seeking hypertrophy), and that explains why lifting very little weight doesn't promote hypertrophy.</p>

<p>However, this same microtrauma promotes an inflammatory reaction (Tiidus, 2008). This inflammation can take some time to develop (that's why you normally feel the soreness the <em>next day</em>) and, like a regular inflammation, has as signs pain, edema and heat. </p>

<p>This figure from McArdle (2010) shows the proposed sequence for DOMS:</p>

<p>As anyone who works out at the gym knows, deciding how much weight to add to the barbell can be complicated: too little weight promotes no microtrauma, and you won't have any hypertrophy. Too much weight leads to too much microtraumata, and you'll have trouble to get out of the bed the next day. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: This <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/61020/why-does-it-hurt-the-next-day-after-doing-significant-exercise/61025#comment111799_61025"">comment</a> asks if there is evidence of the ""micro tear model"" or ""damage model"" (also EIMD, or Exercise-induced muscle damage). First, that's precisely why I was careful when I used the term <em>hypothesis</em>. Second, despite the matter not being settled, there is indeed evidence supporting EIMD. This meta-analysis (Schoenfeld, 2012) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a sound theoretical rationale supporting a potential role for EIMD in the hypertrophic response. Although it appears that muscle growth can occur in the relative absence of muscle damage, potential mechanisms exist whereby EIMD may enhance the accretion of muscle proteins including the release of inflammatory agents, activation of satellite cells, and upregulation of IGF-1 system, or at least set in motion the signaling pathways that lead to hypertrophy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same paper, however, discuss the problems of EIMD and a few alternative hypotheses (some of them not mutually exclusive, though).</p>

<p>Shortly speaking: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">REM</a> (Rapid Eye Movement) is one phase of sleep. During this phase we dream and some of our <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">neurotransmitter</a> are shut off. This include <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">norepinephrine</a>, which is involved in controlling erection. Norepinephrine prevents blood to enter the penis (preventing the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">erection</a>). In absence of norepinephrine (during REM phase norepinephrine is absent) blood enters the penis yielding to an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">erection</a>. This phenomenon is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_penile_tumescence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nocturnal penile tumescence</a>. Such erections typically occurs 3 to 5 times a night. A related question on the concern of women erections can be found <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19915/what-get-women-instead-of-morning-wood"">here</a>.</p>

<p>A high pressure in the bladder may also lead to a ""reflex erection"". This erection allows to prevent uncontrolled urination. The drawback is that when, in the morning one has an erection and can't wait to pee it might get hard to accurately target the toilets!</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1et5NgT6bQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This video</a> is also a nice and easy source of information on the subject.</p>

<p><strong>Is it bad?</strong></p>

<p>(<em>Reading my ""note"" below, you have edited your post to get rid of this question, thank you</em>)</p>

<p>It is perfectly healthy you don't have to worry about that. These erections are even thought as contributing to penile health. At the opposite, the absence of erections during the night are an index of Erectile Dysfunction (E.D.).</p>

"Why do tattoos persist if body cells are regularly renewed?","7075","","<p>I am not quite sure if it is true, but I read somewhere that within 7 years all the body's cells are replaced with new ones. I am not quite sure if it is cells or atoms.</p>

<p>If it is then why do tattoos persist for so long? If the cells which were impregnated with the dye have been replaced, then why do the tattoos still remain?</p>
","<p>First, tattoo pigment isn't injected into cells. If you were to puncture a cell with something the size of a tattoo needle, it would die - full stop. Many cells are destroyed in the process though, mostly by tearing, which initiates the wound healing process.</p>

<p>So what actually happens is the particles lodge in between the cells of the dermis (the layer below the epidermis, or outer layer of skin) and new cells crowd around it as damaged cells are replaced.</p>

<p>Since the particles in good tattoo ink are too big to be carried off by macrophages, they just sit there. That doesn't stop them from trying, though. Macrophages take up the pigment but are unable to escape with their garbage. Fibroblasts envelope the particles, both intracellularly and within the extracellular matrix they generate. At the end of a fibroblast's life, its contents are taken up by the same process - still too big to remove.</p>

<p>Smaller particles will be carried off by macrophages capable of both consuming the particles <em>and</em> migrating into the lyphatic system, which is why some ink fades more than other kinds. Ink composed of fine particles would be expected to fade severely. New tattoos are also sharper because some of the ink that was injected is lodged in the epidermis, which is the layer that grows <em>out</em> and is shed over time.</p>

<p>In this biopsy of a tattooed mouse, you can see how the epidermis has carried some of the pigment <em>out</em> of the skin while much of the dermal layer's pigment has been either removed lymphatically or enveloped:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KmzFO.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KmzFO.png"" alt=""Mouse tattoo biopsy""></a></p>

<p>Thus, over time the pigment will be moved around a bit by this cellular activity, in fact <em>deeper</em> into the dermal layer on the whole.</p>

<p>The intent of using laser light to remove tattoos is to break those particles down into smaller pieces burst any cells containing them - again initiating the wound healing process. However, unlike in previous cases, when macrophages reach the site they can now sweep the remaining particles away to the lymph nodes.</p>

"Bacterial capsule vs. slime wall","7046","","<p>I've read that the bacterial capsule protects the bacterium from phagocytes and prevents water (and nutrients, possibly?) leakage from the bacterium.</p>

<p>A less organized and less dense version is called a slime layer. It seems that the slime layer has similar functions, according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_layer"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>What are the differences between the effects a capsule and a slime layer bring to a bacterium?</p>

<p>I thought about the followings:</p>

<ul>
<li>The capsule covers most part of the bacterium, so adhesion proteins and transport proteins on the plasma membrane do not work effectively, whereäs with a slime layer, more proteins on the plasma membrane are exposed to the exterior, making them work more effectively.</li>
<li>Maintenance of the capsule takes more energy than that of the slime layer simply because there are more glycoproteins in the capsule.</li>
<li>Bacteria with capsules are less likely to lyse than those with slime layers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there anything else significant that goes on this list? Or are there any points I made that are not true?</p>
","<p>According to the Wikipedia section on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"" rel=""nofollow"">bacterial capsules</a>, they're made of the same thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the amorphous viscid secretion (that makes up the capsule) diffuses into the surrounding medium and remains as a loose undemarcated secretion, it is known as slime layer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/structure_4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology</a> synonymizes ""slime layer"" and ""biofilm"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A true capsule is a discrete detectable layer of polysaccharides deposited outside the cell wall. A less discrete structure or matrix which embeds the cells is a called a slime layer or a biofilm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes sense with what I remember learning about slime walls--the main difference I saw was that the capsule was directly associated with/only protects a single bacterial cell, whereas the slime layer is associated with/protects multiple bacteria. I'm not sure that I'd call it a biofilm though, as those are notoriously difficult to remove; their removal in hospital and food processing sysyems is a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20198521"" rel=""nofollow"">current research topic</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding your three points above, I might instead argue that the slime layer provides another layer of protection in addition to the bacterial capsule.</p>

","<p>Diploid organisms, such as we are, generally have two copies of each gene (excepting the sex chromosomes in males).  In order to display the genotype for each, geneticists use shorthand.  When referring to a gene, + means the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"">wildtype</a>, which is the ""normal"" version, and - means that the gene is missing, often a knockout.  So a typical individual's genome for a particular gene will be +/+, a hemizygote (one copy deleted) is +/-, and a complete knockout is -/-.</p>

<p>According to a textbook, the two with the same genus are more closely related, but I do not understand why?</p>
","<p>Two different species can have the same species epithet if they belong to different genera (<em>'species name</em>' is referring to the full binomial name).

<p>Two species can be have the same genus name (meaning they belong to the same genus) and will therefore necessarily have different species epithets (otherwise we would name them exactly the same way which would be very confusing).

<p>As a consequence, if two species share the same species epithet then it tells you nothing about how closely related they are. If they share the same genus name, then they belong to the same genus (except exceptions probably!).</p>

<p>For the above examples, the term <em>glabra</em> comes from <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/glaber"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""glaber"" (latin)</a> which means <em>""Hairless""</em>.

","<p>In RNA sequencing, the RNA is fragmented, DNA is synthesized complementary to the RNA fragments, which is  followed by a complementary strand synthesis. Fragmentation can be done after the cDNA synthesis too. 
This DNA is then amplified to form a cluster that is sequenced. Most Next-Gen sequencing approaches sequence a short segment of the DNA (it has improved with experimental and technical optimization).</p>

<p>A read refers to the sequence of a cluster that is obtained after the end of the sequencing process which is ultimately the sequence of a section of a unique fragment. If an RNA is expressed in high copies then there will be more reads coming from it; reads can be redundant as well.

"Why can action potentials not be initiated at dendrites?","6971","","<p>Why are action potentials not initiated at dendrites, although dendrites are the first to receive input from the presynaptic cell?</p>

<p>In fact, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) at the dendrites are smaller than in the cell body and axon.</p>

<p>Considering the fact that dendrites have enough voltage gated ion channels, why is it that cation influx through these channels is not able to depolarize the dendrite above threshold and generate an action potential?</p>
","<p>The exact site of action potential generation is debated, as is the underlying physiological mechanism <a href=""http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8824308"" rel=""nofollow"">(Colbert &amp; Johnsten, 1996)</a>. It is generally agreed upon that the initiation site is beyond the soma, at the axon hillock, or even further in the initial segment of the axon. </p>

<p>The reason for the distal axonal initiation site of action potentials is, according to the classical view, that the <strong>density of Na<sup>+</sup> channels is not high enough in the soma</strong>, while the density in the axon initial segment is substantially higher and sufficient. However, it has also been proposed that the <strong>threshold of action potential generation</strong> is lower at the initial segment <a href=""http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v11/n2/abs/nn2040.html"" rel=""nofollow"">(Kole et al., 2008)</a>. </p>

<p>Regarding your questions in the comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>So can't action potentials be initiated at dendrites and soma with the help of VGCCs?</code> 
<strong>Answer</strong>: No. Channel density is too low; </li>
<li><code>What are the channels required for AP?</code><br>
<strong>Answer</strong>: Basically Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels;</li>
<li><code>How is it that action potentials are initiated at axon hillock, although the input is at dendrites? Why can't enough depolarization happen at dendrites and soma?</code><br>
<strong>Answer</strong>: Either due to a low density of Na<sup>+</sup> channels, and/or a higher action potential threshold (e.g., due to the presence of K<sup>+</sup> channels in the soma counteraction depolarization);</li>
<li><code>As a corollary,if enough depolarization cannot occur at dendrites and soma,how then is it propagated to the axon, which is further down anatomically , in the neuron?</code><br>
<strong>Answer</strong>: If the EPSP reaches a region with sufficient Na<sup>+</sup> channels, depolarization becomes sufficient to activate a critical amount of Na<sup>+</sup> channels that causes a sufficient increase in the membrane potential to sustain a full-blown action potential. Along the way, leaky K<sup>+</sup> channels decrease the depolarization so a critical amount of channels is necessary, otherwise the EPSP dies out. </li>
<li><code>What about backpropagating APs from axon hillock to dendrites ? How is that possible?</code><br>
<strong>Answer</strong>: the soma and dendritic region are believed to represent too big an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_load"" rel=""nofollow"">electrical load</a> to ensure action potential propagation in both the orthodromic and the antidromic direction. This <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_matching"" rel=""nofollow"">impedance mismatch</a> can be overcome for an action potential propagating from the axon back into the somato-dendritic region when the initial segment and axon hillock provide additional current.

<p>Color and structure of iris is greatly depended upon genetic links, but the patterns are not. Iris is developed by the prenatal(before birth) growth through a process of tight forming and folding of the tissue membrane.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The human iris begins to form during the third month of gestation. The structures creating its distinctive pattern are complete by the eighth month of gestation, but pigmentation continues into the first years after birth. The layers of the iris have both ectodermal and mesodermal embryological origin, consisting of (from back to front): a darkly pigmented epithelium; pupillary dilator and sphincter muscles; heavily vascularized stroma (connective tissue of interlacing ligaments containing melanocytes); and an anterior layer of chromataphores and melanocytes with a genetically determined density of melanin pigment granules. The combined effect is a visible pattern displaying various distinctive features such as arching ligaments, crypts, furrows, ridges, and a zigzag collarette. Iris colour is determined mainly by the density of the stroma and its melanin content, with blue irises resulting from an absence of pigment: longer wavelengths differentially penetrate while shorter wavelengths are reflected and scattered, a phenomenon resembling that which makes the sky blue. The heritability and ethnographic diversity of iris colour have long been studied, but until the present research, little attention had been paid to the achromatic pattern complexity and textural variability of the iris among individuals. </p>

<p><strong>Iris Recognition vs. Retina Scanning</strong> </p>

<p>Iris and retinal scanning are ocular based biometric identifiers. Iris recognition uses a camera to capture image of the iris. Iris is the only internal organ visible from outside the body. Iris scanners can acquire an image of the eye from a distance of 3 to 10 inches.
In retinal scanning, the device send a beam of light deep inside the eye to capture the image of retina, which is located on the back of the eye. retinal scanning is not widely used due to the intrusive methods used to capture the image.</p>

<p>But what physiological (adaptive?) process leads to increased alcohol tolerance over the long term in a single individual?</p>
","<p>The subject of alcohol tolerance is broader than it might appear. However, in most cases people refer to what is called metabolic alcohol tolerance. Based on your response to the comment made by Alexander Galkin, I assume that you also refer to metabolic alcohol tolerance.</p>

<p>Metabolic alcohol tolerance is the result of drinking significant amounts of alcohol over a period of time as you describe. Both the amount of alcohol and the duration that it takes to develop an increased metabolic tolerance towards alcohol differ from person to person.</p>

<p>When most people drink alcohol, the liver will responds by activating alcohol degrading enzymes that break down the alcohol molecules, which results in the elimination of the intoxicating effect. The activation of those enzymes occurs much faster with people who have developed metabolic alcohol tolerance and the concentration of those enzymes is generally higher. This means that those people can break down alcohol faster than you and me, that is, they can ""tolerate"" more alcohol in the sense that they simply get rid of it much quicker.</p>

<p>On a final note, being more alcohol tolerant is not exactly correct as metabolic tolerance doesn't necessarily mean that the organs affected/intoxicated (such as the brain) by alcohol aren't necessarily more tolerant. The alcohol is simply broken down much faster and can therefore have a limited impact.</p>

  <p>After some moment of being rude, selfish, or weak, either we are able to put it behind us, or the person who suffered at the result of our imperfection moves on. The reason for this is our ability to forget about it. We forget not because we have an imperfect hippocampus (our brain’s memory organ); it's actually an evolved solution. The ability to lose information allows new information to come in that is more relevant, more pertinent to an ongoing reality. Forgetting allows us to update.</p>

","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
It has been shown that loss of long-term memories may enhance the retrieval of others. Short-term working memory is explicitly designed to be volatile and non-lasting. However, there are many other types of memories where memory loss may not be explicitly beneficial, or even outright debilitating such as in the case of Alzheimer's or stroke.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
First off all, there are many types of <a href=""http://www.human-memory.net/types.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">memories</a>, including sensory memory, motor memory, short-term (working) memory, long-term memory, explicit &amp; implicit memory, declarative &amp; procedural memory and so on. Hence, because the question is quite broad, I will focus on long-term memory, short term-memory and sensory memory to discuss that memory loss can be beneficial, neutral, or detrimental.  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beneficial effects of loosing memories</strong><br>
<a href=""http://www.human-memory.net/types.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Long-term memory</strong></a> is probably what you are after and there are studies in that field that have linked the loss of memories to enhanced processing of other memories. More specifically, there are adaptive benefits of forgetting, namely a reduced demand on cognitive controls during future acts of remembering of other stored information. Even more specific: retrieval of memories after forgetting others are thought to reduce the necessary engagement of functionally coupled cognitive control mechanisms that <strong>detect</strong> (<em>anterior cingulate</em> cortex) and <strong>resolve</strong> (<em>dorsolateral</em> and <em>ventrolateral prefrontal cortex</em>) mnemonic competition <a href=""http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n7/abs/nn1918.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Kuhl <em>et al</em>., 2007)</a>. The improvement of particular memory processes by forgetting others may be linked to them being closely related. Indeed, motor tasks more remote do not benefit much from forgetting unrelated ones <a href=""http://shapeamerica.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02701367.1991.10608726"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Shea &amp; Right, 1991)</a>.   </li>
<li><strong>Inherently volatile memory</strong><br>
<strong><a href=""http://www.human-memory.net/types_short.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Short-term working memory</a></strong> is explicitly designed to aid in on-demand task performance. Short term memory is for example used to remember a set of components (e.g., colors) and use that information to deal with a certain task at hand (<em>which objects depicted here match the colors you just saw?</em>). If all these memories would be retained, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3721021/"" rel=""noreferrer"">tasks dependent on working memory</a> would not be possible. <a href=""http://www.human-memory.net/types_sensory.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sensory memory</a> an ultra-short term memory that is kept only for very short amounts of time, allowing people to, <em>e.g.</em>, track a light and make a symbol or letter out of it before the information is funneled to the short term-memory. </li>
<li><strong>Neutral effects of loss of neural function: a side track off memory lane</strong><br>
However, forgetting may be simply another example of the <strong><em><a href=""http://hearinghealthfoundation.org/blog?blogid=119"" rel=""noreferrer"">use it or lose it</a></em></strong> principle that applies to pretty much everything in the human body; when you don't walk, the bones in the legs will weaken along with the musculature used for locomotion. Similarly, when the inner ear or the retina becomes dysfunctional and degenerate, the deafferented auditory nerve and optic nerve start to degenerate, respectively. The associated deafferented sensory cortices will slowly be taken over by other adjacent cortical areas due to the <strong>plasticity of the cortex</strong>. In blind folks, for example, the tactile and auditory cortices have been shown to take over the primary visual cortex. Given that the visual cortex is huge compared to the tactile and auditory cortex, one would expect substantial increase in performance on tactile and acoustic tasks in blind folks. Yet, this is debated <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899315005156"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Stronks et al, 2015)</a>. In fact, normally sighted folks can learn braille as well as their blind peers, suffice they get an equal amount of practice. In other words, practice is the key, not enhanced areas of cortex being available <em>per se</em>. Hence, <strong>'forgetting' to see or 'forgetting' to hear is, as far as my knowledge goes, not associated with any benefits whatsoever</strong>, barred a minority of studies that showed a slight benefit of being blind in auditory tasks <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899315005156"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Stronks et al., 2015)</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Pathological memory loss - not so good</strong>:<br>
However, forgetting of memories may also be pathological; think of the impaired short-term memory of <a href=""http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_what_is_alzheimers.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Alzheimer's</a> patients, or <a href=""http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/social-security-disability-benefits-and-memory-loss.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">amnesia due to stroke</a>.

<li>Exactly what C Rags mentioned-- to increase the size of the vein. This position utilizes the force of gravity to pool blood towards the head from the lower extremities. This makes the vein of interest easier to visualize compared to surrounding structures, to palpate since this increases pressure within the vein, and to ultimately puncture. </li>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Breasts of human females are large compared to those of closely related primate species,
  and they can thus be hypothesized recently or currently to have been subject to directional
  sexual selection. Here we show that (1) large breasts have higher levels of fluctuating
  asymmetry than small breasts, (2) breast fluctuating asymmetry is higher in women without
  children than in women with at least one child, (3) breast fluctuating symmetry is
  a reliable predictor of age-independent fecundity, and (4) breast fluctuating symmetry
  appears to be associated with sexual selection. These conclusions were similar in studies
  from two cultures differing in fecundity and brenstfeeding traditions (Spain; New Mexico,
  U.S.A.). Choosy males that prefer females with symmetrical breasts may experience a
  direct fitness benefit in terms of increased fecundity and an indirect benefit in terms of
  attractive or fecund daughters. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some quotes from the text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The size of breasts in human females is large compared to that of other primate
  species, and there has thus been a recent evolutionary change in breast size.
  Human breasts are characterized by their large size and rapid development prior
  to and during puberty, when growth of other body parts also reaches a high level.
  They can thus be considered costly structures in terms of energy use. …
  Heavy investment in breast development during puberty may seem puzzling
  because the functional significance of breasts is far from obvious. There is no
  or little relationship between breast size and production and composition of milk
  in current industrial societies (reviews in Anderson 1983; Cant 1981; Low et al.
  1987), and breasts have therefore been hypothesized to constitute a deceptive signal
  used by women to attract preferred mates (Low et al. 1987). In prehistoric
  human populations, conditions may have been different, when mother's milk
  was the sole source of nutrition for young children and when resources often
  may have been more limited than in present industrial societies. In this study
  we show that large breasts tend to be more asymmetric than small breasts. In
  prehistoric societies, where resources were likely to be less available or more unevenly
  distributed among women, breast asymmetries are likely to have been much
  larger than in present industrial societies with relatively easy access to resources. …</p>
  
  <p>If the relationship between breast size and fluctuating
  asymmetry is robust, we hypothesize that a directional preference for large, symmetrical
  breasts, as apparently found in some cultures (Ellis 1954), can be maintained
  in the population because selection for large breasts will be balanced by
  selection against asymmetrical breasts</p>
  
  <p>We also show that breast symmetry is a reliable predictor of age-independent
  fecundity, and that choosy males that use breast symmetry as a cue in their mate
  choice will experience an advantage in terms of reproductive success. Breast symmetry
  can thus be considered a reliable signal used in intersexual communication.</p>

","<p>First, remember that identical twins actually have the same genotype. So its not exactly true that everyone has a unique genome.</p>

<p>But to get at the heart of it, you're asking how I can be sure that I have a different genome than you, or even than say my brother. And moreover you're asking how these differences are obvious enough that they can be detected <em>without</em> whole genome sequencing.</p>

<p>The answer is that there is no mechanism to ensure differences, but that the differences arise from the enormous variability of our genome. Look at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"" rel=""nofollow"">major histocompatibility complex</a>, or <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27156/"" rel=""nofollow"">MHC</a>, a cluster of genes that affect our immune system.</p>

<p>Just to simplify things, lets focus in on four genes in this cluster: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRB1. According to <a href=""http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/stats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this site</a> there are 2579, 3285, 2133 and 1411 alleles for each, respectively. If we make a naive assumption that each of us received a random assortment of these genes, that makes 2579 x 3285 x 2133 x 1411 = 25,549,791,000,000 possible combinations. The chance that we both have the same combination is then about 1 in 25 trillion, just considering 4 genes.</p>

<p>But wait, you say, surely some of these genes are not equally likely and surely they segregate together, making this chance much smaller. You would be right. But this consideration stops mattering very much when you account for the rest of the variable regions. They combine multiplicatively, so considering a fifth gene with only 2 possible alleles brings the possible combinations to 50 trillion.</p>

<p>If you consider just a few more genes, the numbers get unthinkably high. This pretty much ensures that, even considering a small sequence, we can be sure that the genetic fingerprint is unique.</p>

The activation kinetics of Na<sup>+</sup> channels are faster than K<sup>+</sup> channels. </p>

<p>After opening, the channel is inactivated, which can occurs through a physical ""<a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7303/edsumm/e100708-02.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">protein-plug</a>"" as shown in Fig. 1, or through <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7303/edsumm/e100708-02.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">conformational changes</a> in the pore. This inactivation again is fast in Na<sup>+</sup> channels leading to a transient spike in the action potential, and deactivation is slower for K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sup>+</sup> channels do not inactivate, but rather deactivate). This inactivation step results in the refractory period of a neuron (silent period after firing). The channel is then de-inactivated and converted to the closed state, after which the channel is again ready to participate in another round of firing.     </p>

"Is there an advantage to linear chromosomes?","6798","","<p>The DNA copying enzymes have a hard time working to the end of a chromosome. For circular chromosomes this is not a problem, since there is not a sharp 'end'. However, for a linear chromosome, without extra mechanisms in place, a bit of DNA is lost off the end of the chromosome after each replication. Because of this, eukaryotes have a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">telomere</a> to cap off their chromosomes. </p>

<p>In most cells of a mutli-cellular organism, this telomere is slowly worn away after each reproduction leading to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apoptosis</a>. Cells that need to reproduce indefinitely such as germ and stem cells have to invest in extra mechanisms to replenish the telomere. For multi-cellular eukaryotes I can see how this might be usefull (for instance as a cancer counter mechanism). However, multi-cellular organisms evolved from single-cell eukaryotes.</p>

<p>I cannot see a reason for wanting apoptosis in a single-cell organism. However, single cell eukaryotes (say yeast) still have linear chromosomes with telomere caps. <strong>What advantage did linear chromosomes provide single-cell eukaryotes to offset the extra investment in reparing the telomere?</strong></p>

","<p>I think it is the wrong question. You assume that eukaryotes developed from a single-cell organism with circular DNA. Then, clearly, there must have been an advantage of (newly) developing a linear genome. But eukaryotes could have developed from an organism with linear DNA, too. There are still a few bacterial species with linear chromosomes, so this is not unlikely. We don't know, however.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if linearisation developed independently, you can learn from bacteria why it might have occurred:</p>

<p>J. N. Volff, J. Altenbuchner: <em>A new beginning with new ends: linearisation of circular chromosomes during bacterial evolution.</em> In: <em>FEMS microbiology letters.</em> 186, 2, May 2000, 143–150, PMID 10802162. (Review).</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bacterial circular chromosomes have sporadically become linearised
  during prokaryote evolution. Unrelated bacteria, including the
  spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and the actinomycete Streptomyces,
  have linear chromosomes. Linear chromosomes may have been formed
  through integration of linear plasmids. Linear chromosomes use linear
  plasmid strategies to resolve the 'end-of-replication problem', but
  they have generally retained from their circular ancestors a central
  origin of replication. Streptomyces linear chromosomes are very
  unstable and at high frequency undergo amplifications and large
  deletions, often removing the telomeres. At least in Streptomyces,
  chromosome linearity is reversible: circular chromosomes arise
  spontaneously as products of genetic instability or can be generated
  artificially by targeted recombination. Streptomyces circularised
  chromosomes are very unstable as well, indicating that genetic
  instability is not confined to the linearised chromosomes. Bacterial
  linear chromosomes may contain telomere-linked regions of enhanced
  genomic plasticity, which undergo more frequent genetic exchanges and
  rearrangements and allow differential evolution of genes, depending on
  their chromosomal location.</p>

"How does a smoker's finger or mustache get yellowish by nicotine?","6790","","<p>Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death around the world.<a href=""http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/11/e003304.full?rss=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">$\ce{^1}$</a> </p>

<p>The stain is considered as a ""tell-tale"" sign for identifying smokers. Multiple materials stated that it's due to tar (nicotine) disposition. The colouring fades away after the smoker quits. There are also number of search results that point to ""removing"" these smoking stains in the skin. If it can be removed using chemicals then I wonder what sort of a chemical it utilized there as well.</p>

<p>Is it only nicotine that causes the yellow stains on the skin? What is the role of oxygen deprivation in this scenario? Can this be categorized under smoker's melanosis? What tissues/cells are being ""transformed"" in this case? What's the biochemical explanation behind the colouring of skin?</p>

<p>How is this staining differe from a ink stain in the skin which lasts for about about 3-4 days?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/n3876?lang=en&amp;region=US"" rel=""nofollow"">Pure nicotine</a> is a yellow colored liquid (although <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Physical_and_chemical_properties"" rel=""nofollow"">some sources</a> say it's a clear liquid.) ""Tar"" is a complex sludge that is also yellow-brown. So it's difficult to distinguish 'nicotine stain' from a 'tar stain' based on visual inspection. Let's go to other considerations.</p>

<p>The concept of a 'stain' implies that simple hand washing doesn't remove the coloration. Since nicotine is water miscible, one would expect it's easily removed with soap and water. <strong>That implies that either a) a smoker's stain is <em>not</em> primarily nicotine, or b) the nicotine reacts with the skin to create the stain.</strong></p>

<p>Nicotine is sufficiently functionalized that it could conceivably undergo some interesting chemical reactions with proteins, but I don't think that's what's happening. A simple observation is that transdermal nicotine patches do not contain a colored agent, and do not stain the skin. Score one point for the ""mostly tar"" explanation. Cigarette smoke contains far more tar than nicotine, and tar will deposit on most-any surface (at ambient temperatures), so <strong>it's parsimonious to proceed with the ""mostly tar"" explanation.</strong></p>

<p>The picture shows that the stain occurs on both fingernails and skin. The most abundant protein that's common to those two tissues is keratin. Like other examples of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coomassie_Brilliant_Blue"" rel=""nofollow"">protein staining</a>, the mechanism is complicated and poorly understood, but the basic outline is that parts of keratin are greasy (the non-polar amino acids) that associate with other greasy things.  (EDIT: AliceD's answer also depicts the well-known staining of teeth, which are not keratinized, showing that the staining mechanism is likely a nonspecific adsorption of greasy things onto surfaces.)</p>

<p>The stain can be fixed through the involvement of free radicals and other reactive species in cigarette smoke, like formaldehyde. In this sense, reactive oxygen species are active participants. I don't think oxygen deprivation plays a role here. I don't think this can be described as a melanosis, as the skin isn't producing melanin in response to smoking but is simply being coated in tar.</p>

<p><strong>Even if the stain was completely fixed, the coloring would fade away as the exterior skin cells are sloughed off, consistent with normal skin physiology.</strong> This is the explanation for the fading of any stained epidermis. The persistence of tar stains on teeth (which do not exfoliate) further evinces that the stain is removed through the replacement of skin cells.</p>

"Why is the opposite of plantar flexion called ""dorsiflexion""?","6778","","<p>Why is the action of flexing the foot so that the toes move anteriorly/superiorly (i.e. in the direction opposite that which they move during plantar flexion) described as ""dorsiflexion?"" In the same vein, why is the top surface of the foot called the ""dorsal surface?"" </p>

<p>If anything, the action opposite to plantar flexion moves the foot in the ventral direction, doesn't it? And surely if you've ever seen a human in the anatomical position, you can see that there's nothing dorsal about the top surface of the foot - it's superior, perhaps, but by no means dorsal.</p>
","<p>Anatomical terms must be able to fit a wide variety of organisms, from insects to fish, dogs, horses, chimpanzees to humans. That's why the terms are sometimes confusing to people who are thinking only of bipedal humans.</p>

<p>In anatomy, the dorsum is the <strong>upper side of animals that typically run fly, swim or crawl in a horizontal position</strong>. In vertebrates the dorsum contains the backbone. In such an animal the ""ground side"" is the ventrum. </p>

<p>Due to varied orientation on quadrupedal mammals (where the term is more appropriately used) the ""back""-side of the hand, the ""top""-side of the foot and the upper surface of the tongue are referred to by the term dorsum.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/edn2U.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Does this picture help? Note the dorsal surfaces of the body, muzzle, feet.</p>

<p>In anatomy, the sole of the foot is called the <em>plantar</em> surface. The top of the foot is called the <em>dorsum</em> of the foot. (Imagine us walking on all fours like apes.) Therefore when you extend your foot, it's called plantar flexion; when you flex your foot upwards towards your head, it's called dorsiflexion.</p>

<p>Similarly, the arteries feeding the bottom of your foot form the plantar arch. Those feeding the top are the dorsal artery (or the dorsalis pedis).</p>

<p>Because anatomy must describe other animals than ourselves with other orientations, it must be consistent. In a quadruped, the dorsum of the tongue and the feet <em>do</em> actually point to it's ""back"" surface.</p>

<p>In humans, the ""back"" is actually the posterior surface, because we are not primarily in a horizontal orientation. The ventral surface is called ""anterior"". Thus we speak of the anterior cheat wall and the posterior chest wall, not the dorsal and ventral surfaces.</p>

"What if $rB=C$ in Hamilton's rule?","6777","","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection#Hamilton.27s_rule"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hamilton's rule</a> states that if $rB&gt;C$ then a gene giving altruistic behaviour will increase in frequency in the population. What would happen if $rB=C$? Will an individual perform the altruistic act?</p>
","<p>I agree with @Amory in the sense that Hamilton's rule is not a rule that applies to each specific individual and explain their behavior (or other traits). The Hamilton's rule describe the direction (and not the dynamic) of how a social traits evolve. A social trait is any trait which does not only affect the fitness of its carrier but also affect the fitness of other individuals in the population. Theoretically, all (or almost) traits are actually somehow social traits.</p>

<p>$RB&gt;C$ is a simplistic way of looking at Hamilton's rule which might bring you to some confusion. This formula makes more sense to me by replacing $B$ by $\frac{dw(x,y,z)}{dx}$ and $C$ by $\frac{dw(x,y,z)}{dy}$. $w(x,y,z)$ is the fitness function of a focal individual expressing trait $x$ and interacting with an individual drawn from a subpopulation expressing trait $y$ (expected value of the probability distribution of trait expression of individuals in the subpopulation) in a population expressing trait $z$ (expected value again). In the particular case where there is no population structure $y$ equals $z$. $\frac{dw(...)}{dx}$ describes the partial derivative of the fitness function according to the variable $x$.</p>

<p>Therefore the Hamilton's rule can be rewritten as:</p>

<p>$$R\cdot\frac{dw(x,y,z)}{dx}&gt;\frac{dw(x,y,z)}{dy}$$ where $R$ is the coefficient of relatedness which can itself be expressed as a correlation between the variables $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>Altruistic behavior evolves if (but not ""if and only if"") this rule is respected. Hope this reformulation of Hamilton's rule helps a bit understanding it.</p>

<p>In the special case where $R\cdot\frac{dw(x,y,z)}{dx}=\frac{dw(x,y,z)}{dy}$ then, the trait of interest is not selected (neither counter selected). Therefore the trait will evolve under genetic drift alone. While the allele frequencies are modified by drift, the Hamilton's rule might (or might not) differ from the equality and then the trait would not be neutral anymore.</p>

"Why does cutting onion cause tears?​","6749","","<p>When I looked on a couple of sites, I found that it is because of sulfuric acid produced by onions. But I could not find more details. What is the biochemical pathway by which onion causes tears? Also, which compound is responsible for it? If it is enzyme-catalyzed reaction, can we just stop the production of this enzyme without causing any side-effects?</p>
","<p>Interesting question! The cause of tears and itching is the chemicals produced by onion (<em>Allium cepa</em>). Lets go into some details.</p>

<p>Onions, coming from the family Liliaceae (also containing garlic, chives, scallions and leeks) store compounds known as amino acid sulfoxides, and the one we are talking about here is S-1-propenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (abbreviated as PRENCSO), also calles isoalliin (due to its similarity with alliin found in garlic). When onion is damaged (cut, chewed, etc.), an enzyme alliinase converts PRENCSO into 1-propenyl sulfenic acid. This compound is then converted into propanethial-S-oxide by an enzyme lachrymatory factor synthase (earlier this reaction was considered spontaneous). The reaction looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ATdP.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ATdP.gif"" alt=""pathway""></a></p>

<p>Propanethial-S-oxide is the major cause of the flavor and aroma of onion. However, it is a volatile compound i.e. vaporizes very quickly. When its vapors reach the eye, it causes tears because of being a lachrymator (<em>aka</em> tear gas) i.e. as soon as it comes in contact with cornea, it triggers a nervous response which leads to activation of lachrymal (tear) glands.</p>

<p><em>PS:</em> when propanethial-S-oxide comes in contact with cornea, a small amount of it reacts with water to form sulfuric acid. This sulfuric acid is the cause of itching and irritation in eyes due to onion. Also, scientists are now trying to genetically either modify or stop the production of lachrymatory factor synthase enzyme to produce tearless onions. This (modification) has even been achieved to a high efficiency, as another answer discusses. However, making tearless onions could prove harmful to the crop in several ways, as discussed <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296796112_Tearless_Onion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> As asked in comments, I will add some details about how the sulfuric acid is produced from the reaction between propanethial-S-oxide and water.</p>

<p>The only resource I could find giving some details about this was <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269332973_An_overview_of_bioactivity_of_onion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marta Corzo-Martínez, 2014</a>. They summarize the complete pathway in the following diagram:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uPnsz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uPnsz.jpg"" alt=""diagram""></a></p>

<p>After applying some common chemistry principles, the concerned reaction turns out to be:</p>

<p>$\ce{4~C_3H_6SO~+~4~H_2O \rightarrow 4~C_3H_6O~+~H_2SO_4~+~3~H_2S}$</p>

<p>As you see, one of the products of hydrolysis of propanethial-S-oxide is hydrogen sulfide ($\ce{H_2S}$). Just like $\ce{H_2SO_4}$, $\ce{H_2S}$ also causes irritation in the eyes (its effect on eyes has been well documented, see <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969706001240"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lambert <em>et al</em>, 2006</a> as an example). Thus, the produced $\ce{H_2S}$ only increases the irritation and itching in the eyes caused due to $\ce{H_2SO_4}$.</p>

<p><strong><em>BONUS:</em></strong> Another interesting point here is runny nose. propanethial-S-oxide is actually the compound responsible for the smell and flavor of onions. But, it causes tears by exciting the lachrymal glands i.e. reflexive lachrymation. propanethial-S-oxide excites the trigeminal nerve (the fifth cranial nerve) causing activation of lachrymal glands. Interestingly, the nerve endings of trigeminal nerve are also present in the nose, along with the eyes. So, this compound can also activate the lachrymal glands from your nose, and since the lachrymal duct is joined from eyes to nose, you can also experience runny nose along with tears and irritation in eyes.</p>

<p>In general, it is thought that <strong>mammalian organisms develop as females by default</strong> when there is no male (Y) chromosome present <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp048185"" rel=""nofollow"">(Hughes, 2004)</a>. Notably, X_ individuals and XY individuals with certain Y-chromosome deletions also develop as females. Basically, it is testosterone that <em>suppresses</em> female features.

<p>The development of nipples is a pretty complex process <a href=""http://dev.biologists.org/content/125/7/1285.long"" rel=""nofollow"">(Wysolmerski, 1998)</a>. Disruptions in the process cause regression. Indeed, in mice, the tissues typical for nipples <strong><em>do develop in males</em></strong> during embryogenesis, but degenerate within a few days, leaving no trace of nipples at birth.</p>

<p>Hence, given the mouse example, I <em>think</em> that <em>every mammalian male species develops by default nipples</em> somewhere in development like mice, but that development is halted at various stages across species. The later in development it halts, the more it resembles female nipples. When it is stopped very early after gestation, they regress completely, like in mice.   </p>

<p>Why is there a difference between species as to <em>when the nipple development halts</em>? Because the nipple developmental sequence is complex <a href=""http://dev.biologists.org/content/125/7/1285.long"" rel=""nofollow"">(Wysolmerski, 1998)</a>, and because evolution typically prefers <em>losing things</em> over gaining them, it is likely that by happenstance one of many crucial genes was lost in males, but selective pressure was simply too small to be of any significant advantage over males with slightly better-developed nipples. But from here on, it is guessing.</p>

  same genetic material divided in two on opposite sides of the embryo.
  Eventually, two separate fetuses develop. Spontaneous division of

For example, the glucose transporter uses the sodium gradient to transport glucose against the concentration gradient into the cell, while getting the energy by co-transporting sodium into the cell along the gradient. The sodium import yields energy. That in turn is caused by the Na<sup>+</sup> K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which builds up the sodium gradient using ATP. The glucose transporter is called a symporter, because it co-transports sodium into the cell. An antiporter transports another particle in the opposite direction.</li>
<li>Yes, true. The glucose transporter as explained above is an example of active carrier-mediated transport. Other carriers just mediate passive diffusion of, for example, large molecules that don't fit through channels and won't readily cross the cell membrane.</li>

"Does sample buffer require EDTA for protein separation on SDS PAGE?","6710","","<p>In sample buffer preparation we add EDTA, but if SDS-PAGE is for protein then is it necessary to add EDTA in sample buffer? What is role of EDTA in sample buffer for protein separation for SDS-PAGE. </p>
","<p>EDTA is a complexing agent for bivalent cations and is usually used to inhibit enzymes (proteases, nucleases) which need these ions in their active center to work. Without it they do not attack the sample. </p>

<p>The presence of EDTA in the sample buffer is interesting, since Laemmli's original paper from 1970 (""<a href=""http://www.directupload.net/file/d/3860/l6eqjwqh_pdf.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.""</a>) doesn't use it and I think it is not necessary.</p>

<p>The reason for this is simple: Protein samples are usually generated in buffers which contain different protease inhibitors, which protects the samples. Additionally the purpose of the sample buffer is to denaturate (at least for the standard SDS gels) the protein sample completely, so it will run uniformly. Both steps ensure that proteases are either inhibited or completely denaturated, which will both protect the sample.</p>

<p>The only reason I can think of for using EDTA is that it can help to destabilize your target protein, when a co-factor which is important for the structure is complexed by EDTA and thus keep it in solution after the denaturation.</p>

<p>There are of course ressources which state that EDTA is necessary for protein integrity, but they only say it is there to inhibit proteases by complexing metal ions (see <a href=""https://books.google.de/books?id=TbVtbD51FxgC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=edta%20in%20sds%20sample%20buffer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FD8RkmOf1W&amp;sig=9TVhxu1mNQncO5wCwGtowkRN76g&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j06tVO-MLczuUIKmhEg&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> for example).</p>

<p>As a 2x sample buffer, I use the following recipe (this can also be made 5x if necessary), which contains EDTA, but can also be done without. If you prefer β-Mercaptoethanol, you can use it in the same concentration as the DTT (which has the advantage of being less smelly):</p>

","<p>That's an interesting question and not easy to answer. I haven't found data for humans but from experiments with mice. They analysed how the mosquito actually bites, probes for the blood vessels (not all bites are successful) and finally sucks bloods. In their research  they observed feeding times between 150 and 329 seconds, depending on the size of the blood vessel. The mean feeding time was 240 seconds. It also depends on the age of the mosquito, older mosquitos suck longer. To this comes the time for probing (mean time 142 seconds) and the time before the mosquito starts probing after it landed (mean time 6.5 seconds). This totals to about 389 seconds (or roughly 6.5 minutes) total time after landing. This data can be found in table 1 of reference 2.</p>

<p>This is pretty interesting, they also show videos of the mosquito probing the skin for a blood vessel. You can find a pretty nice summary in the first reference and the original paper in the second:</p>

<li><p>If one eats $X$ grams of either saturated or unsaturated fats, will they (in equal conditions) gain equal weight ($Y$ grams) in both the cases ?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>There is a subtle difference between oils and fats- oils are generally unsaturated (Carbon-Carbon double bonds) whereas fats are saturated (all single bonds).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are these two types of fat have equal influence considering their converting to fat tissue in humans?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. There are some kinds of fatty acids that are synthesized only by plants (Essential fatty acids). However, these can be obtained indirectly from animal sources such as fish.</p>

<p>Fats have multiple roles- not just storage. They are also critical for making up the cell membrane. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the converting pathways for vegetable oil fats to adipose tissue in humans?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fatty acids in oils are absorbed in the intestine and esterified (wit glycerol) to form triglycerides. Then, they are incoporated in lipoprotein complexes. There are different types of lipoproteins- VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoprotein), LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) and HDL (High Density Lipoprotein) which have different sizes and compositions. </p>

<p>When lipoprotein comes in contact with lipoprotein lipase in capillaries, the free fatty acids are liberated from trigycerides, which is taken up by adipose tissue.</p>

<p>The fats stored in adipose tissue depends on diet. This has been <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/58/2/174.short"" rel=""nofollow"">studied in rabbit</a> but similar principles may apply to humans too. Fats can also be synthesized in the body. It is always saturated fat and is synthesized by the fatty acid synthase complex. The starting substance is Acetyl-CoA which is produced during catabolism of both carbohydrates and fats. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if one eat Y of 2 meal if saturated and unsaturated fats, he/she (in equal conditions) will gain X gram if they were saturated fat and Z in a case of unsaturated fats?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By principles of mass balance, if both have equal rates of absorption and degradation then there will be equal gain. According to <a href=""http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2872%2980115-X/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> study, absorption rate of unsaturated fats is higher. In that case if you eat $X$ grams of both types then the absorbed amount should be $Y_{sat}$ &lt; $Y_{unsat}$ </p>

<p>I am not sure about the degradation rates but I think it is higher for saturated fats because unsaturated has to be reduced to saturated before metabolizing via $\beta$-oxidation. Determining the exact steady state values will be tricky without a mathematical model. </p>

I am obviously not talking about the microscopic uses of metal, as in human blood etc.</p>

<p>Why are there no plants with metal thorns? No trees with ""reinforced"" wood? No metal-plated sloths? No beetles with metal-tipped drills? Or are there?</p>

<p>I can think of some <strong>potential factors</strong> why there are none (or few), but I do not know whether they are true:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is metal too <strong>scarce</strong> near the surface?</li>
<li>Are there certain chemical properties that make metal <strong>hard to extract and accumulate in larger quantities</strong>?</li>
<li>Is metal <strong>too heavy</strong> to carry around, even in a thin layer or mesh or tip?</li>
<li>Can metal of high (tensile etc.) strength only be forged under <strong>temperatures too high</strong> to sustain inside (or touching) organic tissue, and is <strong>crystallised metal too weak</strong>?</li>
<li>Are functionally comparable organic materials like horn, bone, wood, etc. in fact <strong>better at their tasks than metal</strong>, and do we humans only use metal because we are not good enough at using e.g. horn to make armour or chitin to make drills?</li>
</ol>

<p>As a predator, I would like to eat a lot of vertebrates and save up the metal from their blood to reinforce my fangs...</p>

<hr>

<p>A bonus question: are there any organisms that use the high <strong>electric conductivity</strong> of metal? Animals depend upon electric signals for their nervous system, but I do not think nerves contain much metal. The same applies to the few animals that use electricity as a weapon.</p>
","<p>There are some cases, as hinted at by the comments. But these are relatively small amount of metal.  </p>

<p>Its not that there is no metal available, but I can think of several reasons you don't see iron exoskeletons on animals all the time.  Firstly, fully reduced (oxidation state 0) metal has a high energetic cost to create in reduced form.  </p>

<p>Iron is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust"">second most common metal after aluminum on the earth's crust</a> but its almost entirely present in oxidized states - that's to say: as rust.  Most biological iron functions in the +2/+3 oxidation state, which is rust or closer to it than metal.  <a href=""http://rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=82&amp;evtc=Suggest&amp;evta=Moleculeof%20the%20Month&amp;evtl=OtherOptions"">Cytochromes</a> and <a href=""http://rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=41"">haemoglobin</a> are examples of how iron is more valuable as a chemically active biological agent than a structural agent, using oxidized iron ions as they do. <a href=""http://www.siliconfareast.com/ox_potential.htm"">Aluminium, the most common metal on earth has relatively little biological activity one might assume because its redox costs are even higher than iron</a>.  </p>

<p>If there are some reasons why reduced biometal doesn't show up very often, inability of biological systems to deposit reduced (metallic) metals is <em>not</em> one of them.  Bone and <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17950376"">shell</a> are examples of biomineralization where the proteins depositing the calcium carbonate or other oxides in the material are structured by the proteins to be stronger than they would be as a simple crystal.  There are cases of admittedly small pieces of reduced metal being produced by biological systems. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotactic_bacteria#Magnetosomes"">Magnetosomes</a> in magnetotactic bacteria are mentioned, but there are also cases of <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v495/n7440_supp/full/495S12a.html"">reduced gold being accumulated by microorganisms</a>.  </p>

<p>I would say that while iron skeletons might seem to be an advantage, they are electrochemically unstable - oxygen and water will tend to oxidize (rust) them quickly and the organism would have to spend a lot of energy keeping it in working form.  Electrical conductivity sounds useful, but the nervous system favors exquisite levels of control over bulk current flow, even in cases like electric eels, <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/70/9/2473.full.pdf"">whose current is produced by gradients from acetylcholine</a>.  </p>

<p>What's more, it is a fact that biological materials actually perform as well as or better than metal when they need to.  Spider silk has a greater tensile strength than steel (along the direction of the thread). Mollusc shells are models for tank armor - they are remarkably resistant to puncture and breakage.  The time it would take for metalized structures to evolve biologically might be too long - by the time the metalized version of an organ or skeleton got started, the bones, shells and fibers we know probably have a big lead and selective advantage. </p>

"How do viruses or bacteria survive outside the body long enough to spread?","6664","","<p>Say I cough on my table, then someone else touches it and picks up something I've got... how is it that these things can live outside the body, how long can they manage it, and how long is generally 'safe' to consider something no longer carrying these germs?</p>
","<p>It depends entirely on the environment the virus or bacterium is in and also the size of it. </p>

<p><strong>Virus</strong></p>

<p>With regards to viruses, the most important thing is typically whether or not the virus has an outer membrane or envelope.</p>

<p>Non-enveloped viruses such as rhinoviruses, noroviruses and adenoviruses can in fact survive for long periods outside the host (up to several days) whereas viruses with membranes such as HIV, influenza and the herpes viruses which do well in the host survive for shorter time periods.</p>

<p>Experiments with rhinoviruses and influenza viruses have shown potential survival times ranging from a few minutes to 48 hours or more.  They remain active longer on stainless steel, plastic and similar hard surfaces than on fabric and other soft surfaces. </p>

<p>This is because many enveloped viruses rely on the proteins on the surface of the membrane to attach to the host cell, this envelope is generally sensitive to degradation to sunlight and normal cleaning procedures.</p>

<p>Outbreaks associated with the non-enveloped viruses can continue for many months due to their relative stability in the environment, think of winter vomiting outbreaks, hand foot and mouth in animals as good examples of this phenomenon. </p>

<p><strong>Bacteria</strong></p>

<p>Because bacteria can undergo metabolism, synthesise proteins etc. for themselves, their life span is usually longer. If we split them into gram positive and gram negative its easier to discuss. Gram positive bacteria have a protein coat that prevents drying allowing them to survive longer. An example is the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which is responsible for toxic shock syndrome, food poisoning, and wound infections. With its protein coat it can withstand temperature and humidity extremes. The spore may survive for weeks on dry clothing using sloughed skin cells for food. The Bacillus anthracis, the anthrax bacteria, can also form spores and survive tens to hundreds of years. This is in comparison to gram negative which need humidity. An infamous example is Escherichia coli which survives typically only a few hours at best. </p>

","<p>There are many different reasons for an acute pain and inflammation (both directly via pain receptors, and indirectly via swelling etc.) plays not the least role in this phenomenon.

<li><strong>Alteration of Target Site</strong>: Mutations in genes encoding for target sites can reduce drug binding affinity. Example: Random mutations in DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV reduces binding affinity to fluoroquinolone. </li>
<li><strong>Alteration of Metabolic Pathways</strong>: Many drugs target certain parts of metabolic pathways by inactivating enzymes or sequestering substrates. Bacteria can use alternative metabolic pathways or find ways to uptake the necessary nutrients from the environment.</li>

"How does the NAD+/NADH ratio affect lifespan in vertebrates?","6571","","<p>Here's the proximate physical implication of the ratio (from the Wikipedia article on NADH).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD+/NADH ratio. This ratio is an
  important component of what is called the redox state of a cell, a
  measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health
  of cells. The effects of the NAD+/NADH ratio are complex,
  controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including
  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase.
  In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD+
  and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus
  favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total
  NAD+/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 0.05 to 4. In
  contrast, the NADP+/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is
  the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key
  to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So here's my question: how does this manifest in vertebrate aging? Is it something that's simply the resultant of other aging processes, or can the ratio also contribute to aging in a certain way?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://dx.doi.org/%20doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019194"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This study</a> found a statistically significant decline in NAD+:NADH ratios and in intracellular NAD+ with age in the organs of rats. </p>

<p>They discuss that the activation of  PARP - the  NAD-dependent enzyme Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 instrumental in DNA repair - increases in aging organs (heart, liver, kidneys). This depletes cellular NAD+ levels via poly(ADP-ribosylation) of proteins. This reduced cellular  NAD+ then reduces the effectiveness of Sirtuins (Sirt1) which can <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12220851"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">deacetylate tumor-suppressor proteins such as p53.</a></p>

","<p>A 2008 study on fruit flies found that when faced with an immediate threat, flies would tend to launch themselves into the air in the opposite direction to the threat.  So when confronted by a threat from directly ahead, the flies would jump backwards.</p>

<p>Interestingly, ""in response to stimuli approaching from the side, however, flies jumped at an angle that was approximately halfway between directly away and directly forward.""  In other words, the response was biased toward taking off in the forward direction.</p>

<p>The study's authors note that ""voluntary takeoffs elicited by either attractive odors or internal cues are almost always in the forward direction"".</p>

"How do large herbivores get enough protein?","6493","","<p>The food they eat seem extremely low on protein. Do they need less protein per mass unit than carnivores? Most of them grow quite a lot in the first year, is most of that from the mothers milk?</p>
","<p>It boils down to the anatomy.</p>

<p>Herbivores are very good at digesting plant matter, which us monogastrics are not particularly good at. Many herbivores (such as ruminants) have large, highly developed gastrointestinal tracts containing symbiotic bacteria to allow them to digest plant matter. Once the cellulose in the plant cell walls is digested, the animal can then access the nutrients  contained in the plant matter to a degree we cannot. Ruminants (such as cows) are even better able to absorb nutrients in this way than monograstric herbivores (such as horses). Rumen microbes are also an important source in ruminants for production of amino acids.</p>

<p>There's also a reason why the GI tract of these herbivores is so big. In the cow, it's an enormous rumen. In the horse, it's a massive colon for hindgut fermentation. To get all the nutrients they need - such as amino acids - these herbivores have to consume and ferment vast quantities of plant matter. A carnivore can generally get all the nutrients it needs in a much smaller meat meal, meaning it does not need such an extensive GI tract.  </p>

<p>Different species, of course, have different metabolic demands and corresponding nutritional needs. Cows and other herbivores cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need, meaning they have to be consumed through the diet. Though it is somewhat dated, an interesting discussion on this subject is <a href=""http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/bitstream/1/2033629/1/IVRI%203245.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Protein and Amino Acid Requirements of Mammals (PDF)</a> by Anthony Albanese (1950). The author goes through in great details the different protein requirements for various species, but I will bring your attention to one interesting table on p 116 as it is pertinent to your last question:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/usrEb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/usrEb.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the protein content of milk seems to correspond with the time to double birth weight. Cats with a high protein milk grow very quickly, while cows, horses, and humans grow comparitively more slowly (and thus have lower protein milk).</p>

<p>All animals have to get protein or amino acids through the diet, but they just have different methods to satisfy their metabolic requirements. For carnivores, they consume small protein-packed meals. For large herbivores, they have to consume and digest large quantities of plant matter to meet their needs.</p>

","<p>When physical damage to the cells occur a biological process called <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation"" rel=""nofollow"">inflammation</a> occurs. When inflammation occurs, white blood cells are rushed to the area in order to fight off any bacteria or harmful waste leakage from damaging the cells further. In order to get the white blood cells to the site of damage faster, the body induces a process called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"" rel=""nofollow"">vasodialation</a> where the arteries are expanded and blood is rushed to the site. This causes the site of injury to swell and redden, two signs of inflammation. The white puss that forms comes from the <a href=""http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/2/3/235.short?sso-checked=true"" rel=""nofollow"">white blood cells</a>. The white blood cells release chemicals that kill of bacteria and waste in the area and forms a white pus that will eventually harden or break through the skin to be exerted. If the site of impact begins swelling within a matter of hours, it is likely acute inflammation is occurring and the body is rushing blood to the site. However, if swelling occurs on a more rapid time scale it is more likely that this fluid is from the damage of the impact itself and the cells and capillaries are leaking blood and extracellular fluids (<a href=""http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/swelling-bodys-reaction-to-injury"" rel=""nofollow"">What is Swelling?</a>).  </p>

<p>In short, when you bump your head your body is trying to fight off further injury and infection by inducing the inflammatory response. It is also leaking fluids due to the impact and may result in rapid swelling at site of impact. The symptoms you discuss are due to inflammation and are a normal process of your body's defense mechanism. Hope this helps!</p>

"Why is the mosquito a definitive host in malaria?","6449","","<p>I thought that the definition of a definitive host was that the parasite had to sexually reproduce in that particular host. </p>

<p>I've been told that mosquitoes are the definitive host for the plasmodium parasite, but I thought that the fertilization (and thus the sexual reproduction) takes place in the human?</p>
","<p><em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> (the main causative agent of malaria) and other <em>Plasmodium</em> species have a very complex life cycle, with stages in the female host <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Anopheles</em></a> mosquito, in the human liver, and in the human circulatory system, where it primarily resides in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">erythrocytes</a> (red blood cells, or RBCs):</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/malaria/malaria_LifeCycle.gif"" alt=""Plasmodium spp. life cycle""></p>

<p>During a blood meal, a malaria-infected mosquito injects sporozoites in its saliva into the human host (<strong><em>1</em></strong>). Sporozoites travel through the circulatory system and first infect <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hepatocytes</a> (liver cells) (<strong><em>2</em></strong>, stage <strong><em>A</em></strong>) and mature into schizonts (<strong><em>3</em></strong>), which rupture and release merozoites (<strong><em>4</em></strong>). After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony (<strong><em>A</em></strong>), which can last a minimum of 5.5 days), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony (stage <strong><em>B</em></strong>)). Merozoites leave the liver and enter the circulatory system where they infect red blood cells (<strong><em>5</em></strong>). The ring stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture releasing more merozoites, which continue the cycle of infection of RBCs (<strong><em>6</em></strong>). Some immature trophozoites, in the so-called ""ring stage,"" differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes) (<strong><em>7</em></strong>). Blood stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. </p>

<p>It is important to note here (in answer to your question) that while the male and female gametocytes are formed at this stage in the human (the equivalent of meiosis), sexual reproduction does not occur until the micro and macrogametocytes are taken up by a mosquito.</p>

<p>The male (microgametocytes) and female (macrogametocytes) gametocytes are ingested by a female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito during a blood meal (<strong><em>8</em></strong>) - only female mosquitoes (of pretty much any species) drink blood. The parasites' multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle (stage <strong><em>C</em></strong>). While in the mosquito's stomach, the microgametes penetrate the macrogametes generating zygotes (<strong><em>9</em></strong>). The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) (<strong><em>10</em></strong>) which invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts (<strong><em>11</em></strong>). The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites (<strong><em>12</em></strong>), which make their way to the mosquito's salivary glands. Inoculation of the sporozoites into a new human host perpetuates the malaria life cycle (<strong><em>1</em></strong>).</p>

<li>There is no universally accepted size threshold for being called a microbe (to my knowledge). I would go with a threshold of about $10^{-5}$ meters.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Is a virus a microbe?</strong></p>

<p>A virus IS and IS NOT alive depending on the definition. Note btw, that the definition of what is alive is not a matter of Biology but a matter of Philosophy. Most of the time, viruses are considered as not being alive. <em>It is important to understand that the definition of life has absolutely no impact on biology and is nothing but a question of nomenclature.</em></p>

<p>If you want to call a virus a living thing, then yes, viruses are microbes. As stated on the wiki article:</p>

  <p>Some microbiologists also classify viruses (and viroids) as microorganisms, but others consider these as nonliving.</p>

<p>It would seem to be a huge evolutionary advantage for an animal to be able to drink sea water rather than have to rely on fresh water, and it's provably not impossible due to the existence of sea mammals that must filter the sea water somehow.</p>

<p>Could someone explain to me any likely reasons that this is the case?</p>
","<p>For humans, our blood and other tissues have a salinity which is less than that of sea water. The <a href=""http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?&amp;id=100803&amp;ver=1&amp;trm=osmolarity"">osmolarity of blood is 275-299mOsm/L</a>, while the <a href=""http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu//bionumber.aspx?&amp;id=100802&amp;ver=5"">osmolarity of seawater is ~1000 mOsm/L</a>. </p>

<p>The major reason we need to drink and excrete (sweat, breath and urine) water is to rid the system of waste- i.e. water soluble chemicals or heat we do not need.  The kidneys do a lot of this work and they need a reasonable osmotic potential to help them.  </p>

<p>The osmotic potential is the tendency of molecules, for instance salts, to diffuse from one reservoir of liquid to another.  The kidneys burn metabolic energy (food) to create a slightly higher concentration of waste chemicals into the bladder/urine.  Other organs will fail or also work to maintain a local salt concentration (e.g. any nerve cell which depends on Na+/K+ concentrations to transmit their signals.  But the kidneys are the gatekeepers of salinity in the body.  They work hardest (and can get injured) when there is more salt in the water we drink. If you drink sea water you will quickly find your kidneys overworked and not really functioning.  </p>

<p>That's why salt water will tend to make you thirsty (if you can drink any at all). Most people will gag when they drink even a little sea water, much less a glassful. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-can-sea-mammals-drink/"">Sea mammals actually eat their fresh water.</a> They rely on the fluid they get from fish to keep their salt balance.  Its true that some animals like fish and molluscs etc have adapted other means of keeping their salt balance in check.

","<p>Both the Forewing as well as the Hindwing of Butterflies are made of thin chitin structures which are pretty thin and sensitive. If you touch the wing with to much force, it may break.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/N3KFU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The scales have a number of functions, they are responsible for the butterflies color and pattern (which are important for finding mating partners as well as for camouflage) and they also seem to play a role in insulation and thermo regulation (see <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00379348?LI=true"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for more details).</p>

<p>The scales play also a role in making the wings stronger and help improving the flight characteristics. When flying upwards the get pressed to the wing and act aerodynamically, what the wings are in downward motion, they help stabilizing the flight. See here for more details: ""<a href=""http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/faculties/science/2008/m.a.giraldo/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Butterfly wing scales : pigmentation and structural properties</a>"".</p>

<p>Some of the scales get lost during flying and collecting nectar, so taken together, loss of a big number of them will influence the flight characteristics of a butterfly.

<p>The main argument for why viruses aren't living is basically what has been said already.  Viruses are obligate parasites, and while plenty of parasites are indeed living what sets viruses apart is that they always rely on the host for the <em>machinery</em> with which to replicate.  A parasitic worm may need the host to survive, using the host as a source for energy, but the worm produces and synthesizes its own proteins using its own ribosomes and associated complexes.</p>

One advantage of this definition, for example, is that it is a positive selection (everyone ""alive"" has got ribosomes) which eliminates things like mitochondria that are sort of near the boundary of other definitions.  There are examples on either side of something that breaks every other rule but not this one.  Another common rule is metabolism and while that suffices for most cases some living parasites have lost metabolic activity, relying on their host for energy.</p>

<p>However (and this is the really interesting part) even the ribosome definition is a bit shaky, especially as viruses have been found encoding things like their own tRNAs.  Here are a few points to think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have ribosome encoding organisms (REOs), so why can't we define viruses as capsid encoding organisms (CEOs)?</li>
<li>Comparing viruses to a living organism such as a human is absurd, given the massive differences in complexity.  A virus, really, is just a vehicle or genetic material, and would be more rightly compared to a sperm cell.  Is a sperm cell alive, or is it a package for genetic material that is <em>capable</em> of life once it has infected/fertilized another cell?</li>
<li>The really large DNA viruses often create cytoplasmic features called virus factories.  These look an awful lot like a nucleus.  What is a nucleus anyway?  Maybe it's just a very successful DNA virus that never left.</li>
<li>Viruses can get <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_virophage"">viruses</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll wind down here, but suffice to say that while our current definition may have sufficed for a while, and still does, it is no longer quite solid.  In particular, there is a theory alluded to above that eukaryotic life itself actually formed <em>because</em> of viruses.  I can expand on this if you like, but here are some great sources:</p>

Serial monogamy means most will have a single partner at a time but  will likely have several partners throughout their life, there is however an under current (~15%) of hidden cheating in most studied populations. Also I say mostly becasue human behavior is plastic and nearly every possible combination exists, albeit in small numbers.  Males do have a stronger <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224490409552211"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tendency</a> to seek multiple partners at the same time, which makes biological sense.<br>

"What's the difference between stabilizing selection and balancing selection?","6381","","<p>I came across these terms in Darwin's ""Origin of Species"" and I wasn't sure what the difference is.</p>
","<p><strong>Usual meaning</strong></p>

<p>Usually, Stabilizing selection is a concept that applies to a phenotypic trait while balancing selection is a concept that applies to a given locus.</p>

<p>Balancing selection can either be due to negative-frequency dependence selection or due to overdominance (=heterozygous advantage at a single locus).</p>

<p><strong>What Darwin may have meant</strong></p>

<p>Because Darwin didn't know about genes, he was necessarily not using the term balancing selection as I am using it. I can think of several more or less related pattern of selection that might fall withing the definitions for ""stabilizing selection"" and/or ""balancing selection"". Maybe he meant ""frequency-dependent selection"", ""positive selection for an intermediate trait"", ""varying selection through time (temporally heterogenous environment)"" and ""varying selection through space (spatially heterogenous environment)"". Eventually again, that might mean ""positively correlated traits that undergo opposite selection pressure (or the opposite)"" but that would definitely be surprising.</p>

"Confusion about resting membrane potential and the Na/K pump","6378","","<p>To this day, very few people and sources have been able to clear up my confusion about resting membrane potential and how it is maintained. It seems like this is one of those topics that few people are able to explain very well...</p>

<p>Here is what I do understand:</p>

<p>Chemical Gradients:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>at rest, the inside of a neuron is negative and comprised mostly of Potassium (+) and negatively charged proteins (-)</p></li>
<li><p>at rest, the outside of a neuron is positive and comprised mostly of Sodium (+) and Chloride (-)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Electrical Gradients:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>at rest, the sodium ions are attracted to the negative charge on the inside of the cell and tend to move inwards</p></li>
<li><p>at rest, the Potassium ions on the inside of the cell are attracted to the negatively charged chloride ions on the outside of the cell and thus move outwards</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So overall, there is a net inflow of Sodium and a net outflow of Potassium. Got it, pretty simple.</p>

<p>However, the sodium/potassium pump is where I get lost. Why does it reverse all that just happened, and why doesn't it cancel out the resting potential if it moves K+ back inside and Na+ back outside? Isn't the voltage fluctuating because of this back and forth movement of K+ out, K+ back in, Na+ in, Na+ back out, etc.? I would imagine this would completely negate the positive/negative charge distribution, but it doesn't. Why?</p>

<p>Clarification: there is a net outflow of Potassium and a net inflow of Sodium. Why does the Sodium/Potassium pump intentionally reverse this by pumping out Sodium and pumping in Potassium? How does that contribute to resting potential? </p>
","<p>The Sodium/Potassium pump maintains the overall concentrations of ions on either side of the membrane. In other words it keeps the neuron's battery charged. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/btZT8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/btZT8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Imagine the neuron like a circuit. We can imagine that the electro-chemical gradient for each ion species (Potassium, Sodium, and so on) as batteries. So When the ions flow according to their electrochemical gradient, the potassium current flows outward and sodium  current flows inward as dictated by these batteries reversal potentials [negative for potassium, positive for sodium]. </p>

<p>However, note that this will discharge those batteries, i.e. the concentration of sodium on the outside of the cell will drop (slightly) as sodium flows inward the cell, and potassium flows outward the concentration on the inside will drop slightly. Thus the magnitude of the reversal potential of the Sodium and Potassium drops (they move closer to zero). </p>

<p>To counteract this discharge the Sodium/Potassium pumps expends energy in the form of ATP in order to recharge the batteries. The amount of current that the pumps moves is very small relative to the larger currents of sodium rushing in and the potassium rushing out during an Action Potential. Thus when a neuron fires there is very little overall current contribution from the pumps. </p>

<p>When the neuron is at rest (not firing) then the Sodium/Potassium pump is able to recharge the membrane and the current becomes important. Still this is a very slow process, relative to action potentials.  </p>

<p>Another thing to note, even though the cell is at rest the batteries are discharging slightly. Their is a leakiness to the membrane, sodium leaks in and potassium leaks out. Thus the pump's current will counteract these leaky currents at rest, keeping the batteries charged and thus the overall net current  across the membrane at rest will be zero.  </p>

<p>Remember though, these currents are very small currents. </p>

<p>EDIT: Based on Discussion with @Christiaan, I decided to post a update to clarify.</p>

<p>At rest potential Sodium Ion influx is much smaller than potassium ion efflux and thus can be ignored. Whether or not Sodium is ignored the above still holds true. The neuron's membrane is at rest which means the net current is equal to zero. This means that the outward potassium current is counterbalanced by the pump's current thus keeping the relative concentrations of Potassium and Sodium constant while at rest and maintaining a steady rest potential.  </p>

<p>EDIT 2: Clarifying as per OP comment:</p>

<p>So during an action potential Sodium and Potassium ions move in large currents and this current flow discharges the batteries. At rest there is still current flowing (thus smaller discharging of the battery) but there is no <em>Net</em> current flow thus no change in voltage(thus the neuron is at rest). It is exactly counterbalanced by the sodium/potassium pumps. The reasons the pump doesn't overcharge the batteries is the constant but smaller discharge at rest. When the recharging current is equal and opposite to the discharge via the leak current, a equilibrium is reached.</p>

<p>However when lots of action potentials fire, the resting potential will be altered from the larger discharge rate, thus when the neuron returns to its new resting potential the leak current and pump current will not be balanced, thus the recharging pump current will be larger in magnitude and will bring resting potential back to its normal value.  (Note what constitutes large is relative between species and even neurons.) </p>

<p>Edit 3: Rates of Leakiness and Pump activity.</p>

<p>If only you could say one is stronger than the other. It depends on the conditions of the cell.</p>

<p>Lets focus in on potassium. The leak current for potassium is dependent on two (really three) things. The permeability (or conductance) to the membrane to potassium, and the reversal potential of potassium (which is dependant on the internal and external Concentration of Potassium. Thus varying these things will strengthen/weaken the power of the leak current. </p>

<p>The Sodium Potassium Pump is dependent on three things. The External Concentration of Potassium, The internal concentration of Sodium and the availability of energy (in the form of ATP). </p>

<p>The point where these two strengths are about the same is when there is more Potassium on the inside of the cell. That is to say pump is capable of keeping up with the leakiness of the membrane until the internal concentration of potassium reaches about $140$ $mM$ (again that just a ballpark number). If their is less Potassium in the cell then $140$ $mM$ the pump is stronger, if there is more than $140$ $mM$ the leak of potassium is stronger.     </p>

"How long does it take for memory to disperse after death?","6348","","<p>1: There seem to be cases where coma patients with a non-active brain (i.e. flat EEG) have regained full consciousness. => Apparently memory and knowledge are stored independent of brain activity.</p>

<p>2: There seem to be animals (e.g. hamsters) that can be frozen to complete organic inactivity and will regain full functionality after being thawed. => Apparently the stored memory does not depend on blood flow and other support.</p>

<p>3: From this I assume that quickly cooling a human brain to a temperature low enough to avoid decomposition would preserve the state of that brain that corresponds to that human's memories, knowledge, cogntivie abilities, and maybe consciousness at the time of cooling. => With the proper technology that ""content"" is theoretically retrievable.</p>

<p>Q: <strong>How long would that state remain after death in a brain left at room temperature?</strong></p>

<p>Or in other words: How long does it take for decomposition to destroy memory?</p>

<hr>

<p>Addendum:</p>

<p>The fact that the stored memory may not be accessible with current means is not relevant to my question. We cannot access the information stored in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A"">Linear A</a>, but this unretrievability does not delete the information.</p>
","<p>There are multiple levels of memory, some of which would die immediately, some of which would take some time. So the answer is: it depends; some immediately, some only very slowly.</p>

<p>At the highest level, the current neuronal firing state of the brain encodes memory on a very short scale - working memory. The memory held on this level does not have a clear anatomical counterpart (but for the <em>potential</em> encoded in the synapses). It equals very short-term memory/STM sequences, such as the words you read just before you read the words you're reading right now. This memory is lost immediately when you lose consciousness, at least to some degree; as this memory is hard to even strictly distinguish from consciousness and attention (though see <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17854286"">Jonides et al. 2008</a>).</p>

<p>Other forms of short-term memory/STM are stored in a slightly different form: short-term potentation, the adaption of neuronal responses following brief and intense stimulation. Spike Frequency Adaption/SFA is at an intermediate stage between this and the previous level. Short-term potentation and SFA decay within minutes or even seconds if they are not transferred into some more durable form of memory.</p>

<p>Long-term memory (/LTM) stores have specific anatomical correlates; they are stored in, amongst others, the synaptic weights (i.e. the amount of influence the firing of one neuron has on another). Some forms of LTM are best located in cortical synapses, others in the hippocampus. An even more fundamental, long-term, durable storage form is the wiring itself; not just the weights, but the existence of a synapse between two points, or not. For example, an important part of early learning is synaptic pruning, where synapses which do not play a meaningful role die off, whereas those which connect functionally related brain areas remain.
This pruning instantiates one form of learning, and the <em>non-existence</em> of a synapse is a form of memory. Synapses are comparatively stable. Even if the corresponding neurons die, in principle, the synapses still exist - and more importantly, the nonexistence of a synapse is even more durable. This form of memory can be observed in slice preparations of animals long dead.</p>

<p>For a simple example, consider any experiment on the neuronal responses in slice preparations, which can be considered a form of (decontextualised) memory access.</p>

<p>On the most extreme end, epigenetic adaptions and large-scale brain anatomy (which shows developmental traces) can be considered a form of memory that will remain intact until the whole structure rots away.</p>

<p>However, the more direct answer to the question the OP is asking is that once a large amount of neurons have died (brain death), there is currently no power on earth that can access a non-trivial amount of memory. As long as this is averted, nontrivial amounts of memory can be recovered.
For the parts that are lost immediately, see the source by Jonides et al. For more durable memory, you could look at for example <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10799/"">Purves et al, Neuroscience</a>.</p>

"Why does oxygen bind to hemoglobin in an specific angle?","6345","","<p>There is an specific angle of the bond between oxygen and hemoglobin in lungs, which I don't know, but what interests me more is the question, why is it specific?</p>
","<p>summary: 
O2 could form a linear complex with the Fe atom, but then it would start to look more like a mineral Fe=O...O bond - a linear bond would be like a transition state to an iron oxide (rust).   An Fe-O-O bent bond preserves more of the electronic character of the O2 molecule and promotes strong but reversible binding to Hemoglobin.</p>

<p>The oxygen molecule forms a partial covalent bond with the iron in the heme (the ringlike molecule in the picture below <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ovXx.jpg"" alt=""nice picture from Rice Univ Biotechnology intro class""> ).  The lone pair of electrons of the oxygen atom which forms the bond to the iron has a 120 degree angle with respect to the oxygen molecule itself.  In chemistry we say it is sp2 hybridized.  This implies a slightly greater than 120 degree angle between the Fe-O and the O-O axis would be energetically preferred in oxygen binding. </p>

<p>You can see on the other end of the oxygen, there is a histidine sidechain nitrogen which interacts in a similar way - crooked at a similar angle to the oxygen molecule. </p>

<p>As @MattDMo points out in the comments, it would not be 120 degrees exactly in fact even freshman chemistry molecular orbital theory would say that the double bond would take up more 'space' than the sp2 orbitals, widening out the angle Fe-O=O angle to be greater than 120 degrees.  Then the protein has its own geometry - the histidine and the heme iron are fixed in space and probably have their own location, so this is just an approximate, qualitative bond angle..</p>

<p>The claims of <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/67/4/1846.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">superoxide formation</a> is because the oxygen is diamagnetic the iron and he oxygen, which are both paramagnetic, somehow pair to eliminate their magnetic moment.  The PNAS paper cited here goes in depth on this issue.  The article curiously just says the highly reactive superoxide is kept from being chemically consumed by the hydrophobic pocket around it.  </p>

<p>The oxygen almost makes a superoxygen the iron sort of oxidizes but doesn't quite. Its also due to the peroxide like character of the oxygen molecule, partially bonded at both ends.  </p>

<p>Still the point is that hemoglobin holds onto the oxygen by making a partial covalent bond.  After all when the O2 unbinds, its just O2 again.  A <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC392294/pdf/pnas00024-0012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">later study</a> does detect some paramagnetism at low temperatures. In the last word on this that I could find, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC431209/pdf/pnas00029-0024.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pauling does a review</a> and concludes that the electronic state of the heme iron and oxygen complex is a combination of three different electronic states - partly superoxygen, partly oxy-iron and molecular oxygen.  </p>

<p>The reference also gives the Fe-O-O angle as 117 degrees.</p>

<p>[Just a note that the <a href=""http://www.bioc.rice.edu/bios576/proteng/protengsite.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reference page I got the picture from</a> refers to <em>rational design</em> of the hemoglobin molecule...in this case they are engineers talking about how they could change the amino acids in the protein to get other properties out of the hemoglobin system - rationally.]</p>

<p>Also: is this merely a perceived smell or is there actually ammonia in/on my body after the exercise.</p>
","<p>There are two explanations which come to mind answering your question:</p>

<p>I asked if you eat a lot of protein, because the amount of protein which some body builders consume leads to renal failure. And one sign of renal failure is the smell of ammonia. It's a quite common problem. But I don't think this applies to you. Your protein intake shouldn't exceed 2g per kg of body weight per day, some body builder eat up 4g per kg. </p>

<p>Ammonia is normally linked to your protein metabolism, which is higher during and after sport. The smell of Ammonia can occur when your carbohydrate reservoir is depleted and the body is mainly using protein as fuel. This effect also occurs when fasting or in patients with diabetes.</p>

<p>Try to keep your blood sugar level raised during exercise by eating something, like a banana, powerbars (also known as high energy bar) or directly dextrose. Or eat more long-chain carbohydrates.

It does cost some money and people wonder whether using so much roundUp is good.  I won't come down on the benefits of this, but you can see how it might be more economical way to grow crops.  roundUp is biodegradable and does break down in about 3 weeks, just FYI. </p>

<p>Other GMO foods can make the crops more resistant to drought, disease or insects. This might enable crops to be grown in areas and or with longer growing seasons - a big advantage for thirsy crops like tomatos or rice.

A famous example of this is <a href=""http://www.goldenrice.org/"">golden rice</a>, which has been enhanced to produce pro-vitaminA, which will help malnutrition in millions of children who can die annually because of a lack of vitamins in their diet.  </p>

<p>MY QUESTION : What are the difficulties that are not allowing us to understand the precise role of this enzyme ?</p>
","<p>Note: This is NOT my field. However, given @biogirl's question, it appears that there aren't many people in this field in the first place. From what I can gather, here are the reasons why I think it has been difficult to study.</p>

<p>I. <em>The lac operon has strong polarity.</em> By this I mean that when the lac operon is induced, <em>lacZ</em> (the first gene in the operon) is translated much more than <em>lacA</em> (the last gene in the operon). <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4863045"" rel=""nofollow"">Measurements</a> have recorded the molar ratio of $\beta$-galactosidase : thiogalactoside transacetylase (the protein products of <em>lacZ</em> and <em>lacA</em>) upon induction of the operon at 3:1 to 5:1; i.e. when the lac operon is induced 3 to 5 molecules of $\beta$-gal are produced for every one of the transacetylase. If you factor in the relative length of each of these proteins ($\beta$-gal is 1024 a.a.s, transacetylase is 203), <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123418"" rel=""nofollow"">it works out</a> that <em>lacZ</em> is being translated at least 10 times faster than <em>lacA</em> when the lac operon is induced. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123418"" rel=""nofollow"">Sidney Altman's lab</a> has attributed this to the fact that there is a cleavage site between <em>lacY</em> and lacA where RNAses can cleave the nascent mRNA transcript, removing <em>lacA</em> from the operon and reducing the production rate of transacetylase. So it appears the cell needs quite a bit less <em>lacA</em> than <em>lacZ</em>---if indeed they need it at all, see point 2---which makes it harder to study.</p>

<p>II. lacA <em>seems to provide only a small fitness advantage under somewhat contrived conditions.</em> In <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/789355"" rel=""nofollow"">A paper</a> from the 70s researchers presented competition experiments between $lacA^{+}$ and $lacA^{-}$ strains in media with $\beta$-galactosides as the only carbon source. For 50 generations there was no competitive advantage of one strain over the other (ratio of $lacA^{+}$ : $lacA^{-}$ stayed at 1). When after 50 generations the researchers added a lot of IPTG, a non-hydrolyzable $\beta$-galactoside, $lacA^{+}$ outcompeted $lacA^{-}$; the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_%28biology%29#Absolute_fitness"" rel=""nofollow"">absolute fitness</a> of wild-type:mutant could be calculated to be $\approx 1.05$. This means that the wild-type produced 105 cells for every 100 produced by the mutant. I am not a population geneticist, so I don't know if that is a large value or not. For comparison, I used to work in cyanobacterial circadian rhythms, and the absolute fitness advantage for having a circadian clock with the same period as the light-dark cycle in the environment works out to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9671734"" rel=""nofollow"">$&gt;1.11$</a>, which is twice as advantageous as the one reported for $lacA^{+}$ over $lacA^-$. In any case, the experimental situation in which $lacA^+$ has a competitive advantage seems rather contrived: growing with $\beta$-galactosides as the sole carbon source with a significant amount of non-hydrolyzable analoges around gumming up the $\beta$-galactoside metabolic machinery.</p>

<p>My read from these observations is that the physiological role of <em>lacA</em> is challenging for a biologist to untangle due to the small size of its effect on bacterial physiology. Fitness advantages of 5% may certainly be useful on evolutionary timescales, but they suggest that the benefit afforded by the enzyme will be very hard to discriminate from noise or other confounding factors in the system. The fact that <em>lacA</em> production is much lower than <em>lacZ</em> in times of lac operon induction also would make it hard to measure. </p>

<p>A postdoc I used to work with advised me, ""don't go looking for 2-fold changes in biology,"" by which he meant don't spend too much time on questions where the size of the effect you are looking at is minor and very difficult to distinguish from noise, bias, measurement error, or other confounding variables. Obviously there are limitations to this advice; a lot can be learned from the the combination of several seemingly minor effects that have big cumulative consequences for an organism. But as a rule of thumb, it's so hard to get strong results when your effect size is so small that going after small effects is justifiable only if you have a good reason to believe there is some profound, fundamental biology behind them. My view is that the consensus of the scientific community up to this point has been that untangling the role of <em>lacA</em> in the lac operon and more broadly in bacterial physiology would involve too much work for too little payoff.</p>

"Why do Asian people have black hair and Northern people have golden hair?","6251","","<p>I have got two questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why do all Asian people have black hair?</li>
<li>Why do all people from the northern countries (Sweeden, Norway, Finland) have light (golden) hair?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for an answer.</p>
","<p>All people don't have those hair colors. All people from those Northern countries aren't blond, and there are blond people outside of Northern Europe; I don't know if you count Melanesians as ""Asian"", but they have blond people among them:<br>
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesians#Incidence_of_blond_hair_in_Melanesia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesians#Incidence_of_blond_hair_in_Melanesia</a></p>

<p>Still; there are two, really three, different kinds of answers to this type of question.</p>

<p>1) Human populations differ through random drift and assortative mating: populations that are separated will develop different mutations over time that make them look different, and different populations may find different traits attractive (including traits that mark them as part of that population), which would work to amplify those differences even when the populations interact. There is no deep reason for those traits other than ""that mutation happened to occur and spread through this population"".</p>

<p>2) Certain traits are more or less useful in different environments, and thus will spread through natural selection. The issue here is that this is the kind of explanation people intuitively love (every difference must have a <em>reason</em> for its existence) but it's actually very hard to separate it from the first explanation.</p>

<p>3) Certain traits can be considered ""human-default"", as in the common ancestor of humans had it, most humans still have it, so the question of ""why does a human population have this trait"" is less relevant than ""why do some human populations not have this trait"".</p>

<p>So having said that, black hair seems like the clearly ancestral state, and so Asian populations probably have black hair for the same reason almost all human populations have black hair. And black hair seems common in great apes in general - Orang Utans are the only exception I can think of.</p>

<p>As for Northern Europeans, blond hair and white skin are actually one of those traits where it's hard to separate random variation from natural selection. It is quite likely there are advantages to being fair in high latitudes where there is little sunlight; you need less protection from the sun in the first place, and you need to be able to get enough vitamin D from sunlight on the other. However this applies much more obviously to skin than to hair. Blond hair is the result of very few mutations, which are thought to have appeared around 11,000 years ago. So it could be that those mutations happened to occur and to spread through those populations and not others and that's why they're blond and most other human populations (Melanesians excepted) are not. Or it could be that once those mutations happened they spread particularly well in those populations because it was adaptive in their environment. The question isn't scientifically settled.</p>

"How to increase the shelf life of yogurt without refrigeration?","6228","","<p>When we make yogurt at home and do not refrigerate it, it will become sour because of conversion of lactose into lactic acid by Lactobacillus bacteria, but this does not happen in case of Nestle's yogurt or any other brand until it remains air tight.</p>

<p>I wonder though bacteria is still present in it and continue to convert lactose into lactic acid then why does not packed yogurt becomes sour? How these companies increase the shelf life of yogurt..?</p>
","<p>This article gives an excellent review on yogurt manufacturing, but to summarize:</p>

<p>-Raw milk goes through centrifugation to remove somatic cells and other solid impurities.
-Thermalization is conducted at ""60–69 °C for 20–30 s, aiming at the killing of many vegetative microorganisms and the partial inactivation of some enzymes.""</p>

<p>After this point, the milk may be inoculated with lactic acid bacteria or other microfloras.</p>

<p>-Then, standardization occurs which for milk refers to the standardization of fat and solid-non-fat content (SNF).  This in short affects the fermentation process (""an increase of SNF increases the duration of the fermentation process"").</p>

<p>-The next step is homogenization, which prevents milk fat from rising to the top of the liquid.  This has an effect on the stability of the emulsion.</p>

<p>-I think this step is where ""sterility"" comes into play, ""heat treatment of milk reduces the number of pathogenic microorganisms to safe limits for the consumer’s health. Various heat treatments can be applied, which are classified based on the duration and the temperature. The most common are known as thermalization, low and high pasteurization, sterilization and UHT (Ultra Heat Treatment).""  The review goes into more detail about each type and what they eliminate or don't eliminate (spores, vegetative bacteria, etc.).  </p>

<p>-The fermentation process is the most important one for developing flavor and texture.  The two live bacterial strains of <em>Streptococcus salivarius</em> subsp. <em>thermophilus</em> (ST) and <em>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</em> subsp. <em>bulgaricus</em> (LB) are the two most basic strains used in yogurt.  LB is what metabolizes lactose into lactic acid and LB and ST acting in synergy is what causes a decrease in milk pH.  ""When the pH of the yogurt approaches 5.0, activity of ST subsides and LB gradually dominates the overall fermentation process until the target value of pH is reached and the fermentation process ceases. Normally, the fermentation period is terminated by lowering the temperature to 4 °C. At this temperature, the culture is still alive, but its activity is drastically limited to allow controlled flavor during storage and distribution.""  I think to answer your question, yogurt manufacturers probably have a very sensitive gauge for pH and can control temperature fluctuations finely to maintain yogurt pH and flavor (not too sour).  ""After the pH of yogurt reaches the value of 4.7–4.3, the yogurt is cooled to around 5 °C. This inhibits the growth and metabolic reaction of the starter culture and prevents the rise in acidity. Cooling of yogurt can be in one or two phases. One-phase cooling involves the rapid decrease of the coagulum temperature to less than 10 °C, where the fermentation process is inhibited leading to yogurt with low viscosity. Two-phase cooling is initiated by rapidly decreasing the temperature to less than 20 °C and then gradually reaching the storage temperature of 5 °C leading to yogurt with an increased viscosity and limited syneresis. This is quite common in the yogurt manufacture process, especially when fruits are to be added.""</p>

<p>You can read about the other innovative methods involved in yogurt making such as: Ultra High Pressure (UHP) which inactivates pathogens and microorganisms that cause milk to spoil, High Intensity Ultrasonication and Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) which all can reduce microbial content.</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot to mention that some DIY yogurt instructions mention that if you ferment longer and/or in warm temperatre the more sour it will be so to reduce how sour it is, either ferment it less and/or start fermentation at a lower temperature <a href=""http://nourishedkitchen.com/troubleshooting-homemade-yogurt-questions/"">(source)</a>.</p>

"How did the cardiovascular system evolve?","6196","","<p>How has evolution created our blood, lungs and the heart?</p>

<p>We can't exist without blood, which transports the oxygen to all areas of our body. However, the blood needs a lung, which gives it the oxygen to transport. The blood also needs something which lets it flow through the whole body, which are our veins. And in order to allow the blood to flow through our veins, an organ is needed to pump the blood, which is our heart. We also need a brain which controls all that, and the brain in turn needs the blood in order to function right.</p>

<p>Evolution makes very slow steps.....""it just doesn't jump"". So, How did evolution manage to create all that?</p>
","<p>While others have addressed the big picture aspects of your question, I think it would be useful to look at the specifics. </p>

<p>Have a look at the heart (or more accurately, the <em>hearts</em>) of the earthworm: <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VD1up.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VD1up.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>They're nothing more than veins with some pumping muscles wrapped around them. It seems almost a stretch to call them hearts, they are shaped so different from what we think of as a heart proper.</p>

<p>Also, note the earthworm's lungs, or rather, lack of them. It doesn't have any! Why not? It doesn't need them. It gets enough oxygen through its skin via osmosis. It's only larger organisms that need dedicated systems to concentrate oxygen from the surrounding environment.</p>

<p>So, the worm has a simpler system (no chambered heart, no lungs) that works.</p>

<p>All vertebrates descended from a common ancestor that was very similar to this earthworm. It had simple hearts, and no lungs. You can follow the evolution of the human heart through fish heart: <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yZuoB.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yZuoB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>which is a more sophisticated pumping vessel with two chambers.</p>

<p>Amphibians evolved from fish, reptiles from amphibians, and mammals from reptiles. In this diagram, you will find that the heart becomes more sophisticated and efficient in each:

<p>So, this should give you a good idea of the evolution of the human heart from simpler, working system. I won't take the time to draw out the evolution of blood vessels or lungs; maybe someone else will, or you can google them yourself, the information is readily out there. But they all follow the same pattern: gradual, incremental improvements on working, simpler systems. </p>

"Can more than one antibody bind the same antigen","6189","","<p>I'd like to clear something up about antibodies that I'm not sure I've understood in the articles I've read. Looking at concepts such as ""affinity maturation"", ""monovalent antigens"" and ""polyvalent antigens"" it seems as if there are multiple antibodies which can bind to the same antigen. (Although I think I'm right in saying that individual antibodies can only bind to one antigen?) However, when I read sentences like ""It has been estimated that humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen"" on the Wikipedia page (for antibody) it does make it sound like it's one antibody per antigen? Is this the case? Or is it one antibody per epitope. Either way, to put this question in a nutshell:</p>

<p>Is it true to say that the same substance could bind with (and, therefore, be recognised by) more than one antibody, or not?</p>

<p>Also, if the answer is no, does that mean that antibodies with different binding affinities are classed as the same antibody or not?</p>
","<p>Let's clarify the terms. An <em>antigen</em> is a molecule that can be associated with a particular substance (virus, pollen, dander.) When an immunoglobulin or <em>antibody</em> recognizes an antigen it binds to a specific <em>epitope</em>. An antibody recognizes an epitope using its <em>paratope</em>.</p>

<p>Some antigens have multiple epitopes; this means that different antibodies can simultaneously bind to them (if the epitopes are far-enough apart from each other so that binding to one doesn't preclude binding to the others.) </p>

<p>An example from my work is influenza (flu) hemagglutinin, which is a major viral coat protein. <a href=""http://pdbj.org/emnavi/emnavi_detail.php?id=5731"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's a low-resolution structure showing a ""head-binding"" antibody fragment (actually three of them)</a>, and <a href=""http://pdbj.org/emnavi/emnavi_detail.php?id=5794"" rel=""nofollow"">here's a similar structure showing a ""stem-binding"" antibody fragment</a>. Our immune repertoire (and physiology) greatly predisposes us towards producing head-binding antibodies over stem-binders. Note that each structure has three antibody fragments bound in the same state. Because the head-binder and stem-binder antibodies are well-separated in space they can both be accommodated in a single complex (as is experimentally confirmed.) In this case, up to six antibodies, using two distinct paratopes, could simultaneously bind to a single antigen.</p>

<p>For matured (high affinity and high specificity) antibodies, each binds a specific epitope. The typical state of affairs is then explained ""one antibody per epitope"" which is overly simplistic because some epitopes can be recognized by multiple paratopes (which would be found on different antibodies.) So a given epitope can be recognized by no antibodies (a new antigen, or one that is poorly immunogenic) or by multiple ones.</p>

"What is the criticality of the ribosome binding site relative to the start codon in prokaryotic translation?","6185","","<p>In prokaryotic translation, how critical for efficient translation is the location of the ribosome binding site, relative to the start codon?</p>

<p>Ideally, it is supposed to be -7b away from the start. How about if it is -9 bases away or even more? Will this have an observable effect on translation?</p>
","<p>I found an oldish paper on this topic (from 1994).  Here's a summary:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC523762/"">Determination of the optimal aligned spacing between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the translation initiation codon of Escherichia coli mRNAs.</a> by Chen, Bjerknes, Kumar, &amp; Jay. Nucleic Acids Research. (1994)</p>

<p><strong>Experiment</strong></p>

<p>The authors constructed a series of synthetic RBS regions that varied the length separating a synthetic 5-nt Shine-Dalgarno sequence from the start codon.  The regions varied in size between 2 to 17 nt.  They assayed the activity of a downstream enzyme, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>

<p>The authors concluded that the optimal spacing between a consensus 5-nt Shine-Dalgarno sequence (5'-GAGGT-3') and the start site <strong>was 5 nt</strong>. Note: this synthetic SD was made of the <em>last</em> 5 nt of a 9 nt SD consensus sequence.  They also tested a synthetic SD made from the <em>first</em> 5 nt (5'-TAAGG-3')of the consensus SD.  In this case they found the optimal distance was <strong>9 nt</strong>.</p>

<p>So the optimal distance depends on where your desired SD aligns with the consensus SD sequence, which optimally is <strong>5 nt</strong> from the start.  Read on for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>the RBS is considered to be large, extending 20bp on either side of a core Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence.  These days, I often hear of the RBS spoken of in sizes that are equivalent to the SD.  So in the parlance of the paper, you question is rephrased as ""how does distance of the SD from the start codon effect translation?""</p></li>
<li><p>the canonical SD sequence referenced in the paper is 5'-UAAGGAGGU-3'.  It is 9 nucleotides long.  Distances between the SD and the start codon are defined as the number of nucleotides separate the 3' Uracil of the SD from the Adenine of the start AUG.</p></li>
<li><p>Example: the distance is 5 nt in the following mRNA</p>

<pre><code>       5'.....UAAGGAGGUnnnnnAUG......3'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>if the SD is not a complete 9 nt long, the distance is between the position of where the canonical Uracil <em>would</em> occur.  In the following example, the distance is still calculated as 5 nt:</p>

<pre><code>       5'.....UAAGGAnnnnnnnnAUG......3'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>the average distance between the SD sequence and the start codon varies considerably and on average is 7 nt. Other investigators have found ""optimal"" spacing (circa 1994) ranged from 5 to 13 nt.</p></li>
<li><p>the SD site complements with region on the 16s rRNA. The start codon complements to the anticodon of fMet-tRNA loaded into the ribosomal P-site.  So there are two distinct sites on the ribosome that contact the mRNA during translation initiation.</p></li>

","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Shedding or reabsorbing the endometrial lining is energetically advantageous to the female.The advantage of shedding over re-absorption <em>may be</em> that sperm-born pathogens are removed from the uterus. A more parsimonious explanation, however, is that the endometrium in primates has developed into too large of a structure to be completely reabsorbed by the uterus wall.   </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Basically you ask <strong>why are estrous cycles in mammals accompanied by regression and build up of the endometrial lining</strong>? The main reason for either reabsorbing or shedding the endometrial lining is thought to be to <strong>save energy</strong>. It has been calculated that, when implantation fails, a cyclical regression and renewal of the endometrium is <strong>energetically less costly</strong> than maintaining it in a metabolically active state required for implantation. In the regressed state, oxygen consumption in human endometria declines nearly sevenfold. Metabolic rate is at least 7% lower, on average, during the follicular phase than during the luteal phase in women, which signifies an estimated energy savings of 53 MJ over four cycles, or nearly six days worth of food <a href=""http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/419369"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Strassmann, 1996</a>; <a href=""https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Evolutionary-Psychology-Ideas-Issues-and-Applications/Crawford-Krebs/p/book/9780203763889"" rel=""noreferrer"">Crawford, 1998)</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, impaired shedding of the endometrial lining may lead to pathologies. If no egg is released and the estrogen/progesterone system becomes imbalanced, the endometrium may continue to thicken, instead of breaking down and being shed normally as a menstrual period. This abnormal thickening is called <em>endometrial hyperplasia</em>. Periodically, the thickened lining is shed incompletely and irregularly, causing irregular and more heavy bleeding. If this cycle of abnormal thickening and irregular shedding continues, precancerous cells may develop, increasing the <strong>risk of cancer</strong> of the uterine lining (endometrial cancer), even in young women (source: <a href=""http://www.msdmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/menstrual-disorders-and-abnormal-vaginal-bleeding/dysfunctional-uterine-bleeding"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSD manual</a>).</p>

<p>Now the question of why human females shed the endometrial lining instead of resorbing it? Indeed, shedding the endometrium is mainly limited to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation_(mammal)"" rel=""noreferrer"">primates</a>, as opposed to reabsorbing it (like in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation_(mammal)"" rel=""noreferrer"">most other mammals</a>). Here, I do not have a definitive answer, but I like to share two opposing hypothesis on the matter.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hypothesis 1</strong>:  <a href=""http://www.conovers.org/ftp/Menstruation.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Profet (1993)</a> hypothesized that shedding the endometrium may be an effective way to get rid of sperm-based pathogens. The accompanying bleeding, Profet hypothesizes, delivers immune cells into the uterine cavity that can combat pathogens. </li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis 2</strong>: <a href=""http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/419369"" rel=""noreferrer"">Strassmann (1996)</a> surmises that the endometrial microvasculature is designed to provide the blood supply to the endometrium and the placenta, and that external bleeding appears to be a side effect of endometrial regression that arises when there is too much blood and other tissue for complete reabsorption. The relatively large blood loss as seen in humans and chimpanzees can be attributed to the large size of the uterus relative to adult female size and to the design of the microvasculature in the uterus wall. </li>
</ul>

","<p>I found an interesting article in Scientific American (<a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-most-species-have/"">Coates, 2005</a>), and I quote part of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The condition of having no more than five fingers or toes [...] probably evolved before the evolutionary divergence of amphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders and caecilians) and amniotes (birds, mammals, and reptiles in the loosest sense of the term). This event dates to approximately 340 million years ago in the Lower Carboniferous Period. Prior to this split, there is evidence of tetrapods from about 360 million years ago having limbs bearing arrays of six, seven and eight digits. Reduction from these polydactylous patterns to the more familiar arrangements of five or fewer digits accompanied the evolution of sophisticated wrist and ankle joints--both in terms of the number of bones present and the complex articulations among the constituent parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Coates states that <strong>around 360 million years ago there were tetrapods with more digits</strong> (6, 7, 8), but that <strong>this was reduced to 5 about 340 million years ago</strong>.

<p>Is this a trivial observation or something inherent in the neuro-synapse or muscular make-up of these animals?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/p9aPR.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/p9aPR.png"" alt=""Bikke the Chipmunk Yawning and Stretching""></a></p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Intermittent locomotion can <em>increase the detection of prey</em> by predators (e.g.  rats), while it may lead to <em>reduced attack rates</em> in prey animals (e.g., rats and chipmunks). It may also <em>increase physical endurance</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Rather than moving continuously through the environment, many animals interrupt their locomotion with frequent brief pauses. Pauses increase the time required to travel a given distance and add costs of acceleration and deceleration to the
energetic cost of locomotion. From an adaptation perspective, pausing should provide benefits that outweigh these costs <a href=""http://www.uoguelph.ca/~amclab/amclab/Publications_files/McAdam%26Kramer.98.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Adam &amp; kramer, 1998)</a>.</p>

<p>One potential benefit of pausing is <strong>increased detection of prey</strong> by predators. Slower movement speeds likely improve prey detection by providing more time to
scan a given visual field. </p>

<p>A second plausible benefit is <strong>reduced attack rate</strong> by predators. Many predators are more likely to attack moving prey, perhaps because such prey is more easily detected or recognized. Indeed, motionlessness (‘freezing’) is a widespread
response by prey that detect a predator.</p>

<p>A third benefit may be <strong>increased endurance</strong>. For animals moving faster than their aerobically sustainable speeds, the maximum distance run can be increased by taking pauses. These pauses allow the clearance of lactate from the muscles through aerobic mechanisms. </p>

<p>PS: If you mean with 'snappy' not only that small animals move intermittently, but also 'fast', then Remi.b's answers nicely covers the story why small critters are quick. Basically, it comes down to <a href=""http://physics.info/newton-second/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Newton's second law</a>, namely acceleration is inversely proportional to mass (<a href=""http://zonalandeducation.com/mstm/physics/mechanics/forces/newton/newtonLaw2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a = F/m</a>), <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1116/why-is-it-that-cats-can-jump-so-high-for-their-size-compared-with-humans"">but the size of muscle power is not</a>. Hence, bigger animals have more mass and need a lot more force to build up to accelerate at the same speed. That build up of force needs time (ever witnessed the vertical lift-off of a space shuttle?) Hence, small critters accelerate quicker and allow them to move 'snappy'.    </p>

"Why can't we see in low light if staring long enough?","6098","","<p>For me it seems reasonable that if I kept my gaze on a fixed point in a room with low light, a progressively brighter and better picture would appear before my eyes, just like a camera can see in the dark if the shutter speed is really slow, e.g. 4 seconds exposure. Why can't our brain do this trick as well (accumulate visual information over time)? Or is it a limitation of the eyes?</p>

<p><em>edit:</em></p>

<p>To further clarify what I'm after; I will show a concrete example from the world of photography (images taken from <a href=""http://www.media-division.com/photoshop-tricks-solving-common-photography-problems-using-image-stacks/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this website</a>).</p>

<p>Here is an example where we have a series of underexposed images - this would be what the brain receives:

<p>This seems like a simple trick for our powerful brain - surely it can add incoming signals?</p>
","<p>For simplicity's sake, let's really reduce this to something like photography.</p>

<p>A camera's aperture can stay open indefinitely, allowing the plate (or whatever is receiving and recording light) to ""collect and save the effect of photons"" over time, if you want to phrase it that way. That allows a camera to make images that our eyes never can, for example, of ""star trails"".</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f2p2d.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f2p2d.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The retina isn't like a photographic plate or a digital sensor's <em>photosites</em> (or pixels). It can't ""collect and save"" like a camera can. There is a ""refresh rate"", if you will, that disallows a collection and saving of light that doesn't apply to cameras, because cameras don't care if something in their vicinity is sneaking up on them and presenting a danger to their lives. Not being able to detect <strong>change</strong> rapidly is something that would be most inconvenient to survival.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the time sampling with long exposures that really makes the magic of digital astrophotography possible. A digital sensor's true power comes from its ability to integrate, or collect, photons over much longer time periods than the eye. This is why we can record details in long exposures that are invisible to the eye, even through a large telescope.</p>

"How does plant grafting work?","6066","","<p>Plant <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting"">grafting</a> is a process whereby a piece of one plant is inserted into another and results in a change of the original plant. For example, grafting a piece of a lemon tree into a bitter orange tree will cause that tree to produce lemons instead of oranges for the rest of its life.</p>

<p>How does this work? I mean, at the genetic level. I guess the grafted plant is now a chimera of some sort but if so</p>

<li><p>Is it perhaps that the host DNA is not affected at all and the effects come via a change in expression levels? If that is the case I would assume grafting will only work between very closely related species. Is that so?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Basically I know very little about plant genetics and physiology. I remember from my undergraduate days that plant genetics are just plain weird. Most, if not all, have various levels of polyploidy. Is that relevant?</p>

<p>Quoting from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the grafted tissues fuse and establish vascular connections,
  the stock (the lower part of the graft) and scion (the upper part,
  usually supplying solely aerial parts to the graft) are thought not to
  exchange their genetic materials. But grafting (whether natural or
  assisted) provides a path for horizontal gene transfer. Gene transfer
  is confined to the graft site and no long-distance transfer may occur.
  Analyzes indicating that large DNA pieces or even entire plastid
  genomes are transferred. Only plastid genes may be transferred, no
  transfer of nuclear genes occur. Plant cells are connected via
  plasmatic bridges called plasmodesmata, but the passage of large
  macromolecules requires the action of specific plasmodesmata-widening
  proteins. Whether large DNA pieces or even entire organelles can
  travel through plasmodesmata requires further investigation.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, although our data demonstrate the exchange of genetic
  material between grafted plants, they do not lend support to the tenet
  of Lysenkoism that “graft hybridization” would be analogous to sexual
  hybridization. Instead, our finding that gene transfer is restricted
  to the contact zone between scion and stock indicates that the changes
  can become heritable only via lateral shoot formation from the graft
  site. However, there is some reported evidence for heritable
  alterations induced by grafting and, in light of our findings,
  these cases certainly warrant detailed molecular investigation.</p>

The influx of Ca2+ is at start of Phase 2, so Phase 0 and 1 are included in the latent period.</p>

<p>Comparing to <strong>electrocardiogram</strong> is not simple, since there is always at least some time lag between the event and the recording.

<ol>
<li>An action potential is initiated by pacemaker cells in the Sinoatrial node or Atrioventricular node and conducted to all cells in the heart via gap junctions.</li>
<li>The action potential travels along the surface membrane into T-tubules (the latter are not seen in all cardiac cell types) and the depolarisation causes Ca2+
to enter the cell via L-type calcium channels (also known as Dihydropyridine receptors) and possibly sodium-calcium exchanger during the early part of the plateau phase. This Ca2+
influx causes a small local increase in intracellular Ca2+
.</li>
<li>The increase in Ca2+
is detected by ryanodine receptors in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum which releases Ca2+
in a positive feedback physiological response. This positive feedback is known as calcium-induced calcium release and gives rise to Calcium sparks.</li>
<li>The spatial and temporal summation of ~30,000 Ca2+
sparks gives a cell-wide increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration.</li>
<li>Contractile mechanism similar as in skeletal muscle about cytoplasmic calcium binding to troponin C and so on. </li>

"What are the function(s) of Alu elements in the cell?","6059","","<p>My 2008 biology book (1) states that some 10% of the human genome consists of relatively short (~300 nucleotides long) <em>Alu</em> elements which do not code for proteins but many of which are transcribed into RNA. Do these <em>Alu</em> elements have any function in the cell?</p>

<p><strong>(1) Biology, 8th ed., Campbell &amp; Reece, 2008</strong></p>
","<p>Alu elements are a type of transposable element. They possess the means for their own duplication and movement.  Alu is a SINE-like element that is transcribed by RNA Pol III, and so a single DNA copy can make multiple RNA copies, each capable of inserting into DNA, so it's no wonder they have a very high copy number.  Here is a picture of one means of insertion <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v3/n5/box/nrg798_BX1.html"">http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v3/n5/box/nrg798_BX1.html</a>, although there are likely others.</p>

<p>They do not have ""a function"" per se, in that they are not selected for, they are just rarely selected against and there are so many of them.  They do not add functionality, but rather are one half of the ""war"" between transposable elements and viruses versus the genome's evolution to mitigate the damage they cause.  They are, of course, commonly used as sources of new DNA for sequence evolution, or can be used to create transpositions or other chromosome rearrangements, but mostly they just fail to cause too much damage and so tend to accumulate in the genome.</p>

However I don't understand how they work differently or why they work separately. I would be very grateful if someone could explain the seperate roles and functions of these two hormones and also the different effects that they have (I believe cortisol also has something to do with promoting lypogenesis in adipose tissue at the trunk of the body and lypolysis at the extremities).</p>
","<p>Glucagon and cortisol are <strong>VERY</strong> different types of hormones, though each of them can affect glucose metabolism and effectively can increase glucose concentrations in the blood (albeit through different mechanisms).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GJxSe.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GJxSe.gif"" alt=""Glucagon Peptide""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Glucagon</a>, pictured above, is a 31 amino acid peptide hormone (i.e. PROTEIN) that is released from the alpha-cells within the pancreatic islets. Glucagon travels through the blood and acts predominately in the liver on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon_receptor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glucagon receptors</a>. The glucagon peptide binds to the glucagon receptor on the OUTSIDE of the cell and transmits a signal to the INSIDE of the cell. This occurs when the glucagon binds to the receptor, changing its conformation or ""shape"" on the inside of the cell, which then causes binding and activation of a G-protein inside the cell ($G_S$). This $G_S$ protein activates an enzyme within the cell (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">adenylyl cyclase</a>) to increase the concentration of a substance called cyclic AMP (aka <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cAMP</a>) that activates a number of enzymes that ultimately increase the amount of glucose released by the liver. These effects are IMMEDIATE effects, which is why we sometimes give glucagon injections to treat patients with hypoglycemia (i.e. dangerously low blood sugar concentration). However, sustained glucagon signaling likely has effects on the expression of the enzymes that cause the glucose to be released from the liver as well (though that is a discussion for another question). </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L1gV6.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L1gV6.png"" alt=""Cortisol""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cortisol</a>, pictured above, is a steroid hormone (i.e. LIPID) that is released from the adrenal glands, specifically the <em>zona fasciulata</em>, which is the middle of the three 'layers' of the adrenal gland. Cortisol is referred to as a <em>glucocorticoid</em> and exerts its major effects through changing gene transcription in a variety of cell types. The way that cortisol does this is by binding its cortisol receptor, which is generally thought to be in the cytoplasm inside the cell. Upon binding of cortisol to the cortisol receptor, that complex is then transported into the nucleus of the cell where it binds DNA and can increase or decrease the transcription or expression of target genes. In the case of cortisol, these genes are for the enzymes that increase glucose production of the liver, and thus increase the body's capacity to maintain or elevate blood glucose. There is also some evidence that cortisol has additional effects independent of gene transcription, but that is outside the scope of this question. Regardless, the effects of cortisol on glucose metabolism are not immediate, but rather they take >30 minutes to several hours to begin to take effect. </p>

<p>As mentioned in the question, both glucagon and cortisol affect glucose metabolism. Cortisol also affects the transcription of a number of genes involved in adipose tissue and lipid metabolism, as well as genes that are involved in protein metabolism and inflammation. Cortisol can be injected into a patient with an autoimmune ""flare-up"" in order to quell the inflammation, but those are different mechanisms of cortisol than its effects on glucose metabolism. A description of those effects is also outside the scope of this question, but could easily be read about in recent reviews on cortisol available on PubMed, e.g. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26241028"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Recent Cortisol and Fatty Liver Review</a>.</p>

"Definition of ""Effective population size""","6037","","<p>Could you explain to me, what is the meaning of ""<em>Effective population size ($N_e$)</em>""?</p>

<p>I would appreciate an example as well.</p>
","<p>I'll add an informal answer to complement @Remi.b's excellent answer. In a very simple sense, you can think of the effective population size as the number of reproducing (breeding) individuals in a population. Nature Education has a very good (and free) Scitable article on <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genetic-drift-and-effective-population-size-772523"">Genetic Drift and Effective Population Size</a>. The article makes four points, which I've annotated below.</p>

<ul>
<li>The population has an equal number of males and females. All
individuals are able to reproduce.</li>
</ul>

<p>Populations of many species contain individuals that have not yet reached sexual maturity, have passed an age of reproductive capability, or might have a genetic condition that prevents reproduction.  All of these individuals count towards the census population size (actual number of individuals present) but not count towards effective population size because they can't reproduce.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All individuals in the population are equally likely to reproduce. </p></li>
<li><p>Mating is random.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not all indivduals (assuming individuals that meet assumption #1 above) are equally likely to reproduce. For example, the process of <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/sexual-selection-13255240"">sexual selection</a> means that some individuals are much more likely to reproduce than other individuals. Sexual selection is not random, and lowers effective population size. </p>

<ul>
<li>The number of breeding individuals is constant from one generation to
the next.</li>
</ul>

<p>Population sizes for some species can fluctuate over many generations. For example, freshwater mussels have declined rapidly in population size due to habitat loss and other factors. Nearly 72% of the species in the United State and Canada are endangered, threatened or of conservation concern (<a href=""http://fishwild.vt.edu/mussel/PDFfiles/Conservation_status.pdf"">Williams et al. 1993</a>). The population sizes for the majority of mussels species are but a fraction of what they once were. This is the case for many endangered species. This too lowers effective population size.</p>

<p>Here's a simple mathematical treatment to highlight points 1-3. Consider a population of zebras. Zebras like the Plains Zebra (<em>Equus quagga</em>) form harems where one male mates with several females. He prevents other males from mating with the females in his harem. Let's make the following assumptions: 1) the population has 250 males and 250 females, all capable of breeding and 2) each male that is able to form a harem gets five females. If so, then only 50 males will actually get to reproduce. The census size is 500 individuals but the effective population size, as shown in Remi.b's answer, is calculate by</p>

<p>$$N_e = \frac{4N_m N_f}{N_m+N_F}$$</p>

<p>where, $N_e$ is the effective population size, $N_m$ is the number of breeding males and $N_f$ is the number of breeding females. Given assumptions 1 and 2 above, $N_m$ is 50 and $N_f$ is 250 (50 males $\times$ 5 females each). Therefore,</p>

<p>$$N_e = \frac{4\times 50 \times 250}{50 + 250} = 166.67$$</p>

<p>Clearly, the effective population size is much smaller than the census population size.</p>

  <p>During oocyte–sperm fusion and second polar body expulsion, the cytoplasmic contents of the sperm cell membrane (now fused with the oocyte membrane) pass into the oocyte cytoplasm. Between 4 and 7h after fusion, the two sets of haploid chromosomes each become surrounded by distinct mem- branes and are now known as pronuclei (see Fig. d). The male is usually the larger of the two. Both pronuclei contain several nucleoli. During the next few hours, each pronucleus gradually moves from its subcortical position to a more central and adjacent cytoplasmic position. During this period, the haploid chromosomes synthesize DNA in preparation for the first mitotic division, which occursabout 18–24h after gamete fusion. The pronuclear membranes around the reduplicated sets of parental chromo- somes break down (see Fig. e), the mitotic metaphase spindle forms and the chromosomes assume their positions at its equator. The final phase of fertilization has been achieved: syngamy (or coming together of the gametic chromosomes) has occurred.

<p>I would consider it quite hard to hit the aiways like that though, the bullet would have to enter the chest quite near the centre as the cough reflex is not triggered by substances in the lung itself, only in the airways.

"On the genetics behind caste marriages","5983","","<p>I am in India where it is typically a custom to marry within one's caste. Basically the caste system originated with roots in people's professions - Each of priests, carpenters, troupers, etc had a caste of their own. My question is based on the genetic basis of marriages performed within one's caste.</p>

<ul>
<li>I know the concept of alleles where there is a dominant allele and a recessive one, like the A and O resp. in blood groups and Rh+ and Rh- in Rhesus factors. Is there a similar genetic information based on our ancestral profession in our chromosomes? Is the son of a couple engaged in farming better suited to the same profession unless he receives a couple of recessive alleles from both parents?</li>
<li>Generally there is a lot of unscientific information floating around about these matters. One of the grapevines is that it is genetically better for one to marry outside their caste to create diversity(?). Is such a thing true? </li>
</ul>

<p>If genetics or biology have any role to play in these fields, I will be happy to know and learn.</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not everything is coded in the genome, environmental cues play a very important role in shaping who you are. Profession is just one of those things that is not encoded in genes.
Many people do not continue doing the job of their parents, but they do very well in life.
Also note that, aside from the fact that there is no ""agriculture"" gene, having a recessive allele does not mean you will miss a certain phenotype.
What is true is that someone who has higher education will probably be more keen to have their kids studying. On the contrary, the kids of someone who is a poor farmer and is barely able to provide for his family will probably not have the opportunity of going to school (let alone university) and therefore will continue to work the land. It has nothing to do with genetics.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Continuing to reproduce in the same group of people will limit diversity in the genome, and create an accumulation of mutations, which is generally a bad thing. That is why it is very common to have particular illnesses in closed communities.</p>

<p>For instance Amish people have an higher incidence of genetic disorders such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis%E2%80%93van_Creveld_syndrome"">Ellis-van Creveld syndrome</a> (a form of dwarfism)</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8661097"">The Gene for the Ellis–van Creveld Syndrome Is Located on Chromosome 4p16</a> - Ruiz-Perez et al., Nat. Genetics 2000</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Autosomal recessive transmission of the disorder is supported by
  multiple affected siblings with unaffected parents in families with
  known parental consanguinity. The largest known pedigree segregating
  with EVC is that reported by McKusick and his colleagues in the Old
  Order Amish (McKusick et al., 1964). The prevalence of living persons
  affected with EVC among the Lancaster County Amish was estimated to be
  2 in 1000, whereas the frequency of occurrence among live births was 5
  in 1000. McKusick et al. estimated that the frequency of heterozygous
  carriers in the Old Order Amish is as high as 13% (McKusick et al.,
  1964). All cases of EVC in the Amish at that time were traced to a
  common founding couple, Samuel King and his wife, who immigrated to
  Pennsylvania in 1744.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a well known effect, called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect"">founder effect</a>.</p>

<p>As for India, a study on the genetic behind casts has been done a couple of years ago. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842210/"">Reconstructing Indian Population History</a> - Reich et al., Nature 2010</p>

<p>From the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Haldane wrote 45 years ago that “if inter-caste marriages in India become common, various… recessive characters will become rarer”. However, it has not been generally appreciated that this applies to groups throughout India, and not only to groups in the south where consanguinity is common. We hypothesize that founder effects are responsible for an even higher burden of recessive diseases in India than consanguinity. 
  To test this hypothesis, we used our data to estimate the probability that two alleles from a group share a common ancestor more recently than that group’s divergence from other Indians, and compared this to the probability that an individual’s two alleles share an ancestor in the last few generations due to consanguinity. <strong>Nine of the 15 Indian groups for which we could make this assessment had a higher probability of recessive disease due to founder events than to consanguinity, including all the Indo-European speaking groups.</strong>
  An additional reason why some diseases are expected to occur at elevated frequencies in India is shared descent from a common Indian ancestral population. An example is a 25 base pair deletion in MYBPC3 that increases heart failure risk by about 7-fold, and occurs at around 4% throughout India but is nearly absent elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They conclude that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have documented a high level of population substructure in India, and have shown that the model of mixture between two ancestral populations ASI and ANI provides an excellent description of genetic variation in many Indian groups. 
  [...]<br>
  By showing that a large proportion of Indian groups descend from strong founder events, these results highlight the importance of identifying recessive diseases in these groups and mapping causal genes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is very important to understand that this results in no way show a genetic basis for the existence of casts, which remain purely social entities. They rather show that an <strong>environmental</strong> constraint can influence the distribution of genetic traits, due to a restriction in the possibility of mixing genes in the population.</p>

"What is an irreversible reaction?","5973","","<p>There are reactions with large Delta G negative values. Why these reactions are irreversible? As in: out of 10 steps of Glycolysis, 3 are irreversible steps. I need an explanation for why they are irreversible.</p>
","<p>The term ""irreversible"" means that the reverse reaction occurs so rarely that it is considered negligible. This means that you do not have to consider equilibrium, as you have to for reversible reactions. Instead, you can assume that all of the reactants will eventually become product.</p>

<p>As you stated, this is true for reactions that have a very negative Gibbs free energy.  Remember the formulation of the Gibbs free energy in terms of the equilibrium constant:<br>
$$
\Delta G^o =  -RTln(K)
$$</p>

<p>This can be rewritten as follows:
$$
K = e^{-\Delta G^o/RT}
$$</p>

<p>As $\Delta G^o$ gets very negative, you can see that $K$ gets very positive.</p>

<p>The equlibrium constant has two definitions that are both useful. First, it is the ratio of the products to the reactants. Therefore as $K$ gets very positive, the equilibrium ratio of products to reactants approaches infinity, implying that all of the reactants will be consumed.</p>

<p>More useful is the definition of the equilibrium constant as the ratio of the rates of the forward and reverse reaction. From this definition we can see that as $K$ gets very large, the ratio of the rates of the forward and reverse reaction approaches infinity. This means that <em>the rate of the reverse reaction becomes negligible compared to the rate of the forward reaction.</em> This is exactly what it means to be irreversible.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to make (what I think is) a more convincing argument using the concept of activation energy, using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond%27s_postulate"">Hammond's Postulate</a> to describe the character of the transition state. If you'd like, I can write this out. However, I think the argument given above is more easily understood with a basic chemistry background.</p>

"What fruits will naturally ferment?","5970","","<p>If left unpicked after the fruit ripens, what fruits may ferment instead of just rotting? My perception is that most fruits just rot. </p>

<p>I know figs will ferment. I'm guessing that this is because the wasp that pollinates the fig carries yeast inside what will become the fruit. </p>

<p>Eating ferment figs got me thinking about how humans first discovered ethanol. I'd guess that they ate ferment fruit and fiddled around until they could reproduce the process. </p>
","<p>First, before talking about fruits, let's remember that <em>fermentation</em> is an energetic metabolic process where there is no net oxidation of the substract. Bacteria, fungi, animals like you and me and even plants can use fermentation in different occasions. Plant cells, like fungal cells (and unlike bacteria and animal cells) perform alcoholic fermentation. So, there is no need of a fungal contamination to make a plant tissue producing ethanol.</p>

<p>But, of course, the presence of fermenting fungi, particularly yeasts, can make alcoholic fermentation much faster and noticeable. Several fruits contain what is called ""ambient yeasts"" (differing from ""cultured yeasts"", which we add to the fruits latter) covering them, and I believe the most famous example are grapes. Grapes are covered by several genera of Ascomycota (like <em>Candida</em> and <em>Pichia</em>), which can lead to alcoholic fermentation of the fruit. These species are different from <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, the most common ""cultured yeast"" (and the one used in winemaking), but they can produce ethanol the same way. </p>

<p>This ""natural fermentation"" of grapes is known for a very long time, and it's probably one of the first cases of natural alcoholic fermentation known by civilized man.</p>

"Is there any use of CO₂ in human body?","5967","","<p>We all know CO₂ as a waste product of metabolism . Does CO₂ have any helpful role , apart from having a role in pH of blood ?</p>
","<p>Before I restrict the answer to human metabolism, I recon it is important to mention that 
CO<sub>2</sub> is the source of the carbon atoms of glucose in photosynthesis (in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-independent_reactions"">Calvin cycle</a>). [In photosynthesis CO<sub>2</sub> is 'fixed']. </p>

<p>Even with the above restriction, I am certain I  cannnot do justice to every helpful aspect of CO<sub>2</sub> in mammalian metabolism, and I'll restrict myself to just one area that came to mind on reading your question: the requirement for carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate) for fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) and, in a bit more general sense, mammalian/bacterial biotin-dependent carboxylation reactions. Depeding on other contributions, I might be able to extend this a bit later. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.jbc.org/content/281/5/e5"">Salih Wakil</a> showed that CO<sub>2</sub> is an absolute requiement for fatty acid biosynthesis, but <strong>carbon atoms from CO<sub>2</sub> do not appear in the fatty acid product</strong>.</p>

<p>We now know that FAS begins with the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetyl-CoA_carboxylase"">acetyl-CoA carboxylase</a>. Acetyl-CoA, ATP and <strong>bicarbonate</strong> are the substrates for this enzyme, and malonyl-CoA is a key product. One of the many interesting properties of this enzyme is that it contains <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin"">biotin</a>, which (in this case) may be considered a carrier of 'active' CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>This explains the requriement for carbon dioxide but why no carbon from CO<sub>2</sub> in the final product? </p>

<p>It is now known that in subsequent FAS reactions, a derivative of malonyl-CoA condenses with a derivative of acetyl-CoA (I am simplifying here) to give a four-carbon compound with loss of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Thus, carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate) is an obligate requiement for mammalian fatty acid biosynthesis, but no CO<sub>2</sub>-derived carbon is incorporated into fatty acids.  </p>

<p>Carbon dioxide is also required for oxaloacetate formation from pyruvate. This reaction may be though of a method of 'filling up' a key <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle"">Krebs Cycle</a> intermediate (a  so-called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplerotic_reactions"">anapleurotic</a> reaction).  The enzyme here is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvate_carboxylase"">pyruvate carboxylase</a> and the substrates for the reaction are pyruvate, <strong>bicarbonate</strong> and ATP, with oxaloacetate being a key product.  This enzyme also contains biotin and (like acetyl CoA carboxylase), CO<sub>2</sub> becomes covalently bound to biotin during the reaction cycle.  </p>

<p>Pyruvate-CoA carboxylase was discovered by <a href=""http://www.jbc.org/content/280/18/e15.full?sid=2034e625-3271-4210-a544-03b531e655af"">Harland.G Wood</a> and C. Werkman in bacteria (See <a href=""http://www.jbc.org/content/238/8/2603.full.pdf"">here</a> for a good reference on the early work on pyruvate carboxylase). Its discovery was very controversial because at the time it was thought that animal/bacterial cells could not 'fix' CO<sub>2</sub>; that is it was though that CO<sub>2</sub> is only 'fixed' in photosynthesis.  This discovery disproved that piece of dogmatism. </p>

<p>A third enzyme that requires CO<sub>2</sub>  as substrate (in the form of bicarbonate) is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propionyl-CoA_carboxylase"">propionyl-CoA carboxylase</a>.  This enzyme occurs in mitochondria and functions in odd-chain fatty acid metabolism.  It also <strong>contains biotin</strong>.</p>

<p>I have concentrated on some biochemical aspects of your question.  The three enzymes mentioned, acety-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase and propionyl-CoA carboxylase all require CO<sub>2</sub> in the form of bicarbonate as substrate, <strong>all contain biotin</strong>, and (as far as I am aware) all play very central roles in mammalian metabolism.  (They also all require ATP as substrate).  </p>

<p>Of the many interesting aspects of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin"">biotin</a>, I'll mention just one.  Egg white contains a protein, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidin"">avidin</a>, which binds biotin very, very tightly.  In fact the biotin-avidin interaction is one of the strongest non-covalent interactions known.  As far as I am aware, no-one knows the function of avidin in egg white.  Some bacteria contain a similar  (but evolutionarily unrelated) protein called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptavidin"">streptavidin</a>. No one knows the function of steptavidin either (again, as far as I am aware). </p>

<p>Anyhow; two hikers gets attacked by a grizzly bear and whilst one get killed the other manages to throw himself off a cliff and ending up with his leg pinched under a rock. He also has big lacerations on his chest from the grizzly. Finally he manages to send a distress signal.</p>

<p>Though not licensed a team travels out to asses the situation. As they find the wounded climber they start to help. First they clean the lacerations by pouring alcohol over them, and then lay some bandages on top. After a while the injured man complains he is thirsty, and they give him water.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>TLDR;/Question</em></strong> If I recall correctly one should <em>not</em> give water to a trauma patient. They can have internal bleeding and/or, as in this case big external wounds which likely has caused quite some blood loss.</p>

<p>Liquid will, IIRC, cause some bad effect on the re-production on blood, and might also affect existing blood.</p>

<p>Am I correct in this? If so; <strong><em>what happens and why should one not give liquid to the patient?</em></strong></p>

<p>Guess there could be some situations where liquid is proper. E.g. patient has been laying in exposure to sun for N hours and dehydration might also cause ill effects... ? (Kidneys, blood-pressure, plasma?) But that might be a negative in any case if one suspect internal bleeding?</p>
","<p>After some general research there are specifically 3 arguments that I came across that people give for supporting this particular theory.</p>

<p>1) somebody seriously injured might be given an anesthesia shot by the doctor or whoever that treats him first up for relief from the pain and distress. This would lead to relaxation of the stomach muscles and the contents of your stomach can travel up to your throat and into your lungs which would be fatal. Read about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"" rel=""nofollow"">pulmonary aspiration.</a> </p>

<p>2) the second case is if there is an injury to the gut or the GI tract, then providing water would be counter productive. A layman might not be able to assess the level of injury to someone just by sight. </p>

<p>3) the third is that giving water would increase blood pressure and (sometimes) apparently dilute the scars. This could also lead to chances where sutured wounds might reopen.</p>

<p>There are no real guidelines as to how much water can be given to an injured person. Depends on the situation or how much time he has been bleeding for and the kind of environment that he is subjected to like you pointed out. Some medics have recommended sucking on citrus fruits to prevent dehydration. Also, swabbing the patient all over the body with a cold compress can provide some relief and delay dehydration.</p>

"How do plants get carbon?","5886","","<p>How do plants get carbon? From air or soil? How is it different for aquatic plants and algae?</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter</a> soil has 3.3 times the size of the atmospheric pool of carbon.</p>
","<p><strong>SHORT ANSWER</strong></p>

<p>From the air</p>

<p><strong>LONG ANSWER</strong></p>

<p>Trees are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotroph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">autotrophs</a>, which means that they create their own compounds from inorganic carbon. So, carbon comes from inorganic carbon. This carbon comes from $CO_2$ (carbon dioxide) that is present in the air. The process by which this carbon is transformed into organic matter is called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">photosynthesis</a>. More specifically, the carbon get fixed through a chain of reaction called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-independent_reactions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Calvin cycle</a> that are part of the photosynthetic process.</p>

<p><strong>The great cycle of life</strong></p>

<p>You'll note that while plants (and some other things) uses $CO_2$ to build their mass, animals (and some other things) exhale $CO_2$ when they breathe. In other words, <strong>respiration</strong> frees up carbon dioxide while <strong>photosynthesis</strong> fixes carbon dioxide into organic matter.</p>

<p>Then you may want to ask where does the carbon we exhale come from. From our food. If you eat a beef burger for example, you'll the carbon that was present in the cow. The beef got its carbon from the grass that she grazed on. The grass got its carbon from the air and there is carbon in the air because animals (and some other things) exhale carbon when we breathe. <strong>respiration</strong> and <strong>photosynthesis</strong> are two essential series of chemical reactions that explain the existence of this cycle.</p>

"Why does uncompetitive inhibition decrease the Michaelis constant?","5882","","<p>I can't seem to find a good resource online that clearly outlines the difference between an uncompetitive, noncompetitive, and mixed inhibitor (I understand competitive inhibitor though).</p>

<p>More specifically, why does uncompetitive inhibition decrease the Michaelis constant?</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncompetitive_inhibitor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This reduction in the effective concentration of the E-S complex increases the enzyme's apparent affinity for the substrate through Le Chatelier's principle (Km is lowered) and decreases the maximum enzyme activity (Vmax), as it takes longer for the substrate or product to leave the active site. Uncompetitive inhibition works best when substrate concentration is high. An uncompetitive inhibitor need not resemble the substrate of the reaction it is inhibiting. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lineweaver-Burk Plot:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DULcj.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DULcj.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>

</blockquote>

<p>The uncompetetive inhibitor essentially ""locks"" the substrate in the enzyme thereby preventing the enzyme from catalyzing the substrate which would then decrease the amount of free enzyme. That should not, however, alter the value of $K_m$ because any copies of the enzyme that are still active (""not locked"") maintain the same affinity for the substrate. I applied that same logic to noncompetitive inhibition (no change in $K_m$), hence the confusion.</p>
","<p>First off, the difference between the types of inhibition:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>competitive inhibition</strong>: The inhibitor only binds to the substrate-free form of the enzyme. (Not necessarily at the active site!)</li>
<li><strong>uncompetitive inhibition</strong>: The inhibitor only binds to the substrate-bound form of the enzyme.</li>
<li><strong>noncompetitive inhibition</strong>: The inhibitor binds equally well to both the substrate-bound and substrate-free forms of the enzyme. (Some people feel this is just a non-special special case of mixed inhibition.)</li>
<li><strong>mixed inhibition</strong>: The inhibitor binds to both the substrate-free and substrate bound forms of the enzyme. (But not necessarily with the same affinity.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Secondly, you need to separate out the concept of <em>binding affinity</em> of the substrate from the concept of $K_m$. The binding affinity of the enzyme towards the substrate is just what you think it is: the equilibrium constant between the bound and unbound forms of the enzyme, in the absence of catalysis and inhibitor.</p>

<p>The $K_m$, on the other hand, is an overall parameter of the rate equation, and doesn't necessarily have a direct relation to substrate binding. The confusion between the two arises from the fact that in simple enzymatic systems, under the simplified conditions we normally study them in, $K_m$ is a pretty decent approximation of the substrate binding affinity. Thus you'll have introductory textbooks saying that ""$K_m$ is a measure of substrate affinity"". -- a gross oversimplification. They're certainly related, but they're not exactly identical - especially when you get to more complex reaction schemes. Confusing the two leads to problems.</p>

<p>The enzyme inhibition cases are an example of this. Enzyme inhibitors (even competitive ones ones) don't change the intrinsic binding affinity of the free enzyme to substrate. Instead, they draw off some of the enzyme from the productive pathway. Because they change the concentration of particular enzyme species, they change the observed rate equation. How they change the rate equation depends on which enzyme species they change the concentration of.</p>

<p>For a full accounting, you really should look at the derivations of the rate equations, and how the extra equilibria of the inhibitor binding changes things. (e.g. <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemical-engineering/10-492-2-integrated-chemical-engineering-topics-i-introduction-to-biocatalysis-fall-2004/lecture-notes/lecture4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> or <a href=""http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/enztech/inhibition.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) But for something of an intuitive explanation: </p>

<p><strong>pure noncompetitive</strong> inhibition reduces the concentrations of substrate-bound and substrate-free forms equally. (The concentration of product-bound forms being negligible in the standard initial rate equations.) This is basically the same as reducing the total amount of enzyme, i.e. reducing $V_{max}$ or apparent $k_{cat}$.</p>

<p><strong>competitive</strong> At saturating substrate concentration, the amount of free enzyme (and thus the effect of inhibition) is negligible. The rate at saturating substrate (i.e. $k_{cat}$) is thus the same. Therefore, it's the apparent $K_m$ that changes. (NOTE! The actual affinity to the substrate isn't changed by the inhibitor. Instead, the inhibitor specifically reduces the amount of free enzyme available, in a way that can be compensated for by higher substrate concentrations. This just so happens to change the rate equation in the same way changing the $K_m$ does.)</p>

<p><strong>uncompetitive</strong> At negligible substrate concentrations, the amount of substrate bound enzyme (and the effect of inhibition) is negligible. Thus the rate should be the same with and without the inhibitor. If you recall, the enzymatic reaction rate at negligible substrate is parameterized by $k_{cat}/K_m$. For uncompetitive inhibition, this needs to stay the same. Thus <em>both</em> $k_{cat}$ and $K_m$ need to change in the rate equation, to the same proportion.         </p>

<p><strong>mixed</strong> - A mixture of the above effects, depending on the relative affinities to the substrate bound/unbound forms of the enzyme.</p>

"Why is the Hydra Biologically Immortal?","5867","","<p>I have heard that the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_%28genus%29""><em>Hydra</em></a> organism is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_immortality"">biologically immortal</a> (later I found that there are more immortal organisms). Now I know that its immortality is related to its telomerase. The thing is that we all have telomerase, but we age and <em>Hydra</em> don't. What are the proteins (especially telomerase) related to aging in humans and <em>Hydra</em> and how do they work differently?</p>
","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/atid9.jpg"" alt=""a somewhat smaller picture of a Hydrae""></p>

<p>Hydra are just one of the many organisms which are immortal.  That is to say all their cells divide forever - there is no senescence (planned cell death) in any of their cells. Interestingly Hydrae that reproduce sexually age and die, but asexual reproduction appear to be immortal.  Animals that are immortal more often reproduce asexually... this may only be because immortality became unpopular in evolution early on and may have not developed senescence in the way other animals have, or lost it when it was not so integral to life.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306686/"">Although immortal Hydra also appears to share the (TTAGGG)n telomere repeat, there is as yet no data on how or whether they avoid chromosome end depletion. These data suggest the possibility that senescence or death of asexual individuals and colonies may in part result from a failure to maintain chromosome ends that are restored by going through a sexually reproductive cycle .</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So its not clear if the telomeres are protected in hydrae and other immortal animals.  I would guess they probably don't have active telomerase if they are truly immortal, though its possible the telomeres are shortened and are repaired.</p>

<p>There are other factors which are supposed to be important for immortality.  Yeast and single eukaryotes are not individually immortal; an individual mother cell can only divide a limited number of times. While hydrae are not a popular focus of research, there has been a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2536486/"">concerted effort in trying to understand yeast mortality</a> and there are more than one mechanism being pointed to. </p>

<p>Since there is no germline in single celled organisms, (they only have one copy of their genome to reproduce from) telomeric shortening would not be a useful mechanism for aging; Calorie restriction has been shown to prolong fission and budding yeast by activating pathways which slow aging by protecting against stress, and slowing down reproduction.  All of these findings have strong parallels in work in aging in animals which is a hot topic now.  </p>

<p>Finding these pathways is encouraging strong thought that aging and senescence are an evolutionary adaptation rather than a biological necessity. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our current knowledge suggests that an apoptotic program has evolved in microorganisms as a survival strategy beneficial to the group. This program is dependent on cellular pathways like the Sch9, Tor1, and Ras/PKA pathways and its activation reduces cell protection and maintenance and raises the level of superoxide production, which in turn contributes to cell damage and death. Superoxide also elevates DNA damage and mutation frequency in the aging cultures ... Aging and apoptosis are intrinsically related in yeast and the mechanisms that cause them have just begun to be elucidated. ...  will provide important information to understand the fundamental biology of aging in other species and investigate the controversial hypothesis that an “aging program” might be conserved in higher eukaryotes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is an open question as to whether an immortal yeast could be <em>engineered</em> to be immortal.  A team at Max Planck Institute did a lot of foot work and found a strain which they claim <a href=""http://dalje.com/en-lifestyle/finding-immortality-is-a-challenge-for-me/263225"">does not seem to experience individual mortality either</a>. </p>

<p>So this does indicates that immortality might not be a necessity for any cell or maybe even for animals.  Occasionally, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit"">even animal and human cells can be coaxed to revert to an immortalized state</a>, though usually it is the result of <a href=""http://actu.epfl.ch/news/demystifying-the-immortality-of-cancer-cells/"">cancerous rearrangements of the genome</a>.   </p>

<p>This is a rich field and there are lots of <a href=""http://news.discovery.com/animals/immortal-animals-reveal-anti-aging-secrets-110421.htm"">telomerase focused ideas too</a>.  Maybe someone can post something along those lines. </p>

"How does the cornea breathe during sleep?","5839","","<p>The cornea is not supplied with blood vessels and so exchanges gases directly with the atmosphere. So how does it breathe during sleep when our eyes are closed?</p>
","<p>As you noted, the cornea needs oxygen, yet it's not vascular. It needs to get it's oxygen supply from diffusion. In the daytime, diffusion occurs from air through the tear film covering the cornea.</p>

<p>The cornea spends about a third of it's lifetime under closed lids. At night, the tear film remains intact and is continuously replenished. The inner aspect of your eyelids, called the palpebral conjunctiva, are <em>highly</em> vascularized, with capillaries just below the surface (and accessory tear ducts and tiny mucosal glands to keep it moist). </p>

<p>When you sleep, oxygen (and nutrients) diffuses from the palpebral conjunctival capillaries through the tear film to your cornea.</p>

<p>The blood vessels in the palpebral conjunctiva are more permeable than most other capillaries and contribute fluid and nutrients to tears by leaking plasma. The surface epithelial cells are also a source of tear fluid because of a special arrangement of the cells such that there is more intercellular space allowing fluid, antibodies, and other plasma constituents to the surface of the conjunctiva. </p>

<p>I'm skeptical of believing that ants simply scout around until finding food; I'll use this case as an example:</p>

When he asked her what she was doing with them, she responded that her husband had her make a pie from them every year. </p>

<p>As her husband was presumably still alive, and since I regard this particular professor as reliable, what would have removed enough solanine from the berries to avoid ill effects? Does the concentration decrease upon ripening, or would cooking destroy the toxin? Would that also be why we fry green tomatoes?</p>

<p>(As a disclaimer, no-one should eat plants that are known to be poisonous. Even though some people don't react to poison ivy, it is still a bad idea to rub it all over your body.)</p>
","<p>If you ask Dr. Duke's phytochemical database, by far the most solanine is found in green potatoe <strong>fruits (their skin)</strong>, with much less in leaves and tissues. Similar values are seen in green tomatoes, with dozens of mg per 100g fruit. There is no value for <em>Solanum dulcamara</em> (doesn't mean there is nothing in it) but it appears to have small quantities of atropine. Furthermore, Wikipedia gives for solanine a minimum toxically effective dose for humans of 200 mg---that's where dizzyness and dispnoe starts---, and gives for children a lethal amount of <em>S. dulcamara</em> of 30-40 <strong>unripe</strong> berries or less. The amount of solanine increases (in potato) when temperature goes up, because it is produced by plants as an antifungal against rot. Ripening in <em>S. dulcamara</em> and, as we know all ourselves, potato and tomato, destroys solanine, so fully ripe berries seem to be okay. Solanine does <em>not</em> degrade when cooked but is lost with the cooking water. For an account of solanine poisoning from potatoes see e.g. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1597169/"" rel=""nofollow"">this free paper</a>.

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R5KaR.png"" alt=""Who would win? 1 trillion lions or the sun?"">
Obviously, the solution lies in how much energy either can output per unit of time.<br>
The total energy output of the sun is $3.8×10^{26} \frac{J}{s}$.<br>
The number of lions alone pales in comparison ($10^{12}$).  </p>

<p>However, I'm now trying to figure out how many lions it would take to have an output equal to the sun, but I seem to be having a hard time finding good data.  </p>

<p>What's the peak energy output of a lion per second (or where/how can I find such information)?</p>
","<p>Wow, as an astrophysicist who has just logged into biology SE for the first time, I didn't think I'd have a question I could immediately answer.</p>

<p>You are correct about the Sun's output, so what about the lion.</p>

<p>If the lion is in its usual passive state, i.e. lying around as shown in your picture, then you would not go far wrong in treating them as black body radiators (well this will give you an upper limit, though the emissivity of human skin is quite high, so it should be a reasonable approximation.). To estimate a power I need a lion's temperature and its surface area.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.felineconservation.org/feline_species/lion.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this site</a> the body temperature of a lion is 311.33 Kelvin.</p>

<p>I found a calculator that used the DuBois formula for surface area (for humans) and put in 440 pounds and 7 feet 10 for the weight and ""height"" of a (male, adult) lion - this returned a surface area of $3.6\ m^2$ (about twice a, male human, so sounds roughly ok).</p>

<p>Now using the Stefan-Boltzmann formula $P = \sigma A T^4$, I get the power output of a ""black body"" lion to be about 2 kW.</p>

<p>Thus $10^{12}$ lions have a power output of $2\times 10^{15}\ W$, which is 11 orders of magnitude less than the Sun.</p>

<p>But now take the question at its most basic. Compared to the Sun, the lion is a pretty effective power generation unit. The Sun only generates $2\times 10^{-4}\ W/kg$, whereas a lion-based power source weighs in with a massive $10\ W/kg$! </p>

<p>EDIT: Note that the calculation just assumes the Lion can produce this kind of power output whatever environment it is in. In practice a Lion absorbs a large fraction of this power from its surroundings and its internal metabolism does not need (and probably cannot) supply 2kW. Thus the 2kW should be reduced to some extent, though I'm not sure a simplistic $T^4 - T_{\rm env}^{4}$ calculation can be correct, unless one of you biologists tells me that a Lion's metabolism shuts down once the ambient (African) temperature approaches 311K (I guess in a human a lot of it goes in evaporating sweat?) Whatever, the order of magnitude of the answer is unchanged.</p>

  <p>Spindle fibers form a protein structure that divides the genetic
  material in a cell. [...] At the beginning of nuclear division, two
  wheel-shaped protein structures called centrioles position themselves
  at opposite ends of the cell forming cell poles. <strong>Long protein fibers
  called microtubules</strong> extend from the centrioles in all possible
  directions, forming what is called a <strong>spindle</strong>. Some of the
  microtubules attach the poles to the chromosomes by connecting to
  protein complexes called kinetochores. Kinetochores are protein
  formations that develop on each chromosome around the centromere,
  which is a region located near the middle of a chromosome. Other
  microtubules bind to the chromosome arms or extend to the opposite end
  of the cell. During the cell division phase called metaphase, the
  microtubules pull the chromosomes back and forth until they align in a
  plane along the equator of the cell, which is called the equatorial
  plane.</p>

"Why do flies leave dirty spots on shiny/glossy surfaces?","5800","","<p>I've seen flies leave dark spots on lacquered wood, mirrors, glass and monitors. Why do they do that? Is it some food stash or are they dumping waste in a single spot? Why pick a smooth surface?</p>
","<p>House flies (Musca domestica) prefer to rest on light colored surfaces, and what is lighter than windows, windowframes, glossy surfaces that reflect light, etc.? Where they rest (not eat) is where they defecate (or regurgitate), leaving marks politely called ""fly specks"".</p>

"Earth overshoot day: is it a sound concept?","5780","","<p>Today, August 8th, is <a href=""http://www.overshootday.org/"">Earth Overshoot Day</a> (EOD) for 2016, the day when humanity supposedly has consumed the natural resources available from the planet for the year 2016; we're now running a deficit, somehow. At least if your believe the calculations of the <a href=""http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/"">Global Footprint Network</a> (GFN), the think tank behind this concept. EOD is well reported by media every year, and perhaps it does some good as an ecology awareness thing. But is the idea scientifically sound?</p>

<p>EOD is based on the <em>ecological footprint</em> concept. The ecological footprint of a person (measured in hectares) is the area of the earth required to extract the natural resources needed to sustain that person: to grow crops, keep farm animals, obtain natural resources for consumables, etc. It's a very complex thing to calculate, and of course people argue about what the correct formula should be. One <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/08/26/ecological-footprints-a-good-idea-gone-bad/"">article by Willis Eschenbach (2010)</a> goes into some depth and argues that the formula used by GFN vastly overestimates the footprint. I don't know who is right, but it does seem like the footprint is very difficult to estimate, so we should probably be careful with drawing strong conclusions.</p>

<p>But I have a more fundamental problem with EOD. Regardless of how it's calculated, the claim that we have today ""overshot"" our yearly earth-budget, at 8 months out of 12, means that we are consuming about 1.5 of the available food and natural resources available; or that the footprint of humanity is 1.5 Earths. This is not some kind of parable: GFN really claims that we have <em>exhausted</em> our natural resources, by a wide margin, and that this has been going on since the 1970's.</p>

<p>My question is, <em>what are we all living on then?</em></p>

<p>As of today there should be no more food around, or any other natural-derived product for that matter. If GFNs estimate is correct, shouldn't humanity be long dead? Shouldn't we expect 1/3 of the earth's ""surplus"" population to die off pretty quickly? Doesn't the fact that we're not dead prove that EOD is wrong? Isn't it physically impossible for our total footprint to exceed 1 Earth?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Nice to see that this question stirred a lot of debate! :) I think several answers bring up one key point that resolves the problem: GFN defines the footprint not as the <em>actual</em> area required for production at present (which must be &lt; 1 Earth), but the area required for <em>sustainable</em> production (which is larger). Exactly how the sustainable area is defined is still mysterious to me, but I guess it is at least theoretically possible.</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR: it's a simplified measure of sustainability, but accurate enough to be useful for public engagement</strong> </p>

<p>EOD is hosted and calculated by <a href=""http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/"">Global Footprint Network</a> (GFN), an international think tank. The GFN estimates national and global net supply and demand for renewable resources, specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>food and fiber products,</li>
<li>livestock and fish products,</li>
<li>timber and other forest products,</li>
<li>space for urban infrastructure, and</li>
<li>carbon sequestration.</li>
</ol>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.overshootday.org/"">the website</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Global Footprint Network measures a population’s demand for and
  ecosystems’ supply of resources and services. These calculations then
  serve as the foundation for calculating Earth Overshoot Day.</p>
  
  <p>On the supply side, a city, state, or nation’s biocapacity represents
  its biologically productive land and sea area, including forest lands,
  grazing lands, cropland, fishing grounds, and built-up land.</p>
  
  <p>On the demand side, the Ecological Footprint measures a population’s
  demand for plant-based food and fiber products, livestock and fish
  products, timber and other forest products, space for urban
  infrastructure, and forest to absorb its carbon dioxide emissions from
  fossil fuels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The results are reported in 'global hectares', the area which would be required using global average productivity, to aid intercomparability.</p>

<p>The methodology was <a href=""http://10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.005"">published in 2013 (Borucke &amp;al 2013)</a>.</p>

<p>So, to answer the <strong>question in your title</strong> (""Earth overshoot day: is it a sound concept?""), data quality may be an issue (I haven't pored over the paper in detail) but the basic methodology is arguably appropriate for the question they're asking. The only issue I might have is that they effectively consider land and sea use to be interchangeable, but I'm not sure the alternative would be an improvement.</p>

<p>To answer the <strong>second part of your question</strong> (""what are we all living on then?""), <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"">it is possible to harvest more from a system than it can sustainably produce</a>. Exceeding this harms the future productivity of the system. To take the specific examples named for EOD:</p>

<ol>
<li>Overharvesting plant-based food and fibre products can result in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_degradation"">soil acidification, soil erosion, and/or soil salinification</a>;</li>
<li>Overharvesting livestock and fish products can result in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overgrazing"">overgrazing</a> and/or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfishing"">overfishing</a>;</li>
<li>Overharvesting timber and other forest products results in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation"">deforestation</a>;</li>
<li>Using more space for urban infrastructure reduces the availability of land for the other examples on this list;</li>
<li>Producing more carbon emissions than can be absorbed by its forest leads to an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas"">increase in atmospheric carbon, resulting in climate change</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately, while 'Earth Overshoot Day' is a public engagement activity, there is a reasonably robust and transparent methodology behind it which is good enough for the job. <strong>Remember: all models are wrong, some models are useful.</strong> </p>

"How do female hormones cause blood to clot?","5758","","<p>On most female-hormone supplements you get a warning that is something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of a combination hormonal contraceptives (CHC), like NuvaRing, is associated with increased risks of several serious side effects, including blood clots, stroke, or heart attack. (<a href=""http://www.nuvaring.com/consumer/"">Nuvaring</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The use of a CHC, like NuvaRing, is associated with increased risks of several serious side effects, including blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</p>

<p>It also goes onto state that smoking can increase these risks. </p>

<ul>
<li>What makes these hormones so dangerous (prone to clotting)?</li>
<li>If a person is naturally high in these hormones are they at a higher risk of blood clots?</li>
<li>Why/How does smoking affect the hormones - or is the increase risk just due to the natural risk of smoking?</li>
</ul>
","<p>These combination contraceptives contain two substances: Estrogen and progestin (a synthetic progesterone). Both are used together to overcome the negative effects of single substance drugs as acne or sickness. </p>

<p>The risk for blood clots has been known for quite a while (see reference 1 and 2) and is generally caused by raised levels of clotting factors (especially VII and X), increased plasma fibrinogen, increased platelet aggregation in the blood and reduced activity of antithrombin III (which inhibits coagulation). This can happen as well in pregnancy when the factors are naturally elevated (that's the way these contraceptives simulate pregnancy to the body). The paper shows this nicely for two of the factors of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blood coagulation cascade</a> (factor VII and X):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yxbZG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This risk is relatively rare, it affects only about 1-5 in 10.000 women, but is still not negligible. The risk is much higher in persons with defects in the blood coagulation cascade. Compared to this, pregnant women have a risk for blood clots of 5-20 per 10.000 women (for details see <a href=""http://www.straighthealthcare.com/oral-contraceptives.html#blood-clots"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>).</p>

<p>Blood coagulation is really fine tuned to ensure proper function when necessary but no blood clotting when not. Basically activating and deactivating hold a balance, as depicted in figure 1 from reference 3:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9VRZ1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Smoking now disturbs this balance by inhibiting fibrinolysis and promoting the accumulation of fibrin and pushes it more to the site of coagulation. What causes the problem here is the elevation of clotting factors in combination with the disturbance of the balance between activation and inhibition of clotting. See reference 3 for the details.</p>

<p>This effect seems to be limited to high concentration single estrogen and estrogen/progestin combination preparations, while there seems to be no such effect in progestin single preparations (although data is limited here). There is also a significant difference in the type of estrogen used. See references 4 and 5 for more details.</p>

<p>The mechanism of how this works is relatively straightforward. The estrogen binds to the estrogen receptor on the cell surface and forms a receptor-ligand complex. This leads to signalling inside the cells which finally results in changed gene expression. Additionally the complex can be internalized by the cell. Inside the cell this complex can bind to the so-called ""hormone response element"" and also regulate the expression of genes. This is explained in detail for Factor XII in reference 6 (and works like this for other parts as well). See the image for illustration (from reference 7):</p>

"How do lilies sense day and night and open and close their flowers?","5752","","<p>We have lots of lily flowers inside our garden. Their flowers are open in day and closed in night. How do lilies sense day and night and open and close their flowers?</p>
","<p>The three main cues for flower opening/closing used by plants are temperature, light and humidity (<a href=""http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/389/1801.full"">van Doorn &amp; van Meteren 2003</a>, freely available pdf), with the first two being most common. Plants with daily opening and closing of flowers can be divided into nocturnal (open at night) and diurnal (open at day). There exists several different mechanisms for how flowers open and close, and these include e.g. reversible expansion and contraction of cells by changes in water balance and differential growth of cells due to temperature (in either the petals themselves or cells at the base of flowers). See the previously referred paper for examples.</p>

<p>The evolutionary advantages and molecular mechanisms (along with the circadian clock of plants) behind opening and closing of flowers are open research fields. Several evolutionary hypothesis exists for explaining different flowering strategies, and these often deal with efficient pollination (close when good pollinators are absent), protection against frost, conservation of resources (e.g. water) or predator/pathogen defence.</p>

"How to DIY preserve pet DNA today so that it can be used in 20 years","5750","","<p>I know that there are companies that offer a kit+storage of your pet DNA for around $2k.
My question is if there is any other option for doing this yourself with a thought in mind that in 20+ years the technology will get so advanced that even this DIY sample can be utilized.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Maybe drying a blood drop or mixing blood with alcohol/acetone?</p>

<p>Also, I read somewhere that it is better if the pet is still very young, because if you take old pet DNA the clone will exhibit mature signs even as a youngster. Is this true? If yes then what is the top age that is safe?</p>
","<p>For the impatient, I'm going to say that probably if you only have a regular home freezer, its unlikely that you will be able to do this. If you have access to a -80C or liquid nitrogen storage its possible, but also less likely. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v436/n7051/abs/436641a.html"">Cloning an animal typically starts with the transplantation of a nucleus into an egg cell whose nucleus has been removed</a>.  So unless things change drastically in the next 20 years, just purifying DNA and keeping it in a tube of the fridge is not enough - you need to preserve epithelial (skin cells) or some other tissue in a state which can be revived to produce a live and intact cell when you want to do the cloning.  </p>

<p>Its possible that we will have machines that can take DNA from a DNA prep and produce a living cell - this is what we hope to do with the mammoth and other extinct animals from fossil tissue some day.  But whether that will be the case in 20 years is just a guess, whether it is affordable is also just a guess. </p>

<p>So from what we know now, you will need to preserve a piece of tissue from the animal when it is alive.  I'm not an expert on how to do this, but you might be able to get the skin cells to sort of turn into a cell line and then freeze them for not too much money.  </p>

<p>If you do this, regular freezers are not cold enough to prevent freezer burn.  This is what happens when you put a steak in to the freezer, wrapped in plastic even it will shrivel up and start to dry out as the water in the ice starts to sublime out of the package (the dry air in the freezer basically sucks the water out of the food).  If this happens to your animal tissue, its probably not going to revive.</p>

<p>Scientific labs use -80C freezers and liquid nitrogen storage because the water turns into a glass and all biochemical reactions are basically stopped. (besides drying out, the enzymes like DNAse are still nominally functioning in the cells at -20C and even simple bacterial cells don't live for more than a year at -20C, much less mammalian cells).  For preserving cell lines, liquid nitrogen is much more preferred.  I would say that properly produced cell lines can theoretically revive after indefinite liquid nitrogen storage.  </p>

<p>So that's a quick answer.  Sorry to be a party pooper - things could change quite a bit in the next 20 years, but we just don't know how much.  popping a paw in a baggie or some DNA extract into the freezer might work, but its hard to say for sure. </p>

<p>As far as the choice of where the DNA comes from in the animal, its true that skin cell lines are often producing imperfect animals - the DNA may be modified in the skin in various ways that cause the animal to be smaller, weaker, or even deformed compared to the donor.  At this time all the protocols I see (and i could be wrong) are skin cells.  I would expect that there is a better tissue to preserve, but that might be just a guess at this point.  Its likely that in the next 20 years the choice of cell line from the donor will change quite a bit as well.  </p>

"Why do some mammals not have testes in a scrotum?","5743","","<p>Coming from an evolutionary approach, Is the only purpose of a scrotum to regulate the temperature of the testes? </p>

<p>Knowing all mammals are warm blooded, shouldn't all mammals have testes in a scrotum?</p>
","<p>Having descended testes is a derived characteristic within mammals; monotremes and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrotheria"">Afrotheria</a> (including elephants) all retain the ancestral character state (Kleisner, et al., 2010)<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasiatheria"">2</a></sup>. Among those mammals with descended testes, these can be ascrotal or scrotal. Testicular descent is hypothesized to have only occurred once within Mammalia, with the ascrotal <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasiatheria"">Laurasiatheria</a>. Descended ascrotal testes are found in cetaceans, phocid seals, hippos, tapirs, rhinos, and some bats. Descended scrotal testes are found in horses, pigs, camels, and Carnivora.</p>

<p>Since basal mammals would presumably have to regulate testicular temperature just as much as derived mammals, the temperature regulation hypothesis seems to not hold up. So the real question is: why have a scrotum? One hypothesis has to do with evolution of fast locomotion (e.g., galloping).</p>

<p>According to Frey (1991, 40)<sup><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0469.1991.tb00443.x/abstract"">4</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The strong flexions and extensions of the vertebral column during
  gallop should cause intense fluctuations of intra-abdominal pressure.
  Fluctuations of intra-abdominal pressure severely impede continuous
  flow of blood in the abdominal veins. Periodically reduced venous
  drainage resulting in fluctuations of intra-testicular pressure would
  impair the process of spermiohistogenesis, which is dependent on an
  absolutely constant pressure within the testis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because in the human male, scrotal testes function optimally at
  temperatures below that of the body, much speculation, and a
  considerable amount of research, has gone into attempting to see what
  (metabolic) advantage might accrue from this lower temperature,
  without considering the possibility that this is a secondary
  adaptation to an enforced external position.</p>

After a little bit, it flew a few meters away and fell. I was wondering what could these beings eat, so that I can help it...
Any answers would be great appreciated!
Thanks in advance</p>
","<p>Adult butterflies don't eat! I mean.... not in the sense of chewing on food. They rather drink. They get their nutrients via ingestion of liquid substances. Their mouth consists of a long tube called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proboscis</a> that acts as a straw.</p>

<p><strong>What do butterflies feed on?</strong></p>

<p>The vast majority of butterflies eat nectar from flowers. Many species are quite specialized and feed on the nectar of a few species only.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions though. Some species feed on tree sap, dung, mud (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud-puddling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mud-puddling</a>), pollen, or rotting fruit. Butterflies are attracted to sodium and may as well try to feed on human sweat but I doubt there exist any species would get a non-negligible source of nutrients from human sweat. Coming to exceptions, you should definitely consider reading @DmitryGrigoryev's answer as well.</p>

<p><strong>What do caterpillars feed on?</strong></p>

<p>Of course, you are probably aware that butterflies have a complex (-ish) life cycle. The larva is called a caterpillar, while the adult is called a butterfly. So what do caterpillars eat?</p>

<p>Caterpillars have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible_(insect_mouthpart)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mandibles</a>, so they can chew tissues and not just drink. Most caterpillars eat leaves and other plants parts. Again, many species are specialized to only a few plant species.</p>

<p>There are of course exceptions. For example in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phengaris"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Phengaris</a> genus, (such as the famous <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_blue"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">large blue (<em>Phengaris arion</em>)</a>, caterpillars mimic ant larvae. They live in an ant colony were they get fed by ants. When they undergo metamorphosis, ants finally figure out the trickery and start attacking the butterfly. The butterfly has therefore very little time to try to fly away from the colony before getting killed. It is a critical life stage for individuals of this species.</p>

<p><strong>How to feed a butterfly</strong></p>

<p>This section exists thanks to @Rodrigo's recommendation.</p>

<p>As a substitute of nectar one can simply use sugar water. The optimal sugar concentration (in mass-mass) is around 35% (<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/108/40/16618.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kim  et al. 2011</a>) although it likely vary among species.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/108/40/16618.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kim  et al. 2011</a> explains that what limits optimal sugar concentration for insects is the viscosity of the solution. Too much sugar renders the solution too viscous and difficult to forage on. Interestingly, the ability of drinking viscous solutions depends upon the drinking technic (active suction, capillary suction or viscous dipping) which vary, not among butterflies but among insects. The article is interesting.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide is problematic for us because it has an even higher affinity to hemoglobin than oxygen does. This means that our red blood cells will not exchange carbon monoxide for oxygen in our lungs.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>My question is: for high-altitude-adapted organisms such as the bar-headed goose, whose hemoglobin has a higher affinity to oxygen than ours does, is carbon monoxide still poisonous?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. To put out a few other facts from the Stritch School of Medicine:</p>

<pre><code>CO has 250 times the affinity for hemoglobin than O2
Hb becomes 100% saturated with CO at PCO = 0.6 mm Hg
Hb becomes 100% saturated with O2 at PO2 = 600 mm Hg 
</code></pre>

<p>What does that mean? Well, that means that when the partial pressure of CO is 1mmHg, you're well and truly dead. So if the bar headed goose could survive in an environment more than 1% CO its hemoglobin would have to bind to molecular oxygen very, very tightly below 1mmHg. If this was true you would expect their binding curve to reach a high % of O2 saturation below a partial pressure of 1mmHg. Does it exhibit that?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TJqa9.jpg"" alt=""Bird hemoglobin binding curves""></p>

<p>Nope. At 1mmHg (remember, CO has 100% binding at 0.6mmHg) the bar headed goose hemoglobin's saturation is less than 2%. In fact, they're pretty similar to humans:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9D0Gd.gif"" alt=""Human hemoglobin curve""></p>

<p>Is this casual glance conclusive? Well... <em>Not entirely</em>. I couldn't find any carbon monoxide data for the bar headed goose, but to overcome the 250x higher affinity for CO the goose's hemoglobin would have to be very, very different from that of humans while still exhibiting a similar binding curve. I've not received the education to determine if that's possible or how it would occur, but it is a very remote possibility.</p>

<p>Erring on the side of ""most likely"", however, I think it's safe to say that given a room filled with 1% CO you'd end up eventually killing anything that relied on hemoglobin to move necessary oxygen to tissues.</p>

"What is meant by a muscle fiber being glycerinated?","5702","","<p>I was popped this questions today, ""what is a glycerinated muscle fiber, and what is required for its contraction,"" and had little idea.

<p>There's a limited amount of information out there about this. It appears that it is a type of <em>in vitro</em> system requiring special preparation of typical muscle tissue. I was wondering if anyone here had a little more information. Is this something that's just used in teaching lab exercises?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Glycerination disrupts the membranes of the muscle cells, ruptures mitochondria, and leaches out soluble constituents such as ATP and inorganic ions. However, glycerinated muscle retains the organized structural array of myosin thick filaments and actin thin filaments, actin-associated proteins like troponin and tropomyosin which regulate contraction, and the functional capacity for contraction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would expect that because the sample has lost ATP and inorganic ions, you would need to supply ATP (the source of energy), $Mg^{2+}$ (which is necessary for ATP hydrolysis) and $Ca^{2+}$ (to induce the contraction). </p>

"Why can't people talk while inhaling?","5698","","<p>Why do we have to exhale in order to talk? From looking on Wikipedia, it seems like it has something to do with the glottis, but I'm not clear on the mechanism that makes speech sound so different when air is coming in.</p>
","<p>Via deep scientific analysis (i.e. trying it myself 5 seconds ago), I have determined that you can in fact speak while breathing in, it just sounds funny.</p>

<p>Think of the vocal chords as being like the body of a flute. As air passes by them, they vibrate and make sounds. Through careful modulation of their shape, specific sounds can be reproducibly made (this is equivalent to opening and closing the stops on the metaphorical flute). The way the pressure in your throat changes when you inspire (breathe in) is very different from the way in which the pressure changes when you expire (breathe out). These pressure differences are a large part of the reason why you sound different when you speak during inspiration as opposed to expiration, just like breathing into a flute differently would produce different sounds (although potentially the same notes). </p>

<p>Other physiological, neurological, etc. effects probably also cause differences in the vocal cords during expiration/inspiration and thus also contribute somewhat to the differences in the sound.</p>

"Did the Zika virus mutate?","5658","","<p>The Zika virus <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_virus_outbreak_timeline"" rel=""noreferrer"">was already present and known to the world</a> (mostly in Southeast Asia) before the current outbreak. </p>

<p>Why has the virus caused such an extreme outbreak? </p>

<p>Has it mutated from its ancestral form such as that found in Southeast Asia?</p>
","<p>There is one main answer to this question: The Zika virus spreads so fast because it never emerged in this part of the world. Hence there is no natural immunity available in the population and a lot of infections occur. Once this ""first wave"" of infections is over, the level within the population will fall drastically. Some more information on this topic can be found <a href=""http://blog.oup.com/2016/01/zika-virus-pandemic/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>It is of course possible that the Zika virus has acquired a new mutation which adapts it better to humans and allows spreading much easier, but this is not yet known, since the situation in South America is still changing very fast with a lot of cases occurring and analysis going on. It still can be enough that the virus never emerged in Southern America and that there is no natural immunity available. </p>

<p>According to the paper in reference 1 (which is only a brief communication) the sequences of the envelope proteins of the virus are similar to the strains circulating in Asia and do not carry novel mutations:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ipxDB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ipxDB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The Surinam strains are the ones published in the paper mentioned above and are from South America. I haven't (yet) found any other analysis, but this will only be a matter of time. At the moment we cannot make a final statement on this although there is some speculation around.</p>

<p>Edit 23/02/2016: There is still no final conclusion available, but there is an interesting paper available on the Biorxiv-Preprintserver, which analyses the mutation rate in the genomes of the publically available strains. It can be found in reference 2.</p>

<p>Based on the available genomes, the author calculates the mutation rate of the Zika virus to about 10 Mutations/year. The virus is a RNA virus which have generally higher mutation rates than DNA viruses.</p>

<p>In the analysis he finds a number of non-synonymous mutations (mutations which lead to a basepair exchange), as seen in table 2:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9uOFe.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9uOFe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Especially named is the M2634V mutation, but since this is in one of the envelope proteins, the author finds it relatively unlikely (although not completely), that this causes a much higher mutation rate.</p>

<p>In the Diskussion of the paper he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sudden spread of Zika to South and Central America does not appear
  to have been due any particular change in the mosquito vector or
  anything to make the Zika virus itself more virulent. But rather from
  the fact that infected people are now able to fly rapidly from country
  to country, thereby spreading the disease extremely easily. This means
  there is little to stop the epidemic continuing to spread to further
  areas of population which have little, if any, herd immunity against
  the virus.</p>

<p>Edit (23.10.2016): There is now an interesting website which builds a realtime phylogenetic tree from the data published (it can be found <a href=""http://nextstrain.org/zika/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). The data also shows where in the virus the mutations occur:</p>

<p>Are there non-focal CNVs? What are they? Where did the term ""focal"" originate? Is there a specific paper that coined (and hopefully unambiguously defined) the term?</p>

<p>A search for ""focal copy number variation"" on Google Scholar should turn up plenty of papers <em>about it</em>. The GISTIC algorithm is a popular computational method for finding putative CNVs- so information about this algorithm may have some clues.</p>

<p>A <a href=""ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/genepattern/modules_public_server_doc/GISTIC.pdf"">documentation text</a> for one GISTIC implementation on the Broad Institute's website states the following:</p>

<blockquote>

  primarily to broad events (called “broad”), focal events (called “focal”), or 
  independently significant broad and focal events (called “both”).</p>

<p>Focal CNVs are regions of repeated genetic information that only span a small proportion  (&lt;25%) of the chromosome arm (although this does not seem to be a consistent rule), and can contain few genes. CNVs greater than this are termed either 'large-scale' or 'broad'.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To identify SCNAs [<em>somatic copy number alterations</em>], VarScan 2 compares Q20 (base quality >=20) read depths between tumor and normal samples for contiguous regions of coverage ... Therefore, we apply a circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm (Seshan and Olshen 2010) to delineate segments by copy number and identify significant change-points. <strong>A subsequent joining procedure merged adjacent segments of similar copy number and classified them as either large-scale (>25% of chromosome arm) or focal events.</strong></p>

<p>This paper is reporting bacterial genes that drive focal chromosomal aberrations, but do not give a great definition (as it seem quite arbitrary to me);</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many of these [chromosomal] aberrations concern large chromosomal regions, which makes it difficult to identify actual driver genes. Increased resolution has led to the detection of <strong>focal chromosomal aberrations, defined as 3 Mb or smaller in size</strong> [5–8].

<li><p>Roads are presumably not the only ecological niche where animals with wheels could thrive. I'm thinking of frozen lakes, although there skates would be better than wheels.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What, therefore, is <em>the</em> explanation for there not being any wheeled animals?
Please consider, in your answer, the counterfactual: What assumption of yours would be falsified once a wheely animal <em>is</em> discovered?</strong></p>
","<p>Wheels are possible on the molecular level — bacterial flagella are rotating cores inside a molecular motor, but wheels larger than the flagellum have not really been found. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YlbP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A single animal with a wheel is an improbable* development that would require a single animal have two separable parts (axle/wheel and body).  </p>

<p>[*read as: <em>pretty much impossible</em>]</p>

<p>It's hard to imagine how such a thing could evolve.  A wheel and axle would need to be made of living tissue, otherwise it would be vulnerable to wear and tear.  Wheels also have problems going over uneven terrain, which is really all terrain animals live in.  It's difficult to imagine what sort of selection conditions would be strong enough to push animals away from legs. </p>

<p>If you include driver-vehicle symbionts where the 'car' and 'wheel' are actually two animals, then they <em>have</em> evolved. Parasites can have all sorts of symbiotic control over their victims including as means of transport. The Jewel Wasp is one which is the most suggestive of what you may be thinking. The wasp stings its victim (a cockroach) in the thorax to immobilize the animal and then again just behind its head.  After this, the wasp can ride the beetle, steering it by holding its antennae back to its nest where the roach is immobilized to feed the wasp larvae there.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31536/title/Animal-Mind-Control/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(see section ""Pet cockaroaches"" in this reference.)</a></p>

<p>As to the three schools of thought you added to the question, I would probably rather say there were two strong arguments against.  The first is whether there is an evolutionary path to wheels (argument 1 in your question), which I doubt.  Given even a large amount of evolutionary time you will not see a naked human being able to fly on their own power.  Too many structural characteristics of the body plan have been made to all be reversed so that wings or other means of aerial conveyance will show up. The same can be said for wheels when the body plans have fins/legs/and wings already. </p>

<p>Argument 3, which I also tend to agree with, is perhaps more convincing.  By the time a pair of animals makes a symbiotic relationship to do this, or a single macroscopic animal evolves wheels, they will literally develop legs and walk away. When life came onto the land this happened, and since then it's happened several times.  It's sort of like saying that the random movement of water molecules might line up to run a stream uphill. There's just such a strong path downwards, that the statistical chances of you seeing it happen are nil.  </p>

<p>This is a hypothetical case, but arguing this in a convincing way I think you would need to lay out:  a) an environment whose conditions created enough of a selective advantage for wheels to evolve over legs or other similar adaptations we already see. Perhaps based on the energy efficiency of wheels;   b) some sort of physiological model for the wheels that convey a reasonable lifestyle for the wheel. </p>

<p>There are lots of questions that would need to be satisfied in our thought experiment.  Here are some: ""the symbiotic wheel would be spinning constantly; if it died the driver creature would be completely defenseless""; ""if the ground were bumpy, all these wheeled animals would get eaten""; ""the wheel symbiont — how would it eat while its spinning all the time? Only fed by the driver? Even symbionts such as barnacles or lampreys on the flanks of sharks still have their own ability to feed.""  </p>

<p>For many similar questions the same sort of discussion ensues where there are many disadvantages which outweigh advantages for animals. e.g.
""why are all the flying animals and fish and plants even more similar to airplanes than helicopters?""</p>

<p>Sorry if I seem negative, but way back in grad school I actually did go over some of these angles. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/the-first-gear-discovered-in-nature-15916433"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">First Gear found in a Living Creature</a>.</strong> 
A <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6151/1254.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">european plant hopper insect with one of the largest accelerations known in biology has been found to have gears</a>!  (There's a movie on the article page.
)</p>

<p>The little bug has gears in its exoskeleton that synchronize its two jumping legs.  Once again selection suprises. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The gears themselves are an oddity. With gear teeth shaped like
  cresting waves, they look nothing like what you'd find in your car or
  in a fancy watch.  There could be two
  reasons for this. Through a mathematical oddity, there is a limitless
  number of ways to design intermeshing gears. So, either nature evolved
  one solution at random, or, as Gregory Sutton, coauthor of the paper
  and insect researcher at the University of Bristol, suspects, the
  shape of the issus's gear is particularly apt for the job it does.
  It's built for ""high precision and speed in one direction,"" he says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gears do not rotate 360 degrees, but appear on the surface of two joints to synchronize them as they wind up like a circular spring.  The gear itself is not living tissue, so the big solves the problem of regenerating the gear by growing a new set when it molts (i.e. gears that continually regenerate and heal are still unknown).  It also does not keep its gears throughout its lifecycle.  So the arguments here still stand; the exception still supports the rule.</p>

"Why pick just a single bacterial transformed colony","5629","","<p>So after bacteria have been transformed to perhaps grow up a plasmid of interest, why pick only a single bacterial colony from a selective plate for further expansion?</p>

<p>I understand that this is to ensure that you are only working with a single genetic makeup because each separate colony is derived from only a single bacterium. What I can't rationalize is that if I am trying to expand and isolate a plasmid of interest, all colony expansions on a selective antibiotic plate should contain my plasmid. So is it really necessary to take only a single colony, because all colonies I pick should  be useful to me.</p>
","<p>This is a matter of pragmatism in the culture process. </p>

<p>Taking 100 colonies instead of 1 increases the inoculation volume by a factor of 100, which then saves you perhaps 2 hours of bacterial growth time before your culture reaches the OD you want. </p>

<p>However, mutations and loss of plasmid in culture, while unlikely, are possible, especially if the bacteria were not cloning strains with their recombinases knocked out. In such a case, you would risk the downstream experiments being contaminated with mutants, be that protein expression, retroviral plasmid production, or something else. </p>

<p>Worse still, the mixture of bacteria containing mutants is less likely to be detected, since had you picked a single mutant colony, there would be absolutely no result, but a contaminated culture would produce a low but still positive result. Therefore, you may end up wasting many days or weeks troubleshooting your downstream experiments.</p>

<p>Therefore, picking single colonies is simply a matter of ""better safe than sorry"". </p>

"Why do only two sexes exist for animals?","5610","","<p>Why, from the natural selection point of view, do only two sexes exist for animals?</p>
","<p>To get a non-circular answer to why humans and other mammals have only two sexes, it's helpful to take a look at our evolutionary history.  While mammals possess several adaptations to a terrestrial life cycle, including internal fertilization and gestation, which require substantial anatomic specialization between males and females, these are all secondary features that evolved long after our aquatic ancestors had acquired two distinct sexes.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we look at animals like fish, which reproduce via external fertilization, it's not at all obvious why they might not have more than two sexes.  After all, for many aquatic animals, mating involves little more than the female and the male releasing their respective gametes into the water, where they meet and fuse to a form new zygote, which can then divide and grow into a new adult.  Seen that way, there seems to be no reason why there could not be more than two ""mating types"", as in many fungi, such that gametes of any two distinct types could fuse into zygote.</p>

<p>The answer lies in the fact that the male and female gametes aren't actually that similar: the female gametes, or eggs, are typically large cells that contain all the nutrients necessary for the new zygote to develop into a viable individual, whereas the male gametes, or sperm, are tiny and produced in huge numbers.  This asymmetry is known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisogamy"">anisogamy</a>, and modeling its origin has been an important topic in the theoretical study of evolution.</p>

<p>Without going into details on the evolution of anisogamy, once it exists, it clearly forces the mating types to also split into two groups: there's no advantage in two microgametes (sperm) fusing, since the resulting zygote would lack the nutrients it needs to be viable, whereas the fusion of two macrogametes (eggs) would simply be inefficient &mdash; eggs, being large, are comparatively rare and expensive, and wasting two of them to produce only one offspring would be suboptimal even if the resulting zygote was viable.  Nor is there really room in such a scheme for gametes of intermediate size: they'd be too small to fuse into a viable zygote with sperm, but too large to be produced in sufficient amounts to be effective in fertilizing eggs.</p>

<p>Of course, there's nothing that would stop a single adult from producing both micro- and macrogametes, but such an adult would not really be a third sex &mdash; it would just be male and female at the same time, a mating strategy known as (simultaneous) hermaphroditism, which indeed occurs relatively often in nature.</p>

<p>So, if pretty much all animals are anisogamous, why do fungi remain isogamous (and often have multiple mating types), then?  Well, one explanation is that the main drivers for the evolution of anisogamy &mdash; sperm competition and transportation risk &mdash; don't really apply to fungi, which mate when two sessile haploid mycelia grow and come into contact with each other.  Since the gametes are not motile, there's no advantage for either/any sex to produce more of them (at the cost of smaller size) in order to increase the chance of successful mating.  Thus, isogamous mating works fine for the lifestyle of fungi, and having multiple mating types is then a useful adaptation to make successful mating between neighboring mycelia more likely.</p>

"Why do human eyes glow red on a photo and dog's eyes green?","5581","","<p><strong>Previous Research</strong></p>

<p>I know that cameras sometimes come with an anti ""red eye"" functionality that involves two flashes, presumably the second flash coincides with the shutter opening.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Why do camera flashes sometimes lead to photos of humans with red eyes? And why do dog's eyes appear green?</p>

<p><strong>Related</strong></p>

<p>The reason for the green dog's eyes has been answered quite shortly under the question ""<a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27621/why-do-dogs-eyes-glow-green-on-a-photo"">why-do-dogs-eyes-glow-green-on-a-photo</a>"", but that question does not answer my specific question: <strong>Why do humans have red eyes on flashed photos and why are dog's eyes  green?</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uOHIe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
In humans it is basically the red <strong><em>choroid plexus</em></strong> in the back of the eye you are seeing on a flashed photo, while it is the green-reflecting <strong><em>tapetum lucidum</em></strong> in dogs.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
The red-eye effect in humans was explained nicely by <a href=""http://www.yalescientific.org/2011/05/what-causes-the-red-eye-effect/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yale Scientific Magazine</a>, and I adapted the following text from that source:</p>

<p>The human eye can effectively adjust to different light conditions, but this adaptation is also what leads to the red-eye effect. The eye regulates the amount of entering light by contracting or expanding the pupil. At night, your pupils will accordingly enlarge to extract more light from their surroundings. However, this dilation also leaves your eyes unprepared for the sudden burst of light from a camera flash.</p>

<p>When light from the flash enters your eyes under these conditions, <strong>your pupils are unable to contract fast enough</strong> (full constriction takes a few seconds) to prevent the <strong>light from reflecting back</strong>, off of the red blood vessels <strong>of the <em>choroid</em></strong>. The choroid plexus nourishes the retina, and therefore contains ample blood supply. As a result, the camera will pick up the red reflection, resulting in the red-eye effect. Interestingly, due to their increased “dark adaptation,” children more commonly have red eyes in photographs.</p>

<p>The amount of melanin, a light-absorbing pigment in the eye, also has a role in the red-eye effect. Individuals with <strong>lower levels of melanin</strong> will absorb less and thus <strong>reflect more light</strong>, explaining the high incidence of the red-eye effect in albinos.</p>

<p>Though the cause of this effect is wired in the biology of the eye, some cameras can reduce red-eye by sending a few preliminary flashes before the final flash to give the <strong>pupils enough time to contract</strong> and adapt to the increased-light conditions. Another way to reduce the effect is to avoid looking directly into the camera lens, which will reduce the reflection of light. Finally, if all else fails, modern image editing software, such as Photoshop, can remove the red discoloration.</p>

<p>With regard to why dogs and other animals may not have red-eyes but other colors, this was indeed answered in your <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27621/why-do-dogs-eyes-glow-green-on-a-photo"">linked question</a>: some animal species have a <strong><em>tapetum lucidum</em>, which is situated in front of the choroid and reflects light back</strong> onto the retina thereby increasing light sensitivity. In dogs it is green, as aptly shown in the <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27621/why-do-dogs-eyes-glow-green-on-a-photo"">linked question</a>'s answer. The following figure shows the anatomy and the position of the <em>tapetum</em> in front of the <em>choroid</em>. It was adapted from Pets.SE with the related question ""<a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/6450/should-i-be-concerned-that-my-dogs-right-eye-is-reflecting-green-in-the-dark-wh"">Should I be concerned that my dog's right eye is reflecting green in the dark when his left eye doesn't?</a>""</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k7XmH.png"" alt=""eye""></p>

<p>Hence, the reason why animals with a <em>tapetum lucidum</em> have another eye color is that light does not reach the <strong><em>choroid</em></strong> in these species, giving rise to green-eye effects in dogs and cats (picture taken from <a href=""http://www.asknature.org/strategy/2908eded592a0000549595ee148c904c#.VNQiRp2VLiE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ask Nature</a>):</p>

I have heard that NH<sub>3</sub> damages the brain. What does it actually do?</p>
","<p>The denaturing effect of Urea is mostly at very high concentrations.   (~Molar levels)!  </p>

<p>Physiologically, urea, a product of the breakdown of retired amino acids, will build up rather quickly if it weren't secreted in the urine. Looking into this, it doesn't seem as there is a clear understanding of why this causes a disease, though the buildup of a waste product definitely is a unifying concept. </p>

<p>Uremia - kidney failure - causes a build up of urea in the blood as the kidney eliminates urea from the blood into the bladder.  The specific effects of Urea on cell metabolism are probably numerous as the symptoms:  anorexia and lethargy, and late symptoms can include decreased mental acuity and coma. Other symptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, cold, bone pain, itch, shortness of breath, and seizures.</p>

<p>Being a metabolic waste product, it certainly would interfere with and inhibit any enzyme that produced urea - the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle"" rel=""nofollow"">Urea cycle</a> in particular.  Its clear that uremia is ultimately associated with cell death, oxidative stress, some cell signalling and proliferation.  </p>

"What is immunopanning (vs. immunoprecipitation and FACS)?","5551","","<p>I had never heard the term before today. From what I can tell, it's using antibodies to purify a cell population of interest. I would appreciate more details, especially in how it differs from ""immunoprecipitation"" of cells via cell surface markers, and FACS.</p>
","<p>Immunopanning is essentially an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation"" rel=""nofollow"">immunoprecipitation</a> (IP) of cells using an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"" rel=""nofollow"">antibody</a> immobilized to a solid surface, like a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"" rel=""nofollow"">cell culture</a> plate. Conventionally, an IP is performed using small agarose or magnetic beads (~50 to 150μm in size) conjugated to an antibody or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_A/G"" rel=""nofollow"">Protein A/G</a>, and can pull down individual proteins, protein complexes, and/or nucleic acid complexes. </p>

<p>Cells are much larger than protein complexes, obviously, and for the most part much smaller than beads, but they can be damaged during a traditional IP, so immunopanning utilizes a single solid surface coated with the specific antibody or cell-surface protein ligand of choice. In <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18701692?dopt=Abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> (free PDF <a href=""http://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/33/8294.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axoplasmic_transport#Retrograde_transport"" rel=""nofollow"">retrograde axonal transport</a> was used to selectively label specific populations of neuronal cells with the extracellular portion of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_toxin"" rel=""nofollow"">cholera toxin β</a> (CTB) adsorbed to fluorescent beads, then the cells were purified using an immobilized anti-CTB antibody.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence-activated_cell_sorting#Fluorescence-activated_cell_sorting_.28FACS.29"" rel=""nofollow"">Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting</a> or FACS is another way to purify cell populations. Cells are labeled with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorophore"" rel=""nofollow"">fluorescent marker</a> (either conjugated to an antibody specific to an extra-cellular <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"" rel=""nofollow"">epitope</a>, via absorption as in the example above, or by expression of a fluorescent <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgene"" rel=""nofollow"">transgene</a> like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein"" rel=""nofollow"">GFP</a>), then scanned in a flow cytometer. Cells which match certain parameters or ""gates"" in the machine's software are then diverted into a separate collection chamber, allowing for the generation of a quite pure cell population. </p>

<p>However, as the authors point out in their paper above, FACS requires an expensive piece of equipment (can be over US$100,000), can be harsh on the cells, and is dependent on the availability of an antibody to a cell surface marker specific to the desired population of cells. Immunopanning is much less expensive, is more gentle on the cells, and in the authors' case was really the only choice for purifying their cell population of interest, as no specific biomarkers were available. It certainly won't replace FACS in the long run, but is another tool for investigators to use when studying specific cell types.</p>

"Why are pili more common in Gram negative bacteria than in Gram positive?","5548","","<p>Although pili have been observed in some species of Gram positive bacteria, the preliminary research that I have done indicates that pili are significantly more common in Gram negative bacteria.</p>

<p>Is this an accurate assessment of the current body of scientific knowledge? If so, do we know (or have any leading theories on) <em>why</em> this is the case?</p>
","<p>Pili were at least discovered more recently in gram-positive bacteria.</p>

<p>Pili are formed differently in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  Here's a pretty good review on the differences: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18953686"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18953686</a></p>

<p>Researchers seem to think that pili might be involved in adhesion/formation of biofilms (adhesion is important for pathogenicity).  Certain types of pili are specifically involved in gene transfer. This is a good review on pili and pathogencity in gram-positive bacteria: <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v4/n7/pdf/nrmicro1443.pdf"">http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v4/n7/pdf/nrmicro1443.pdf</a>.

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilin"">Wikipedia entry for pilin</a> interprets the second paper I linked as saying that pili <em>are</em> more common in gram-negative bacteria and that pili are implicated in pathogenicity.</p>

<p>Straight from the paper:</p>

<p>Prevalence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past five decades, several distinct pilus types 
  have been identified, most of which were described 
  and characterized in Gram-negative bacteria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Function:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A common feature of Gram-negative pili, however, is their role in adhesion to eukaryotic cells. It has been 
  proposed that bacteria use these structures to form an 
  initial association with host cells, which can then be 
  followed by a more ‘intimate’ attachment that brings 
  the bacterium into proximity to the host-cell surface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pilus-like structures on the surface of Gram-positive 
  bacteria were first detected in Corynebacterium renale, 
  by electron microscopy. More recently, surface 
  appendages were reported to be present in Actinomyces naeslundii
   and were subsequently found in other 
  species, including Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Streptococcus parasanguis (Streptococcus parasanguinis), Streptococcus salivarius
   and Streptococcus sanguis (Streptococcus sanguinis). Finally, in the past 
  year, pili were also characterized in all three of the 
  principal streptococcal pathogens that cause invasive 
  disease in humans — group A Streptococcus (GAS; that 
  is, Streptococcus pyogenes), group B Streptococcus (GBS; 
  that is, Streptococcus agalactiae) and Streptococcus 
  pneumoniae — <em><strong>in which they have been shown to 
  have key roles in the adhesion and invasion process and

","<p>So, to make cells from scratch you would need: amphiphilic molecules to form a membrane, a decent mix of simple molecules (sugars, nucleic acids, peptides) that serve as reactant and building blocks for more complex things, some simple catalyzer (metals, minerals, pepetides, aptamers, etc..) to run the reactions, enough energy to maintain lots of reactions running and keep them far from the equilibrium. Of course, lots of time...</p>

<p>An even more minimalistic approach would use a single molecule to do the enzymatic job while storing evolvable informations. In this case RNA alone has been proposed as substitute for proteins and DNA in a very minimal cell. In theory also DNA alone could do the same. However the minimal tasks needed to be done: maintain the self (to be compartimentalized), to grow (to have a flux of molecule not in equilibrium), to divide, to maintain the information stably enough to be useful for the next generation and at the same time prone too mutability to evolve.</p>

<p>One more point. Life itself doesn't strictly require to be compartmentalized.
You can think of a network of chemical reactions that have the ability to grow, to replicate its components etc but without a cell membrane. However I think that a cell-like form of life is somewhat more likely to happen. </p>

"Height and natural selection in humans?","5522","","<p>I watched the documentary ""Evolve"" recently and in the segment on ""size"" Scott V. Edwards, Harvard evolutionary biologist mentioned the idea that humans might evolve to be 7' tall in 'hundreds of years'. (I think this may have been taken out of context... I have emailed him to find out, but do not expect a response from someone so busy)</p>

<p>The reasoning goes that the trend in the past 100 years has been greater height, and women show a strong preference for men who are taller than they are. (Though a large share perhaps all of this difference has been due to diets higher in protein at an early age) </p>

<p>I wonder, though, if this is only part of the story. The preference women have is not just for tall men, but for a man who is taller than she is. Likewise, men seem to prefer woman who are shorter than they are. There is even cultural pressure: the classic western image of a couple on wedding cake always shows a man who is about 4"" (to scale) taller than the bride.</p>

<p>Thus, women who are short have an advantage as they have a greater pool of men to choose from. (Colloquially, simply ask any 6' tall woman if she feels her height helps her find dates.) </p>

<p>Let's say that men seek women who are shorter than they are, but no more than 8"" shorter. Women seek men who are taller than they are but no more than 8"" taller. Given that the current average height for men is 5'8"" and for women it is 5'4"" (and distributed normally SD 2.8"") will we have selective pressure that leads to greater or lesser height? (This is, obviously, oversimplified, but it is a starting point.)</p>
","<p>@kate has what is probably the more correct answer for the observed pattern. </p>

<p>But as an experiment, I set up a basic simulation to approximate the conditions that you lay out:</p>

<ol>
<li>Starting mean heights of 5'8"" (172.72 cm) and 5'4"" (162.56 cm) with standard deviations of 2.8"" (7.112 cm). I used cm, because it's easier than dealing with inches.</li>
<li>Males will not mate with females that are taller than themselves.</li>
<li>Females will not mate with males more than 8"" taller.</li>
<li>Males will not mate with females more then 8"" shorter (follows from #3 above).</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem that I quickly ran into was that, by truncating part of the normal distribution, the variance in height at each generation gradually decreased. After about 20 generations, the means weren't evolving because there was so little variation in height.</p>

<p>Human height is one of the most studied quantitative traits, going back over 100 years to some of the very first statisticians (Fisher, Galton). Height is a polygenic trait with very high heritability (<em>h</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.8)<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21340692"">1</a></sup>. Genome-wide association studies have reported 54 genes involved in determination of human height<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18443579"">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Imagine that each of these 54 genes has just two alleles: a and b. a gives a +1 to height. b gives a -1 to height. So aa would be +2, ab or ba 0, and bb -2. The sum of all those alleles is correlated to height. So if all 54 were aa, then the height would be +108.</p>

<p>The problem comes in when people only mate with taller people. Over time, the proportion of b's will decrease, and the proportion of a's will increase, but only to a point. Once all the alleles are fixed at a, there won't be any room left. The genetic variation will be exhausted. Without the input of new alleles, height will cease to evolve.</p>

"Why do we need red blood cells?","5506","","<p>From what I know, the main function of red blood cells is hemoglobin transport. So, why do we need cells packed with hemoglobin: why can't it travel freely in the bloodstream? </p>

<p>My own thoughts were: </p>

<p>1) Having hemoglobin packed into cells means it can be released where it's most needed. For example, when we are exercising, our muscles need more oxygen, so more erythrocytes release their oxygen in the muscle tissue. </p>

<p>2) The diameter of a capillary is much bigger than a single protein molecule's diameter, but comparable to a cell's diameter. So, when cells are traveling through a capillary, all of them are close to its walls. However, when free molecules are traveling through it, some of them are close to the walls, while the others are in the ""middle"". I figured, those in the ""middle"" can't exchange oxygen with the surrounding tissues. So, red blood cells make gas exchange more effective.    </p>

<p>Do you think any of this makes sense? Why in reality do RBCs exist? </p>

<p>Any insight or book recommendations would be very appreciated:) </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Hemoglobin molecules used to manufacture these products are not

  release of proinflammatory mediators and potent vasoconstrictors, and
  a loss of platelet inactivation,17- 20 creating conditions that may
  lead to vascular thrombosis of the heart or other organs. This

  <p>Unlike naturally occurring hemoglobin, manufactured cell-free

  cross-linking, polymerization, or pegylation of hemoglobin will create
  larger, more stable HBBS molecules, preventing extravasation and
  thereby leading to a reduction in toxicities related to nitric oxide
  scavenging. At least 1 manufacturer has also chemically increased the

<p>So cell free hemoglobin is toxic.

<p>Btw. I agree with rhill45, I think too that it is easier to regulate O2 and CO2 exchange if you have a specialized cell type, so it might have regulation purposes. It can have recycling purposes either, because it is hard to distinguish between old (damaged) and new HGB when they are in a cell-free form.

<p>Other sources claim the same, with the extension that this period lasts only for a short time, because the cell soon loses its mRNA and so it stops producing HGB. So according to these articles RBCs create the HGBs in the early stages of their life. (I did not find a real scientific article about this, but I can accept this theory.)</p>

<p>According to Chris this toxicity is just a protection mechanism, so I dug deeper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bacterial virulence is greatly enhanced by freely available iron, such
  as that in fully-saturated transferrin or free haemoglobin. Following
  trauma a fall in tissue Eh and pH due to ischaemia, plus the reducing
  powers of bacteria, can make iron in transferrin freely available and
  abolish the bactericidal properties of tissue fluids with disastrous
  results for the host. Hyperbaric oxygen is a possible therapeutic
  measure that could restore normal bactericidal systems in infected
  tissues by raising the Eh and pH.</p>

<p>So RBCs protect the iron against microbial pathogens, that's their key role. I think every other related problem, like O2 release regulation, free HGB toxicity, HGB recycling, etc... can be solved with free HGB as well, so most probably iron protection is the evolutionary pressure to store HGB in blood cells instead of letting it be in the blood in a cell free form. It's funny that every single book gets this wrong, and they claim that carrying oxygen is the most important role of this cell type, while they aren't mention anything about iron protection... :-)</p>

"How to make µg/ml concentrations of proteinase-K?","5446","","<p><strong><em>How does one prepare concentrations in the mass/volume (weight/volume) form, for substances like nucleic acids or in this case, proteinase? A detailed example would be helpful.</em></strong></p>

<p>I need to prepare squishing buffer for a DNA extraction /PCR exercise to help me learn the materials better for a in class ""internship"".</p>

<p>The squishing buffer recipe I found from a laboratory class manual describes it as: 10 mM of Tris-Cl, pH 8.2, 1 mM of EDTA, 25 mM of NaCl , and 200 µg/ml of proteinse K (freshly diulted).</p>

<p>I understand molarity concentrations well enough. One only has to determine the total molar mass of a substance, in this case NaCl, and with that molar mass (g/mol) then use the given desired molarity (in this case 25 mM of NaCl, which equals 0.025 mol /one liters) to get the number of grams of the substance needed. In this case, since we need 0.025 moles / 1 Liter, we would need to multiply that by the molar mass to get: (g/mol) X (mol/l) = g/l of NaCl.</p>

<p>I understand percent solutions (to a degree) as well. If I  needed 1% agrose gel, I would take 1 gram of agarose solid powder and bring that to 100 ml total to obtain a 1%, either using water or buffer?</p>

<p>I am having trouble understanding the concepts of concentration, in reference to mg/ml. </p>

<p>From what I understand, µg/ml is a weight (mass)/volume type of concentration. Therefore, should it be the case that if I wanted to prepare
200 µg/ml of proteinase (freshly diluted), how would I go about it? Would I add 5 ml of deionized water to get a working volume of 1000 µg of proteinase per 5 ml of water, which would be equivalent to 1 mg of proteinase per 5 ml of water. From that 1mg of proteinase to 5ml of water, should I then draw 0.2 µl (or 200 ml) of solution to then have the 200 µg/ml? Or am I totally wrong? I tried googling for more information, but I became more and more confused.</p>
","<p>It depends on what form your proteinase K is in.</p>

<hr>

<p>You may have a stock solution of some concentration, in which case you just add a specific volume according to $C_1V_1=C_2V_2$. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Let's say you want to prepare 5 mL ($V_2$) of 200 µg/mL ($C_2$) proteinase K from a stock of 1000 µg/mL ($C_1$). You're looking for the volume of stock solution to add ($V_1$).</p>

<p>$$V_1=\frac{5\ mL\ \cdot \ 200\ \mu g/mL}{1000\ \mu g/mL}=1\ mL$$</p>

<p>So you take 1 mL of the stock and bring it up to 5 mL.</p>

<hr>

<p>Or you may have a lyophilized powder. In this case, you have two options:</p>

<p>1) You can make a stock solution from the powder and, again, use $C_1V_1=C_2V_2$. This has the advantage of not having to weigh the powder every time you need to use it. This may not be a viable option, however, as I'm not sure of the stability of proteinase K in solution.</p>

<p>2) You can just weigh out the amount that will give you the desired concentration (which depends on the volume of buffer you're making).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Again, you want to prepare 5 mL of 200 µg/mL proteinase K. The total mass you need is:</p>

<p>$$200\ \mu g / mL\ \cdot \ 5\ mL=1000\ \mu g$$</p>

<p>So weigh out a milligram and bring it up to 5 mL.</p>

<hr>

<p>There's nothing special about mass concentration; you can convert it to molarity given the molecular weight of proteinase K. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinase_K"" rel=""nofollow"">According to Wikipedia</a>, proteinase K is 28.9 kDa or 28900 g/mol. If you are making this conversion, however, make sure you find the actual molecular weight of the protein you're using. 200 µg/mL is equal to:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As already discussed by me and @SatwikPasani in the comments, increasing telomere longevity in eukaryotes by reducing the length of okazaki fragments, and consequently reducing the part of telomere cut-off after every division might be another reason for having shorter fragments in eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes which do not contain telomeres.</p>

<p>These proteins are all in human, and yet their recommended names are not all caps; what's up with that? But even more confusing to me are the ""C-"", ""N-"", and ""L-"" letters prefixed to them. What in the world are those supposed to be indicating?</p>

<p>Are these all fundamentally different proteins (coded by different genes), but maybe related somehow to each other (thus the common three letters, 'myc' even if they are not all the same case and not all upper case as I thought was supposed to be the case in human), and they are just given these ""C-"", ""N-"", and ""L-"" tags to distinguish one from the other? Does one tag indicate an oncogene or a proto-oncogene? Why do I sometimes see ""c-Myc"" and other times, ""C-Myc""? Does the case of the ""C-"" mean something? Is there some kind of key or legend I can look at to get answers to all these questions? I've found some explanations in Scott Gilbert's <em>Developmental Biology</em> textbook, but it still doesn't give me all the answers I seek here</p>

<p>I just want to understand how these tags and symbols are being used because it seems to me that when I read research papers (of which I've read many), they are used by different authors in different papers in ways that are not consistent with each other. Either that, or else I'm missing something very basic, which is why I'm asking here.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
","<p>That's a good question, and honestly, the nomenclature for genes and their coded proteins is somewhat abused in scientific literature. For example, when referring to microbes (like E. coli), gene names are all lowercase (eg, lacZ). The problem of protein names is compounded when the protein name is (often) an abbreviation.</p>

<p>With respect to myc, it can refer to the family of MYC transcription factor proteins (of which, c-Myc, L-myc and N-myc are members). More commonly, myc refers to c-Myc, and is the name given to a 10-amino acid segment of human proto-oncogene myc (EQKLISEEDL) and is a common epitope added to recombinant DNA for making fusion proteins.</p>

<p>From what I recall, the initial that precedes myc (in this instance) refers to what form of cancer that myc protein is associated with.

"How do marine mammals control buoyancy?","5420","","<p>Presumably, as a whale or seal dives, its lungs get compressed by the increasing water pressure, and it gets less buoyant.</p>

<p>Under this model, for a given amount of air taken in at the surface, the animal has a very specific depth D at which it is neutrally buoyant. Any deeper, and the lungs shrink, making it negatively buoyant. Any shallower, and the lungs expand, making it positively buoyant. </p>

<p>In other words, until it reaches depth D, the animal is positively buoyant. To get to depth D, the animal would have to do a lot of work swimming down, fighting against its own floatiness. </p>

<p>The amount of air that keeps you neutrally buoyant at 10 meters will inflate to twice the volume once you surface, keeping you pinned there. Speaking as a scuba diver, I can say that it would take a lot of work to dive back down to 10 meters. (We deflate our air vests at the surface and re-inflate at depth from our incompressible tanks, something animals don't have.)</p>

<p>For very deep divers like sperm whales, swimming down against positive buoyancy seems like a huge energy waste, the kind that one might expect wouldn't be tolerated long by evolution.</p>

<p>So do marine mammals do anything to compensate for the effect of fluctuating lung size on their buoyancy? One guess is that they actually exhale fully before diving, thus making lung buoyancy a small player in the overall body buoyancy. Another guess is that they compress the air with their chest muscles at the surface in order to sink. These are just guesses; I'd love to hear the real story.</p>
","<p>From what I can tell, <strong>marine mammals can't dynamically control buoyancy during a dive</strong>. They ease the beginning of the dive by starting with a small lung volume to reduce buoyancy. </p>

<p><code>V</code> is lung volume, <code>Vs</code> is lung volume at surface, and <code>D</code> is depth in meters.</p>

<p>At 90m, the lungs are already at 10% original volume. Pretty soon they've shrunk enough that their effect on buoyancy is negligible compared to the density of the incompressible tissues.

<p>From the statement that there are fewer genes on the Y chromosome, one can conclude that men have fewer genes copies than woman.</p>

<p>This is the intuition the OP seemed to have.</p>

<p><strong>2. Number of genes</strong></p>

<p>Men also have an X chromosome. So men have the standard genes present on the X chromosome (but they only have a single copy of it while women have two copies; btw you might be interested in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosage_compensation"" rel=""noreferrer"">dosage compensation</a>).</p>

<p>Because women do not have a Y chromosome and because there are a number of genes on the Y chromosome that are not present on the X chromosome, men have genes that female don't have at all. Therefore women have fewer genes than men.</p>

<p><strong>3. Number of alleles</strong></p>

<p>There is not much reason to expect that one gender would be more heterozygote than the other at autosomes (=non sexual chromosomes). Some may hypothesize that women may have more heterozygosity than men if there is stronger selection among sperm than among ovules or things like that but let's not get down this complicated path.</p>

<p>One one hand women have more gene copies and therefore might experience more heterozygosity, one the other hand, men have more genes and would therefore eventually carry more alleles. I don't know which side wins!</p>

<p><strong>Did you mean number of genes per cell or per individual?</strong></p>

<p>So far I assumed you were interested about the number of genes (or gene copies) per cells but if you want to compare whole individuals than it is a different story!</p>

<p>Men are on average taller and therefore have more cells. Therefore if you compare the body-wide number of gene copies, women will have fewer gene copy on average (Thanks to @JM97 comment).</p>

It is selective, and quickly kills the dicot weeds, while other plants are unharmed.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGMsm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>2,4-D is a synthetic auxin, a class of plant hormones. It is gets taken in through the stomata on the leaves, and is transported to the meristems of the plant. This causes uncontrolled, unsustainable growth, and the plant wilts, and dies.</p>

<p>Why doesn't this affect most monocotyledons?</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2011/111122MurphyTransporter.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this link</a> from Purdue, the seed of the answer is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The herbicide is used to kill broadleaf weeds, which are dicots, while monocot grasses, such as sorghum and corn, are more resistant. That's because grasses inactivate 2,4-D inside the plant, while broadleaf dicots do not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But on the other hand, <a href=""http://sourcedb.cas.cn/sourcedb_xtbg_cas/yw/ywlw/201312/P020131220579582246464.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Song 2014</a> has this to say about 2,4-D:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, the underlying molecular mechanism of how auxinic herbicides selectively kill
  dicots and spare monocots is not
  understood yet (Grossmann 2000; Kelley
  and Riechers 2007; McSteen 2010). The mechanisms of auxin biosynthesis, transport,
  and signal transduction
  are conserved in monocots and dicots make this question more complex (McSteen 2010). Early research has
  proposed that the selectivity of auxinic herbicide is because of
  either limited translocation or rapid degradation
  of exogenous auxin, altered vascular anatomy, or altered perception of auxin in monocots (Monaco et al. 2002;
  Kelley and Riechers 2007). Auxin transport is influenced by plant vascular
  systems (Mattsson et al. 1999;
  Scarpella et al. 2006). The difference in vascular tissue structure between dicots
  and monocots may contribute
  to the selectivity of auxinic herbicides. In monocot
  stems, the vascular tissues (the phloem and xylem) are
  scattered in bundles, and lack a vascular
  cambium; in dicot stems, the vascular tissues are form
  ed in rings and
  possess a cambium. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in other words, we don't know yet. It seems to be very strongly tied to auxin transport, but we do not have the full mechanism of action; since auxin is such an important plant hormone, and the pathway is therefore highly conserved (that is, the genes tend to be nearly identical on the parts of the sequence that affect the phenotype), the general conclusion is that the pathway itself is not affected, but an accessory pathway clears up auxin in levels excess of any normal amount in monocots.</p>

","<p>I found <a href=""http://rbaltman.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/bioinformatics-computational-biology-same-no/"">this</a> post by Russ Altman quite good.  Below is his opinion about the two similar but distinct fields:</p>

<p>This is just one persons opinion and I have heard many other definitions for both of these terms.

"Besides hemoglobin, what proteins are present in red blood cells?","5393","","<p>I knew that mature red blood cells (RBCs) lacked nuclei, but I wasn't aware until just now that they also lacked ribosomes and mitochondria. Most cells in the human body all contain a common laundry list of housekeeping proteins and RNAs (including mitochondrial proteins and ribosomal RNAs), but I guess RBCs lack a number of them. Do they still have all of the other organelles? Obviously hemoglobin (and to a lesser extent carbonic anhydrase) makes up a large portion of the dry weight of RBCs, but are other proteins still present? If so, what are their relative abundances?</p>

<p>For example, do red blood cells have any of the normal metabolic (i.e. ATP producing) proteins? Obviously they don't have any of the TCA cycle proteins, but do they still have the glycolysis ones?</p>
","<p>Reticulocyte stage is when the ribosomes are still present and after that no new protein synthesis occurs. However RBCs have a lot of proteins and major proteins other than haemoglobin are cytoskeletal proteins and ion channels/pumps (In fact, cytoskeletal proteins are more abundant than haemoglobin). It is the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase that consumes most ATP. As you correctly identified the RBCs produce ATP via glycolysis and glycolytic enzymes are also present. Note that deficiency of pyruvate kinase leads to haemolytic anaemia. </p>

Iron is bound to transferrin, and any cell with transferrin receptors can internalise the transferrin and take the iron.

During starvation the liver produces ketones (""ketone bodies"") which are taken up by many different tissues/cell types.</p>

Am I missing something and is my girlfriend correct?</p>

<p>I know that some tall people or some people living in Europe or US have of course bigger bones that in some Asian countries because some Asians are really small. However, this is not how most people understand ""big boned"". </p>

<p>How large is the variability in human bone thickness in persons of the same height? Could this variation mean that a person might appear overweight, when they in reality are only having relatively thick bones (large diameter), so that the expression ""big boned"" might have some truth to it?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong></p>

<p>I'm asking about the most people perceive about the ""big boned"" thingy. Most people (like my girlfriend) sometimes touch chubby people and when they feel like it's not fat, they say ""ohh, you're not fat, you're just 'BIG BONED'"". I'm asking if there is a real health/scientific basis for that. Personally, I don't believe that 'big boned' is a real thing. However, it's hard to find information about this on the web.</p>
","<p>Since the argument with my girlfriend was finished days after this was posted(sadly we were waiting for this but it took so long, we posted this question to have an answer right away) I'll just post here what I conclude about the ""big-boned theory"" based on searching through internet. </p>

<p>Let me site this <a href=""https://sciencebasedlife.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/are-the-overweight-really-big-boned/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>; that says, 
<em>""However, the initial findings of this study show that having big bones does not make you fat, being fat gives you big bones""</em>. What the link says, having more fats forced our body to increase the size of our bones for it to endure the stress brought by having heavier weight. Which means big-boned really do exists. (Damn lost the argument with my girlfriend because of this link)</p>

<p>Another <a href=""http://www.fitnessunderoath.com/big-boned-big-myth/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">site</a> that says, ""<em>If your scale weight indicates that you’re overweight, it’s most likely because you’re carrying too much body fat.   Not because you’ve got 'big bones'""</em>. This site says that we cannot use the ""big-bone theory"" to reason out being fat. In the article, The heavier weight was caused mostly by fats and not by bones. Also the article says that tall person having 6'2 height will have of course bigger bones that a person with height of 4'2. Also the article says that <em>""Still others definitely seem to have a larger “frame” as evidenced by a larger circumference of the wrist and ankles.  [NOTE:  The wrist and ankle joints typically do not have much fat or muscle, it’s mostly skin and bone.  So a person with a larger wrist would most likely have a larger bone circumference.]""</em> (My girlfriend's face would be so happy to read this)</p>

<p>The last <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/03/are-you-big-boned-truth_n_6075706.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">site</a> that I would like to post here have chart to know if you're big-boned or not. The site also agrees that there is big boned</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>I lost, ""Big-boned theory"" is real but having heavier weight not mean your big-boned. </p>

<p>P.S. : Also instead of saying <em>""ohh, you're not fat, you're just 'BIG BONED'""</em> to someone just to make their feelings well, you're not doing it right! Just tell them the truth and tell them to do more exercise and have healthy lifestyle. :)</p>

"Are there animals which can see movements better than shapes or colors?","5345","","<p>I remember that in Michael Crichton's novel <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_%28novel%29"">Jurassic Park</a>, Tyrannosaurus Rex was supposed to have movement based vision. (Of course, that is a novel and not a scientific text.) </p>

<p>I have also noticed while feeding chickens, that they behave differently when they see me adding the food for them into the container as opposed to leaving it there for them when they cannot see me. (But this can be explained easily by different reasons, for example they are used to human as a source of their food, so they naturally go close to them.)</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<p><strong>Are there some kinds of animals who have primarily movement based vision? If yes, which animals are examples for this?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>The Michael Crichton's novel has been widely discussed online, I found for example <a href=""http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrannosaurus_rex#Eyesight_Debate"">this</a> and several answers at <a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061217193648AASG0Fp"">Yahoo Answers</a>. Frogs and reptiles are mentioned there. </p>
","<p>I think ""movement-based vision"" is perhaps a bit of a misnomer. Ultimately, all vision is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21092350"" rel=""nofollow"">contrast-based, depending on integrating signals from ON and OFF bipolar cells</a>. It seems that this notion of so-called ""movement-based vision"" is derived from work on toad vision and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_detection_%28nervous_system%29#Feature_detection_in_toad_vision"" rel=""nofollow"">feature detection</a>. In this case, it's more the downstream processing that results in different behavior based on the shape of the stimulus and the direction that it moves. The simple sensing of visual stimuli does not seem to be motion-based. </p>

<p>So, aside from evolutionary inference, we would have no way of knowing whether Tyranassaurus rex had such behavior. As for the chickens, it's possible but I would be skeptical of such a system discriminating between immobile food and hand pouring food. I would chalk that up to a simple behavior of associating seeing you with getting food.</p>

<p>One interesting note: many, many species have reflexive responses to moving visual stimuli. The first is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optokinetic_reflex"" rel=""nofollow"">optokinetic reflex</a>, in which the eyes reflexively track contrast-based movement; and the second is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optomotor_response"" rel=""nofollow"">optomotor response</a>, in which the head or even the whole body move in response to a moving stimulus. Thus it <em>is</em> safe to say that for many (most?) species, motion detection has a strong influence on the visual response...but again, I remain hesitant to use the phrase ""motion-based vision"".</p>

"Why do people feel pleasure when using roller coasters / centrifuges?","5325","","<p>The feeling when using an amusement park unit is usually a pleasure. Why is it not a pain instead?</p>

<p>Are there advantages, from an evolutionary point of view, in loving this potentially dangerous activity? </p>

<p>Is it related to the liking for extreme sports?</p>
","<p>Riding roller-coasters usually (unless you are psycho) induces a release of adrenaline and other chemicals, like endorphin (your bodies pre-emptive effort to combat any possible pain and stress you may be about to experience), into your body. Endorphin is a strong chemical, specifically released to make you feel relaxed and confident. Obviously this explains the natural high you may get from riding a coaster. </p>

<p>However, every now and then you get that person who ruins it for everyone by having a heart-attack. This person's body was not conditioned for this type of stress, and clearly they did not enjoy their ride much. Elevated blood pressure,
erratic heartbeat and palpitations...they should have instead taken a ride on the log flume. For the rest of us thrill-seekers, this type of gung-ho, take-all-comers attitude gives us a confidence boost by wiring our brains to not be overly stressed in actual emergencies. </p>

<p>Imagine the people out there who have grown up in small towns. You may have heard how such people can have a difficult time adjusting to the hustle and bustle of city life, especially in larger cities. This has to do with everything from their metabolism and diet, to their sleep cycle. Their body simply needs to get used to the new environment. The same goes for new combatants. Military's try their best to simulate combat for new trainees. The better the simulation, the better prepared people will be for combat. The first few combat situations for people are obviously going to be the most dangerous, being a truly foreign experience for most peoples bodies. </p>

<p>Physiologically it's going to push your body to the limit. After all, you sense your life is in serious danger. But as many people deal with this stress, they can start to acclimate until they ideally stay fearful, but become extremely focused on the fight. The adrenaline rush (and again, other chems) is part of what you need to get used to.

<p>You are correct in thinking that, because crocodiles have been around for a long time, they could have accumulated many new mutations in that time, relative to other more recent species. However, mutation is only one of the important mechanisms underlying evolution.</p>

<p><strong>How different are ancestral and modern crocodiles?</strong></p>

<p>It seems the appearance of crocodiles has been <a href=""https://www.preceden.com/timelines/44419--evolution-of-crocodiles-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fairly unchanged</a> since their occurrence <a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-top-10-greatest-survivors-of-evolution-118143319/?no-ist"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">~85 million years ago</a> (mya). </p>

<p><strong>How can they remain so unchanged?</strong></p>

<p>Genetic variation may have been low in the ancestral population, this would <a href=""http://equation-of-the-month.blogspot.se/2011/01/fishers-fundamental-theorem-on-natural.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reduce the potential for evolutionary change</a>, as most change would have to occur through new mutations. It seems the <a href=""http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/12/crocodile-genomes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">populations of ancestral crocodiles were quite small</a>, such that a <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/population-bottleneck-300"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">genetic bottleneck</a> may have occurred (which would reduce <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/bottlenecks_01"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">genetic variation</a>). <a href=""http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/302.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mutation rates seem to be relatively low in crocodiles</a> (also see <a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1254449.full-text.pdf+html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) which would reduce the rate at which novel mutation occurs, reducing the potential for evolution.</p>

<p>Note that many mutations will be neutral in their effect (or ""synonymous"") so won't have an obvious phenotypic effect, so there may be substantial evolution at the genetic level despite the phenotypic similarity. </p>

<p>Low rates of evolutionary change could suggests some other things may have also played a factor. Given that the populations have been through multiple genetic bottlenecks, genetic drift could have slowed down rates of evolution eroding genetic variance, <a href=""http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/advanced/topics/PopGenetics/Pages/mutation.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">removing rare mutations from the population</a>. </p>

<p>The simple answer would be ""there are more proteins than genes"", but I'm more interested in why. Is it sufficient to say that during gene expression a single gene codes for multiple proteins (Alternative Splicing) and ribosomes translating mRNA to polypeptide chains (Posttranslational modification)? Could someone expand more on this? </p>
","<p>There are several concepts to understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) Alternative splicing

<ul>
<li>From one gene, several proteins can be constructed depending on which introns are spliced.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2) Tisssue specific genetic expression

<ul>
<li>Genes are differentially expressed (and differentially spliced) depending on the tissue.</li>

<li>3) Post-transcriptional modifications

<li>Those are modifications that are made directly on the proteins (in opposition with alternative splicing which are modifications made on the RNA)</li>

<ul>
<li>Proteins may fold (to what we call primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures) differently in different environment.</li>

"Effects of Polyphasic vs Monophasic sleep in humans","5294","","<p>Why do humans practice monophasic sleep cycles? </p>

<p>When altering one's circadian rhythm to a Polyphasic sleep schedule, how much would that affect development?</p>

<p>Is Monophasic sleep (once per day) chosen because of biological evolution or is it due to cultural influence?</p>
","<p>Reading ""<a href=""http://www.supermemo.com/articles/polyphasic.htm#Polyphasic%20sleep"">Polyphasic Sleep: Facts and Myths</a> (Dr Piotr Wozniak)"", it is pointed out that infant humans do undergo polyphasic sleep. As this is where most of our development is obviously done, I do not know where I can further proceed with the question about how it would affect development?  Perhaps the issue is more how it would effect the day to day performance of a developed individual?  If this is the case then it is suggested by Dr Wozniak that this is likely to be highly disruptive to the individual </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those well-defined effects of natural sleep affecting stimuli on sleep patterns lead to an instant conclusion: the claim that humans can adapt to any sleeping pattern is false. A sudden shift in the schedule, as in shift work, may lead to a catastrophic disruption of sleep control mechanisms. 25% of North American population may work in variants of shift schedule. Many shift workers never adapt to shifts in sleep patterns. At times, they work partly in conditions of harmful disconnect from their body clock, and return to restful sleep once their shift returns to their preferred timing. At worst, the constant shift of the working hours results in a loss of synchrony between various physiological variables and the worker never gets any quality sleep. This propels an individual on a straight path to a volley of health problems...</p>
  
  <p><strong>It appears that polyphasic sleep encounters the precisely same problems as seen in jet lag or shift-work. Human body clock is not adapted to sleeping in patterns other than monophasic or biphasic sleep.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would therefore seem that polyphasic sleep is certainly detrimental to health, if not development.</p>

<p>However studies into cognitive performance resulting from differing sleep patterns run by Dr Claudio Stampi (Published <a href=""http://sleepwarrior.com/Claudio_Stampi_-_Why_We_Nap.pdf"">ISBN 0-8176-3462-2</a>), he concluded that polyphasic sleep was more efficient than monophasic sleep.  Therefore it may be possible that polyphasic sleep patterns have no detrimental effect on development.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Individuals sleeping for 30 minutes every four hours, for a daily total of only 3 hours of sleep, performed better and were more alert, compared to when they had 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a couple of theories mentioned in the above book (beginning pg 5) which support the development of monophasic sleep as evolution rather than a social convention:</p>

<ol>
<li>Polyphasic sleep is regularly seen in smaller mammals that have very high metabolic rates, requiring them to spend most of their time foraging or hunting.  Therefore a long sleep would be highly impractical for them as they would wake without the energy required to hunt their next meal. Humans do not have this need as they are larger and do not require such regular meals.</li>
<li>Monophasic sleep would be beneficial for the early human hunter gatherer as our eyes are not well adapted to see at night.  Therefore any time spent not using the daylight is wasted and any time without the light is not nearly as useful.  This makes it more beneficial to sleep for an extended period when the sun is down.  </li>
</ol>

<p>I am sure that social factors would have an effect, however I would imagine the evolutionary pressures to be more significant.</p>

<p>I really would recommend the book (<a href=""http://sleepwarrior.com/Claudio_Stampi_-_Why_We_Nap.pdf"">http://sleepwarrior.com/Claudio_Stampi_-_Why_We_Nap.pdf</a>) if you have not yet encountered it as I found it very informative and packed with references to studies that you may find helpful. </p>

He is a compassionate kid and wonders whether the hen goes through this pain everyday. Not being a hen, I am not sure if chickens experience pain that is close to the pain associated with giving birth.</p>
","<p>We really don't know - we can't really ask the chicken. At least, it's unlikely it's as painful as it can be with humans. </p>

<p>The reason human birth is (or can be) very painful is that the human baby's head has to fit through the woman's pelvis. Since splitting from chimpanzees, <a href=""http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/why-is-human-childbirth-so-painful"">human heads have gotten bigger, while the pelvis has gotten more narrow</a> due to adapting to walking on two legs. While chimpanzees give birth in an average of around 2 hours, humans can take over a day to do so, and the baby being too big can lead to maternal and natal death. </p>

<p>Back to chickens, while there are different sizes of eggs,  <a href=""http://www.backyardchickens.com/a/interesting-facts-about-chicken-eggs"">the larger eggs come from larger chicken breeds.</a> If it does hurt them, at least it takes a lot less time - only a few minutes.

"Alternatives to trypsin for cell detachment?","5282","","<p>I have ran out of trypsin and need to passage my cells (immortalized chondrocytes, C28/I2) today or tomorrow. I have been out of town and forgot to order more trypsin. </p>

<p>I was wondering if there are any alternative, ""homemade"" ways to detach cells. Googling this results in a lot of commercially available detachment solutions. I may or may not have a cell scraper available, but I have never tried it. I have hyaluronidase and I was thinking that might work. </p>
","<p>Lets make this a proper answer: There are a few possibilities to detach adherent cells without Trypsin.</p>

<p><strong>PBS/EDTA:</strong> Integrins and Cadherins play an important role in the adhesion and also in maintaining cell-cell contacts. These function of these proteins depends on Calcium<sup>2+</sup> ions, so EDTA will chelate them and make them unavailable. First remove the culture media, rinse the cells with warm PBS to get rid of most ions and then incubate them for 5 min (the time needs to be optimized for each cells line) in PBS with 10mM EDTA in it. The cells either detach themself, can be washed of the surface with a pipette or can be gently knocked off the surface (this works only in tightly closing flasks). Centrifuge the cells shortly to pellet them and get rid of the PBS/EDTA and take them up in fresh medium.</p>

<p><strong>Wash cells of the surface:</strong> Some cell lines are so loosely attached (which makes working with them pretty hard), that they can simply be washed off the surface. To do so, use the pipetboy to get some medium and then pump it out again against the cell layer. You can see the cells disappearing from the surface and the medium (or the PBS) get more cloudy.</p>

<p><strong>Knock off cells:</strong> To do so, you take the flask with medium in one hand and knock it gently 4 or 5 times against the palm of the other hand. The cells should come off then and can be centrifuged down to separate from the medium. Alternatively you could replace the medium first and then knock them off. This method is not recommended for very sensitive cell lines.</p>

<p>Besides these methods, there are a number of commercial products available which claim to be better than the classical Trypsin/EDTA method and to be less harmful for the cells. Since I haven't tested them, I cannot say anything about them. In my experience Trypsin and the methods described above work perfectly.</p>

<p>If there is some ""visual attractiveness selection criteria"", <strong>is there a requirement of certain complexity of the brain and/or visual system for an animal before this phenomenon starts to occur?</strong> </p>

","<p>There are numerous examples of visual attraction in animals.

He experimentally manipulated the tail lengths of male widowbirds at random. Some tails were made longer and some shorter. From this experiment Andersson showed that females choose males with longer tails more preferentially. Another classic example is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek_mating"" rel=""nofollow"">lek mating system</a> where there is a bias in reproductive success towards attractive males, in some cases <a href=""http://www.sfu.ca/biology/faculty/reynolds/The_Reynolds_Lab/Publications_files/Mackenzie%20et%20al.%20AN%2095.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">10-20% of the males get 70-80% of the matings</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lek is an aggregation of males that gather to engage in competitive
  displays that may entice visiting females who are surveying
  prospective partners for copulation. Leks are commonly formed
  before or during the breeding season. A lekking species is defined by
  the following characteristics: male displays, <strong>strong female mate
  choice</strong>, and the conferring of male indirect benefits. Although
  lekking is most prevalent among avian species, lekking behavior is
  found in a variety of animals such as insects, amphibians, and
  mammals</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Indicator traits</strong> are those that <strong>signal good overall quality of the
  individual</strong>. Traits that are perceived as attractive must reliably
  indicate broad genetic quality in order for selection to favor them
  and for preference to evolve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm sure there are some studies in fish, likely guppies or zebra fish, which gave individual fish the opportunity to visually assess potential mates (placing tanks next to each other and observing courtship) which would be very similar to your hypothetical duck example. <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-3820%281982%2936:1%3C1:SSATEO%3E2.0.CO;2-9&amp;origin=ISI"" rel=""nofollow"">Despite often being a paradox, female mate choice is well documented.</a> Further, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_choice#Male_mate_choice.2FSex_role_reversal"" rel=""nofollow"">male mate choice</a> is now coming to light, <a href=""http://bonduriansky.net/BR-2001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">even in species where female mate choice and male-male competition exists</a>.</p>

<p>I don't think selection on ""beauty"" would require some kind of particularly special neural system, obviously some visual capacity is necessary for visual attraction and some basic neural pathways linked to that. I have done experiments myself in <em>Drosophila simulans</em> which looked at good gene benefits of mating with attractive males (indirect genetic benefits of female mate choice) and another which assessed precopulatory selection (female mate choice) for a secondary sexual character in the same species. Even in such a small-brained species there appears to be some degree of (partially visual) mate choice going on.</p>

They also have less efficient muscles (i.e. the muscles themselves can't breakdown energy as well, use it as well and the body isn't as great at picking the right set of muscles)</p></li>
<li><p>The fat itself can compress vessels carrying blood. This pressure increases blood pressure. This is worsened by a typical high diet of salt and again by typical lack of exercise. Higher blood pressure means the heart has to beat harder and faster to pump blood around the body</p></li>
<li><p>They weigh more so each movement requires A LOT more energy. Their resting metabolic rate is higher than a thinner person as is any exercise they do. </p></li>
<li><p>On exercise they do not lose heat fast enough. This impairs the breakdown of glucose and also more energy is required to lose the excess heat</p></li>

"Transcription and translation of prokaryotic operons","5253","","<p>I'm taking a molecular genetics course, and we're currently discussing prokaryotic operons. The lacZ operon came up frequently for me as an undergraduate as an example for teaching regulatory control of transcription, and the focus was always on determining whether the operon was transcribed under certain conditions (mutations, nutrients, etc). I don't remember much discussion about what happens after transcription. Today, however, I noticed something I had never seen before: three of the genes in the lacZ operon are transcribed simultaneously on the same transcript--I don't know how I missed this before!</p>

<p>My question is what happens post-transcription. Obviously there are 3 protein products. How are these products derived from the transcript? Is the transcript broken into 3 pieces, or does a single ribosome translate all 3 proteins from a single transcript substrate, or do ribosomes translate a single protein from a single transcript substrate at a time? Where could I find the relevant literature that elucidated the translation process?</p>
","<p>As you pointed out, the repressor gene lacI is transcribed as a one mRNA, and three structural genes: lacZ, lacY and lacA are transcribed into a single polycistronic mRNA. The two mRNAs are translated independently of one another.</p>

<p>The polycisronic mRNA is not broken into pieces. Rather, it is translated by ribosomes (at least three, explanation below), giving rise to three individual proteins.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SyweF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>How from one mRNA three protein products are translated? The polycistronic DNA consists of a promotor (Plac), which ensures that transcription will be initiated, and three open reading frames (ORFs) for for lacZ, lacY, and lacA. Upstream of each of the ORFs, ribosome binding sites (RBSs) are located. Translation is initiated by the binding of the ribosome with both the RBS and the start codon. Thus, multiple ribosomes can bind upstream of the three ORFs and thus resulting into three proteins.</p>

<p>There is not very thorough literature on the translation of polycistronic RNA in prokaryotes, mainly because the condition which is necessary for translation is the RBS and there is nothing specific for polycistronic translation. A brief overview on the subject can be found in several places, as I recommend the following:</p>

"Which organisms have introns?","5234","","<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, introns are extremely common within the nuclear genome of higher vertebrates (e.g. humans and mice), where protein-coding genes almost always contain multiple introns, while introns are rare within the nuclear genes of some eukaryotic microorganisms,[8] for example baker's/brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In contrast, the mitochondrial genomes of vertebrates are entirely devoid of introns, while those of eukaryotic microorganisms may contain many introns. <strong>Introns are well known in bacterial and archaeal genes, but occur more rarely than in most eukaryotic genomes.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my biochemistry course we learned that bacteria have no introns and eukaryots nearly always have them. What's correct?</p>

<p>Do viruses have introns as the Wikipedia article claims?</p>
","<p>As a general rule, a blanket statement in Biology should always be considered false.</p>

<p>It so happens that bacteria do have 'introns' (or at least the intron genomic sequence has been determined) in the sense of the cis-acting autocatalytic Group I and II introns. These are sequences of RNA that adopt such a conformation to catalyze their own excision from an mRNA transcript, and thus may be considered ribozymes, enzyme made of ribonucleic acid.</p>

<p>Although not generally considered 'introns' segments of RNA are removed during the course of tRNA in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.</p>

<p>Now introns that are removed by the action of the spliceosome are strictly found in eukaryotes, as bacteria lack the spliceosome.</p>

<p>There seem to be a considerable number of papers regarding the question of intron (particularly spliceosomal) phylogeny that should be relatively easy to find if you are so interested.</p>

"Why did humans lose their fur?","5232","","<p>The little amount of body hair humans have don't seem to be of much use for keeping warm.
Our Simian cousins on the other hand sport thick furs.</p>

<p>At which point during the species evolution and why did humans lose their fur?</p>
","<p>This is an interesting question, and there are a number hypotheses available to explain this phenomenon. The short answer (as far as I can say this after my literature search) is that we don't know the answer for sure. The long version follows below.</p>

<p>The main problem with all these hypothesis is that they have some valid point, but a definitive hasn't been given yet. All these hypotheses are listed in the first reference, with a ton of additional references in the paper. I will summarize the different hypotheses only shortly here, for details please read the paper. The second reference is also interesting.</p>

<p>The point when this process started is after we the last common ancestor of chimpanzee and humans divided into both lines. Chimpanzees are our closest relatives and still have hairs, so this process must have started afterwards. Analyzes of MC1R mutations (which affect pigmentation) suggest that human are hairless for at least 1.2 million years. See reference 3 for details here.</p>

<p><strong>Aquatic ape hypothesis (also known as aquatic ape theory):</strong> This hypothesis states that the modern humans spent some time semi-aquatic. In this lifestyle fur is not insulating very good and this led to an evolutionary disadvantage. </p>

<p><strong>Cooling hypothesis:</strong> This hypothesis states that the modern humans lost their hairs when then left the forests and started to live in the savannah. There they got too warm with their fur and finally lost it. This hypothesis sounds logic on the first thought, but contains a few problems. Naked humans have two problems, at the day they collect quite some heat over their skin which requires them to have a cooling system (we sweat to cool us), in cold nights we need a lot of internal energy to keep our temperature stable. Insulation however works both ways (not only keeps warm in, but also can keep heat out), and indeed some savannah monkey have a denser fur than their relatives in the forest. The cooling system will also lead to water loss and potential dehydration.</p>

<p><strong>Hunting hypothesis:</strong> This hypothesis states that humans started to be carnivores and therefore had the need to run extended periods of time to hunt for meat. This leads to thermal overload, without a fur they can release this heat much faster without overheating.</p>

<p><strong>Bipedality hypothesis:</strong> This hypothesis assumes that modern humans, walking on two feed have a lower direct influx of solar radiation. This lowers the chance for overheating.</p>

<p><strong>Allometry hypothesis:</strong> Allometry states that species which get bigger during evolution, do not have all their organs getting bigger at the same rate. The hypothesis states that humans got bigger, the number of hairs stayed the same and finally got lost.</p>

<p><strong>Clothing hypothesis:</strong> One of the more unlogic hypothesis, which assumes that hair loss wasn't critical for humans, as they managed to make themselves clothes.</p>

<p><strong>Vestiary hypothesis:</strong> A mix of the cooling and the clothing hypothesis: Here it is assumed that hair loss is beneficial due to more cooling and that the negative effects of too much loss of heat is saved by the invention of artificial insulation.</p>

<p><strong>Neoteny hypothesis:</strong> Neoteny denotes the retention of of juvenile physical characteristics in adults. Humans are characterized as retarded in development (compared to the apes) and matures slower. Additional it is assumed that some characteristics (here loss of hair) of juvenile or foetal apes are maintained.</p>

<p><strong>Carrion-eating hypothesis:</strong> Another strange hypothesis, which assumes, that man as messy eater (like condors, which also have naked necks) have an advantage of being hairless.</p>

<p><strong>Sex-related hypothesis:</strong> This hypothesis assumes that hairless skin is more sensitive to stimuli like touch, temperature and pain. This would allow a more sensitive social contacts, especially between man and woman, but also between woman and child. Pubic hair is not explained by this hypothesis.</p>

<p><strong>Adaptation-against-ectoparasites hypothesis:</strong> Here it is assumed, that naked humans are less prone to harbour ticks, fleas and other parasites which hide and live within fur. Apes have great social rituals of removing these within their group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can determine the approximate shape of your visual field by looking straight ahead, and holding a hand out to each side and noticing where you can no longer see them. Do the same for above and below, and you'll see that your peripheral vision probably extends to about 180 degrees (or a little less) left and right, and about 100 degrees up and down. <strong>Your brow, nose, and cheeks narrow the vertical angle.</strong> </p>
  
  <p>So your visual field has a ratio of about 1 to 1.8.</p>
  
  <p>Interestingly, and not entirely coincidentally, ordinary films and wide-screen TVs have a ratio of 1.78 (16:9).</p>

<p>Another way to see this effect is to look at someone's head in profile and from directly above. In the former  case you have a clear view of their eyes, in the latter you don't. (Tested on a small sample - one 3 year old male, playing with an iPad).</p>

"How do we know the presence of light when our eyes are closed?","5214","","<p>Last night I laid on my bed and tried to go to sleep with the light off.
I closed my eyes (but hadn't gone to sleep). My younger brother touched the wireless mouse (which had laser) for the laptop.  He wiggled the mouse and it's laser contacted my closed eye . I knew some light was thrown on my face, and it's color was red. The laser on the mouse was actually red. So my question is, when my eyes are not functioning (not seeing, closed) how did I come to know that there was a light aimed at my eyes, and it was red? </p>
","<p>There are two reasons for light to appear red through the eyelids.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Eyelids get a rich supply of blood which contains iron (in hemoglobin). The iron in blood absorbs all colors of light but reflects red light. (<a href=""http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/LabTutorials/Hemoglobin/MetalComplexinBlood.html"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Our tissue transmits red wavelengths of light very well, but it doesn't transmit blue or wavelengths of light towards the blue end of the spectrum very well. So, the blue light is absorbed by the skin, while the red light travels through. When this light hits our eye through our eyelids, it is mostly red. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8719122"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>).</p></li>

"What is MHC haplotype?","5206","","<p>What is MHC haplotype? I did check out the wiki article, but did not understand.
<br><br>
(I have not studied biology since last 8 years and now I am going through it because I need it for my research. So if someone can describe it in simple language it would be very helpful)</p>
","<p>A haplotype is commonly defined as </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...a group of genes within an organism that was inherited together from a single parent. -- <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/haplotype-haplotypes-142"">Nature Scitable</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definition of haplotype applies whether it is just a few genes or all of the genes on an entire chromosome$^1$. In the case of the major histocompatibility complex, it is a group of <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27156/"">more than 200 genes on chromosome 6</a> (Janeway et al. 2001). The set of alleles$^1$ inherited together from one parent form the MHC haplotype. Thus, one offspring will inherit two different MHC haplotypes, one from each parent. The different haplotypes with so many genes helps keep genetic variation in the overall complex, which improves the immune response ability of the organism.  </p>

<p>The term is derived from <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/haploid-309"">haploid</a>, which means half of the normal set of chromosomes. Humans for example are <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/diploid-310"">diploid</a>, meaning it has two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from the mother (maternal) and one inherited from the father (paternal). So, when you inherit just one half of the crhomosome pair, you are inheriting a haplotype.</p>

<p>For general reference, it's important to note that haplotype was not always used to reference a group of two or more genes inherited together. It was commonly used to as a term to represent a sequence of nucleotides together on the same chromosome, even if only part of a single gene. For example, <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/92/9/3731.full.pdf"">Bowen et al. (1995)</a> used mitochondrial haplotypes to study the migration of loggerhead turtles across the Pacific Ocean. They used 350 nucleotides of the <a href=""http://www.geneticorigins.org/mito/mitoframeset.htm"">mitochondrial control region</a>. The control region is over 1000 nucleotides in size but Bowen and colleagues only used 350 nucleotides from part of the control region.  This use was very common in the 1990s and early 2000s before it became easier and less expensive to sequence entire genomes, or at least many genes.</p>

"Can vitamin B17 cure cancer?","5197","","<p>I have heard that a 'vitamin B17' can cure cancer, but that the medical industry never talks about it, since making it legal would cause them loss of billions. But I have never found a reliable report on whether B17 really works or not. There is a question on 'vitamin B17' deficiency as a cause of cancer (see <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/55517/is-cancer-a-nutritional-vitamin-b17-deficiency"">this post</a>), however, not on 'vitamin B17' as a possible medication for cancer. What are the proposed mechanisms? And is there evidence that 'vitamin B17' really works in curing cancer?</p>
","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin"" rel=""noreferrer"">Laetrile/Amygdalin</a> has been claimed to be a suitable treatment for 'cancer' (which is a summary term for an extremely heterogeneous class of diseases). Even though laetrile/amygdalin in these claims is often called a vitamin, it <strong>in fact is not a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"" rel=""noreferrer"">vitamin</a> as the molecule is not essential for the metabolism (<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0142(19800215)45:4%3C799::AID-CNCR2820450432%3E3.0.CO;2-6/abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">Greenberg (1980)</a>)</strong>. </p>

<p>The claimed effects of laetrile/amygdalin are not only based on supplementing the molecule to balance a putative deficiency (with the false assumption that it is in fact necessary), though. Both other putative mechanisms are <strong>based on reactions that form HCN/cyanide</strong>: the enzyme $\beta$-Glucosidase breaks down laetrile/amygdalin and this reaction releases HCN. The argument now is that tumour cells have higher levels of $\beta$-Glucosidase which leads to accumulation of cyanide in tumour cells - with the effect of killing the tumour cells selectively. This would be great... if healthy and tumour cells actually had different levels of the enzyme. Unfortunately, they <strong>seem to have similarly low levels of $\beta$-Glucosidase</strong> (Greenberg (1980)). Even more problematic, Greenberg (1980) also reports elevated levels of $\beta$-Glucosidase in the liver and small intestine ... and you would not really want to release cyanide there. </p>

<p>There is a second mechanism, though: The enzyme $\beta$-Glucuronidase is claimed to be at higher levels in cancer tissue than in healthy tissues (leading to the same desirable effect described above). But again, there <strong>does not seem to be a difference in enzyme levels between healthy and cancer tissues</strong> (<a href=""http://annals.org/aim/article/692293/current-status-laetrile"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dorr and Paxinos (1977)</a>), and even more: <strong>$\beta$-Glucuronidase does not even break down the molecule as laetrile/amygdalin has a glucoside bond</strong> - so there is not even any cyanide release in that case (<a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15563658408992565"" rel=""noreferrer"">Holzbecher et al. (1984)</a>).</p>

<p>Additionally, there is <strong>no clinical evidence that laetrile/amygdalin is an appropriate treatment for any form of cancer</strong>. This topic has been reviewed substantially (see <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00520-006-0168-9"" rel=""noreferrer"">Milazzo et al. (2006)</a> for a review and this fairly recent <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005476.pub4/full"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cochrane review by Milazzo and Horneber (2015)</a>) and <strong>none of the studies included and analysed indicate any positive effect of laetrile/amygdalin</strong>. On the contrary, the <em>in vivo</em> cyanide formation after laetrile/amygdalin uptake <strong>makes the treatment very dangerous as it can lead to cyanide poisoning</strong> (and death, eventually) - especially after oral uptake due to higher $\beta$-Glucosidase concentrations in the digestive system. The authors of the Cochrane review therefore conclude that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The claims that laetrile or amygdalin have beneficial effects for cancer patients are not currently supported by sound clinical data. There is a considerable risk of serious adverse effects from cyanide poisoning after laetrile or amygdalin, especially after oral ingestion. The risk–benefit balance of laetrile or amygdalin as a treatment for cancer is therefore unambiguously negative.</p>

"How does paracetamol interfere with immune system?","5196","","<p>Paracetamol is used to reduce body temperature when it is to high. The high body temperature (fever) is known to be an indication that immune system fights against an infection.</p>

<p>In this context I have two related questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is high body temperature one of the mechanisms of immune system to suppress an infection or it is just a side effect?</li>
<li>If it is just a side effect, does paracetamol remove it by decreasing the intensity with which immune system fights with an infection or not?</li>
</ol>
","<p>First question: Yes. The immune system releases pyrogenic cytokines such as IL-1. Bacteria aren't typically used to 37C, they prefer working at under that temperature to function in the environment. Our body however can take a few degrees here or there however this severely compromises the bacterial enzyme activity. The same is true for other pathogen enzymes. The body also increases copper concentrations in the blood for similar reasons. Problem is of course if the body goes into overdrive and raises our temperature too much, this compromises our own ability to fight the infection so in that case antipyretics like paracetamol can reduce fever. </p>

<p>Second question. It isn't a side effect, however paracetamol works by blocking things like IL-1 that raise temperature. How IL-1 raises your temperature is quite interesting, it tells the hypothalamus (our thermostat) that it should be set higher. So we feel cold (so we try to keep ourselves warm) and the body thinks it's cold (so it increases the temperature by burning glucose mainly)</p>

","<p>Actually we not only consider that all human beings belong to the same species (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) but even that we belong to the same subspecies (<em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>). So, does it really makes sense?</p>

<p><strong>Concept of species</strong></p>

<p>First, please note that the concept of species is more arbitrary than most layman would think. I wrote my opinion about the concept of species in <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39664/how-could-humans-have-interbred-with-neanderthals-if-were-a-different-species"">this post</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Concept of species in sexually reproducing lineages</strong></p>

<p>In sexual lineages, the existence of different species is generally defined by the existence of a reproductive barrier (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_isolation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reproductive isolation</a> and see <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/side_0_0/biospecies_01"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UnderstandingEvolution > biological species concept</a>). </p>

<p>A reproductive barrier can caused by either <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_isolation#Pre-zygotic_isolation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pre-zygotic</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_isolation#Post-zygotic_isolation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">post-zygotic</a> isolation. I will mainly disregard potential case of pre-zygotic reproductive isolation in this answer because such isolation depends highly on the culture and not only on human genetics.</p>

<p>Reproductive isolation might be partial typically leading to cases of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreeding_depression"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">outbreeding depression</a> (when it comes to post/zygotic isolation). </p>

<p>If we had many documented cases of outbreeding depression, it would suggest that we should reconsider the decision of considering all human being. So the question is really: Do we have documented cases of outbreeding depression?</p>

<p><strong>Do we have documented cases of outbreeding depression?</strong></p>

<p>Many cases of inbreeding depression have been documented in humans (<a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002655"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">McQuillan et al. 2012</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1319/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Strauss et al. 2013</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12837695"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lettic et al. 2008</a>, <a href=""http://www.neurology.org/content/40/3_Part_1/495.short"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gellera et al. 1990</a>) but cases of outbreeding depression seem much rarer if any!</p>

<p>I spent some time screening through the literature searching for potential evidence of outbreeding depression. The only paper I found is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448064/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Udry et al. 2003</a>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448064/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Udry et al. 2003</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, note that they do not place their results in the context of our present discussion and do not talk about outbreeding depression.</p></li>
<li><p>They report that children of ""mixed-race"" in US colleges report having more behavioural troubles. One would obviously note that there could well be true that ""mixed-race"" children experience a different environment (incl. social environment) than ""non-mixed-race"" children. Such results therefore does not suggest the existence of any outbreeding depression.</p></li>
<li><p>They also reports more skin problem in mixed-race children. Unfortunately, 1) their p.value is only slightly significant and 2) they track tens of variables without correcting for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">multiple comparisons</a> and only one came out significant causing the expected false positive rate to be higher than the observed positive rates (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">false positive</a> and related concept in statistics).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, in short: <strong>No, there is little to no evidence of outbreeding depression in humans</strong></p>

<p><strong>Potential publication bias and taboo</strong></p>

<p>It is not impossible that there is a publication bias in which researchers looked for inbreeding depression more than for outbreeding depression. One would note also that it would probably be quite taboo to attempt to suggest that there are several species of humans for social reasons and such taboo could cause a publication bias too.</p>

<p>I personally doubt it would be the case that such publication bias exist. Note also that if the evidence of outbreeding depression were obvious and common than we would not have a problem telling that there are several species of humans. In essence, if there is a publication bias that is causing us to fail to see existing outbreeding depression, it must mean that existing outbreeding depression would be relatively rare and with small effect anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Other definitions of species and taboo</strong></p>

<p>Well, the issue is that there is no other commonly accepted definition of species. I don't doubt that for social reasons, we tend to be quite happy that our only definition of species support the idea that all humans belong to the same species. </p>

<p>It is hard (for me at least) to tell whether we might tend to be more permissive in other lineages and naming two sister lineages as belonging to different species.</p>

<p><strong>Why same subspecies and not only species?</strong></p>

<p>Under the biological species concept, <em>H. sapiens</em> and <em>H. neanderthalis</em> should belong to the same species. This is why we now rather call them <em>H. sapiens sapiens</em> and <em>H. sapien neanderthalis</em>. I suppose it would feel painful to many to not highlight our differences with <em>H. neanderthalis</em> and so, we decided to discriminate.</p>

<p>Again, it is hard (for me at least) to appreciate how this subspecies discrimnation in the <em>Homo</em> lineage compares to discrimination among potential subspecies in other lineages.</p>

<p>Take a human for instance, make a line from the top of our head right down the middle. However, internally it is not the same. Our organs <em>excluding</em> the kidneys, lungs, reproductive organs, etc are not symmetrically placed in our body.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do we not have an even number of each organ so it can be placed symmetrically?</li>
<li>If we have a single organ why is it not placed in the middle like the brain or bladder is for instance?</li>
<li>Is there some evolutionary advantage that led to this setup?</li>
</ul>
","<p>First, I think it worthwhile considering 'Why would internal symmetry be beneficial?' Developmental simplicity jumps to mind immediately. You can also consider relationship to external organs; the stomach and esophagus are lined up with the mouth which is symmetrical about the sagittal plane. Or maybe even balance; the lungs are large organs and if put to one side would likely cause locomotive issues. (Perhaps this is even an interesting topic for another question.)</p>

<p>That said, I feel, at it's core the evolutionary advantage which led to the lack of ubiquitous internal symmetry is <strong>space</strong>. Simply put, there is only so much room inside an organism and every little counts. Thus, if there isn't a need for a particular organ to be mirrored about a plane then there <em>is</em> a benefit in putting elsewhere: utilization of space.</p>

<p>I think a fantastic example of this is the human digestive tract. The key factor in the shape of the intestines is utilization of space, which directly affects the point at which is connects to the stomach, itself contributing to the asymmetrical shape of the stomach. One could envision other configurations, sure, and nature has. However, this configuration works quite well and the extraordinary use of limited space seems to outweigh all benefits of symmetry.</p>

<p>To directly respond to your questions above:</p>

<strong>Response:</strong> Each organ addresses (or addressed) a need of the organism. Addressing that need with multiple organs working in concert has benefits and consequences, as does addressing the need with a single organ alone. These benefits and consequences are balanced throughout the evolution of an organism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> If we have a single organ why is it not placed in the middle like the brain or bladder is for instance?
<strong>Response:</strong> <em>I feel</em> space. Again, there are benefits to symmetry but there are many other factors at play. Some of which, it seems, are more important than symmetry at times.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there some evolutionary advantage that led to this setup?

<p>In thinking through this question I found myself able to rationalize why internal symmetry isn't necessary. However, I'd be interested in seeing opinions on why, then, external symmetry is so prevalent.</p>

"Can cell exist without Ribosomes?","5166","","<p>Last night I came across a question that goes as follows:-</p>

<p>Cells cannot exist without
a) cell wall
b) cell membrane
c) mitochondria
d) ribosomes</p>

<p>I am getting confused with option B and option D</p>

<hr>

<p>If RBC is lacking ribosomes then where the antigen proteins on RBC are coming from ?</p>
","<p>The most essential thing for a cell to survive is a membrane. Without a membrane there is no boundary between cell and its surroundings. A selectively permeable membrane is needed for cells (from single celled organisms to elephants and giraffes and whales) to survive. Cells will die quickly on removal of cell membrane.</p>

<p>The RBCs are good example of cells without mitochondria or ribosomes which survive for 120 days.</p>

<hr>

<p>Please read the article on <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoiesis"" rel=""nofollow"">Erythropoiesis</a> for detailed information on how RBCs form and how they have proteins in their surface.</p>

<p>In short, the RBCs acquire the surface proteins during their formation period in the bone marrow. Inside the bone marrow the premature RBCs have nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria, etc... and produce all the required structural and functional proteins. On maturing they loose the nucleus and cell organelles and contain only hemoglobin in their cytoplasm.</p>

"What is the evidence that australopithecines were bipedal?","5165","","<p>Before the discovery of <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> in the 1970s, most anthropologists believed that an increase in brain capacity had preceded bipedal locomotion. However, this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aLucy_Skeleton.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">reconstruction of the Lucy skeleton</a> shows that the <em>A. afarensis</em> was bipedal even with a brain size of around 400 cc.</p>

<p>But the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aLucy_blackbg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">actual Lucy skeleton</a> does not include feet, and only has two partial leg bones.</p>

<p>How do anthropologists determine, based on the bones preserved, that <em>A. afarensis</em> was bipedal?</p>
","<p>Mainly because of the characteristics of the pelvic joint with the femur and the foramen magnum (the hole the spinal cord uses to connect with the encephalon). Also, there are more specimens other than Lucy, and there also exist fossil footprints (for instance the Laetoli footprints). All this evidence points to a bipedal walking.</p>

<p>In this image you can see the position of the foramen magnum in a typical pure quadrupedal mammalian, such as a dog. The foramen inserts in the posterior part of the cranium. In the human, the foramen inserts in the base of the skull, due to de erected position. In chimpanzees, which have quadrupedal march, but can also display some bipedal movements, the foramen is slightly displaced towards the basis of the cranium, in an intermediate position between both.</p>

"Why Do Ruminants Require A Multi-Compartment Stomach To Digest Food?","5157","","<p>Cows, camels, sheep, goats, etc being ruminants must chew their food repeatedly by regurgitating their food from their first stomach compartment and chewing their 'cud'. This then finer chewed material makes its way to the various stomach compartments to be digested.</p>

<p>These animals are eating plant material, the same plant material animals such as elephants, horses and hippos eat as well. However, these animals only have one stomach compartment. </p>

<ul>
<li>Why does one need a multi-compartment stomach and one does not if they are all eating the same/similar food?</li>
</ul>
","<p>There is more difference than just the parts of plants that are eaten.</p>

<p>Two of their stomachs - rumen and reticulum are not used for digesting food at all. Multiple rounds of chewing and mixing with saliva, wich result in very small particles of undigested food help the bacteria in those stomachs reach, digest and use that cellulose-rich plant material. Cows ""eat"" the bacteria from their stomachs and the grass is just food for these bacteria. You could say that cows are not herbivores but secondary consumers.</p>

<p>Look at this picture (from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on ruminants</a>, a good place to check all this in more detail but still simpler than most professional books):

<p>See that the ruminants have the same second and third part of their digestive system (though the bacteria use up most of carbohydrates, so some difference in absorbed material), but have an additional part in the front - where the microbes digest and ferment the food, that the ruminant has provived them. The reticulorumen needs to be large in order to provide space for all that plant material and bacteria. </p>

"Why does max heart rate decrease with age?","5155","","<p>I have heard that max heart rate declines steadily with age, and can be approximated by the equation Max Rate = 220 - Age.  </p>

<p>What is the physiological reason for this decline, and how is it consistent with the fact that most endurance athletes reach their peak cardiovascular performance at around age 30?</p>
","<p>There are many reasons why the maximal heart rate decreases with age. 
The most prevalent is the heterogenous thickening of the walls of the heart.
Cardiac output is stroke volume times heart rate.</p>

<p>When the wall thickens, the heart needs more energy to achieve the same pumping (bigger stroke volume) or it needs to increase heart rate at rest. 
Because of physical limitation, the stroke volume cannot be increased. 
Heart needs to also rest which it does before the action potential reaches the AV conduction system. 
Note the long time just after the action potential reaches AV node. </p>

<p>However, the heart cannot increase its maximal heart rate if the elasticity of the walls have decreased in ageing. 
Ageing often leads to heterogenous thickening of walls of the heart. 
If this is the case, then T wave gets high fast; which causes the risk of bleeding when exercising. 
Doing sport or just feeling tired can cause a long-standing pain in the heart area in the chest. </p>

<p>Sport then again leads to dynamic hypertrophy of the heart tissue, which increases the maximal heart rate. 
Ageing then again does not have such a dynamic changes.</p>

<p>There are secondary reasons caused by ageing</p>

<ul>
<li>hormonal changes</li>
<li>decreased metabolism</li>
<li>decreased physical activity </li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>which are associated with decreased maximal heart rate.</p>

<p><strong>Why most endurance athletes reach their peak cardiovascular performance at around age 30?</strong></p>

<p>Human's best age is at about 25 years old physiologically. 
Muscles grow in rest. 
When practicing at that age, recovery time of muscles is short. 
It takes long time to improve cardiovascular performance (1-5 years), since heart muscle improves slowly. 
I think the slow hypertrophy of heart musculature and the best physiological age of human are the reasons why the most successful endurance athletes are about 28-30 years old.</p>

"Is cancer caused by vitamin B17 deficiency?","5127","","<p>I have read in an article on the internet that cancer is caused due to deficiency of vitamin B17 which has been removed from our diets long ago in the western food. But some people say that vitamin B17 does not work. So, is it deficiency of vitamin B17 which causes cancer i.e. can this vitamin really be used to cure cancer?</p>
","<p><strong>Short Answer:</strong> No.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> First of all, there is no such thing as vitamin B17. The compound, amygdalin or laetrile, which is referred to by this term, is not a vitamin<sup><a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.3322%2Fcanjclin.31.2.91"" rel=""noreferrer"">1</a></sup>. Amygdalin is indeed a cyanogenic glycoside (like glucosinolates, see <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/57011/what-causes-bitter-taste-of-some-vegetables"">this</a> answer) which is poisonous to organisms including humans, because it forms cyanide which is toxic<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin"" rel=""noreferrer"">2</a></sup>. See this image for its structure:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bgswM.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bgswM.png"" alt=""amygdalin""></a></p>

<p>The notion that amygdalin is a vitamin started when Ernest Krebs Jr., inventor of 'laetrile' (a modified form of amygdalin), rebranded it as a vitamin to get around the new FDA drug regulations and get it approved as nutrient supplement instead of pharmaceutical<sup><a href=""https://www.cancertreatmentwatch.org/q/laetrile/commissioner.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">3</a></sup>. Ernest Krebs Sr., in 1920s, formulated a theory that amygdalin could kill cancer cells<sup><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0007-9235&amp;date=1991&amp;volume=41&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=187"" rel=""noreferrer"">4</a></sup> and the notion was carried forward by his son, though Ernest Krebs Sr. himself considered amygdalin as too toxic for human consumption. This view received a huge uplift when, in 1973, a public relations officer at Sloan Kettering Hospital, which was given the task by the NIH of performing a series of laetrile trials, alleged a cover up of, and leaked, data that claimed potential for laetrile as an anti-cancer agent<sup><a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/198/4323/1231"" rel=""noreferrer"">5</a></sup>, though nobody else was able to reproduce the same test results in a series of followups. Yet, perhaps the most prominent force which still keeps this myth alive is the book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1943499039"" rel=""noreferrer"">World Without Cancer: The Story of Vitamin B17</a> by G. E. Griffith (interestingly, reviewed by 'Dr.' Ernest Krebs Jr.). According to all these reports, laetrile might work in following ways<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0032851/#CDR0000062976__37"" rel=""noreferrer"">6</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>malignant cells have higher levels of $\beta$-glucuronidase and lesser levels of rhodanase, because of which they are more susceptible to effects of laetrile.</p></li>
<li><p>malignant cells have higher levels of $\beta$-glucosidase (different from $\beta$-glucuronidase) and lesser levels of rhodanase, because of which they are more susceptible to effects of laetrile.</p></li>
<li><p>cancer is due to deficiency of vitamin B17 (laetrile) and vitamin B17 is required by cells to restore health (though there is no evidence for this).</p></li>
<li><p>cyanide released by laetrile has a toxic effect beyond its interference with oxygen utilization by cells. According to this theory, cyanide increases the acid content of tumors and leads to the destruction of lysosomes. The injured lysosomes release their contents, thereby killing the cancer cells and arresting tumor growth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Laetrile is even supposed to raise the red count in blood, be of value in treating sickle cell anemia, treat parasitic diseases, help regulate intestinal flora, cause lowering of blood pressure in cancer victims and provide relief from arthritis<sup><a href=""https://www.cancertreatmentwatch.org/q/laetrile/commissioner.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>However, all clinical tests have concluded that laetrile is poisonous to humans (and other organisms) due to cyanide poisoning and thus, its effect in cancer treatment is unambiguously negative<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0032851/#CDR0000062976__37"" rel=""noreferrer"">6</a>,<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005476.pub4/full"" rel=""noreferrer"">7</a>,<a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2F14651858.CD005476.pub3"" rel=""noreferrer"">8</a></sup>. In fact, use of laetrile has even led to a number of deaths<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-89043-014-4"" rel=""noreferrer"">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In reality, when amygdalin is ingested, the enzymes  $\beta$-glucosidase, emulsin and amygdalase hydrolyze it into gentiobiose and L-mandelonitrile. Gentiobiose is further hydrolyzed to glucose, whereas L-mandelonitrile is converted into benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, which causes cyanide poisoning<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin"" rel=""noreferrer"">2</a></sup>. The concerned process looks like<sup><a href=""http://dentomed.u-toyama.ac.jp/en/metabolism_information_on_chemical_compounds/ME000034/"" rel=""noreferrer"">10</a></sup>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ex0Yo.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ex0Yo.png"" alt=""amygdalin metabolism""></a></p>

<p>If the quantity of cyanide generated is under the acceptable daily intake limit (0.05 mg/kg body weight)<sup><a href=""http://www.inchem.org/documents/jmpr/jmpmono/v65apr09.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">11</a></sup>, then it can be handled easily by enzymes, like rhodanase which converts toxic CN<sup>-</sup> to non-toxic SCN<sup>-</sup> ion<sup><a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1159%2F000121331"" rel=""noreferrer"">12</a></sup>. But this quantity is often beyond the limit; a single apricot seed contains about 0.5 mg cyanide<sup><a href=""http://ispub.com/IJH/9/2/10959"" rel=""noreferrer"">13</a></sup>. Hence, it results in cyanide poisoning.</p>

<p>Thus, <strong>the so-called vitamin B17 cannot cure cancer</strong>.</p>

<p>We know that the 'hot' feeling of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper"" rel=""noreferrer"">chilli peppers</a> is caused by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin"" rel=""noreferrer"">Capsaicin</a>.

<p>There appears to be <a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/whats-so-hot-about-chili-peppers-116907465/"" rel=""noreferrer"">some question</a> about the cause of the 'spicy' taste of chilli peppers. </p>

<p>My question is: <strong>What is the reason that chilli peppers don't taste as hot in space?</strong></p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>All food taste bland in space, not only chilli. </p>

<hr>

<p>The claim in that tweet (<em>""Chili peppers don’t taste as hot in space as they do on Earth""</em>) is not exactly correct because, the way it's worded, it gives the impression that only chilli peppers have a different taste. In fact, astronauts/cosmonauts use more chili and other spices than they regularly do on Earth, for a reason: they say that food in space (microgravity) taste bland. <strong>All</strong> food, not only chili. </p>

<p>Since the beginning of space flight, astronauts report that food taste different in microgravity. According to the Scientific American article <em>When It Comes to Living in Space, It's a Matter of Taste</em> (Romanoff and Romanoff, 2017):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many said that flavors are dulled and they crave fare that is spicier and considerably more tart than they would prefer on Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, due to the food tasting so bland, astronauts in fact use more chili and other spices than they normally do on Earth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's possible that hot sauce and salsa could be key ingredients to the success of a manned mission to Mars. The kicked-up condiments already came close to causing a mutiny on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2002 when astronaut Peggy Whitson threatened to bar entry to the crew of the visiting shuttle Atlantis unless they came bearing a promised resupply of the spicy stuff. Only when shuttle commander Jeff Ashby announced that he had the goods did Whitson say, ""Okay, we'll let you in then."" Whitson was joking, but the need for astronauts to be able to  spice up their food while in orbit is no laughing matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it's still unknown why food taste bland in microgravity. Also, there is no consensus about that fact, to start with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There's little scientific data to back up astronauts' claims that taste changes in space, despite a number of studies since the 1970s on the effect of microgravity on the sense of taste and smell. In essence [...] study participants were split on the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those that report a change in the taste, some hypothesis were proposed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most prominent physiological changes associated with spaceflight has to do with fluid shifting from the lower to the upper parts of the body because of weightlessness. This facial and upper-body swelling also creates significant nasal congestion, and because odor is essential to the sense of taste, a decrease in the perception of flavors would occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there is little scientific evidence supporting this <em>fluid-shifting</em> hypothesis. According to Vickers et al. (2001), reproducing that fluid-shift in a simulated microgravity, where people had a head-down bed rest, has no effect on the threshold sensitivity of tastants. The same lack of changes in the taste and smell sensitivity under simulated microgravity was found by Olabi et al. (2002).   </p>

<p>Despite that, this fluid-shifting hypothesis is supported by NASA (Nasa.gov, 2017) in an educational resource for kids:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the early 1960s, astronauts found that their taste buds did not seem to be as effective when they were in space. Why does this happen in space? This is because fluids in the body get affected by the reduced gravity conditions (also called fluid shift). On Earth, gravity acts on the fluid in our bodies and pulls it into our legs. In space, this fluid is distributed equally in the body. This change can be seen in the first few days of arriving in space when astronauts have a puffy face as fluid blocks the nasal passages. The puffy face feels like a heavy cold and this can cause taste to be affected in the short term by reducing their ability to smell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same source says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When food seems to lose its flavor, astronauts usually ask for condiments, such as <strong>hot sauces, to give food some intensity of taste</strong>. A variety of condiments are available for the crewmembers to add  to their food such as honey, and sauces like soy sauce, BBQ, and taco. (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>For reasons yet unknown, it seems that <strong>all</strong> food (not only chilli peppers) taste bland in microgravity. To cope with that, astronauts rely on chili and other hot spices. </p>

"Is nicotine toxic to humans?","5106","","<p>More specifically, is nicotine in the concentrations that smokers receive when smoking cigarettes toxic? I know that in great enough concentrations it can be toxic (but then, so can just about anything else, including oxygen) and I know that in plants it is used as a defense against insects and can even be used as an insecticide. However, it has always been my understanding that nicotine is irrelevant as far as the harmful effects of smoking go. </p>

<p>I recently had a conversation with another biologist who had just quit smoking and had done quite a bit of research on the subject. He said that nicotine itself is in fact bad for you and, therefore, that tobacco-less alternatives to cigarettes (such as electronic cigarettes) are still harmful <strong>because of the nicotine alone</strong>. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any more information on this? Perhaps some references? Or, even better, a detailed explanation of the pathways involved? Again, I stress, not about nicotine's toxicity in general but about its harmful effects on vertebrates (preferably human) at the kinds of concentrations one could expect to ingest when smoking.</p>
","<p>I think its useful to say that nicotine is not very toxic to humans - cells don't die or get sick for typical smoking habits.  Secondary health effects are possible, but here is a toxicological profiles. </p>

<p>Nicotine is a toxin in large enough quantities and nicotine has an LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of individuals) of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_poisoning#Toxicology"">0.5-1 mg Nicotine / kg of body weight</a>.  So even a small spill on your skin of the chemical can be life threatening, but for smokers the nicotine itself is not dangerous. </p>

<p>Individuals who smoke intake about 1 mg per cigarette smoked.  So a small adult (110 lbs) can smoke 25 cigarettes in a short period of time (or all at once!) and just barely get to the bottom end of that limit.  Nicotine is water soluble and clears out through the urine at a fast rate though - half of the nicotine from a cigarette is cleared from  your system within 2 hours, which means that 4-5 pack a day smokers are not really killing themselves (from nicotine).  </p>

<p>That being said, children are about 5-10 times more sensitive than adults, so even 5-6 cigarettes in an hour can be toxic.  That's quite a bit of smoking though. </p>

<p>Not all animals have the same relationship to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as humans do.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide#Neonicotinoids"">Nicotine is toxic to insects and will kill an insect in a matter of minutes or hours</a>. Rats are about 50x less sensitive than people.  </p>

<p>I think its comparable to the question of whether caffeine is harmful to people.  In the amount we consume it, sometimes up to grams a day, there is no obvious common side effect, but you figure that decades later it will show up as a problem - a difficult connection to prove.</p>

"What is Mendelian Randomization, and how is it used to infer causality in epidemiology?","5034","","<p>Studies of human traits and diseases are inherently confined to observational studies, known as epidemiological studies. This can make it very hard to determine what actually causes a particular disease or trait, and what is just a by-product or biomarker of the disease.</p>

<p><strong>Mendelian randomization</strong> is a statistical technique used by genetic epidemiologists to determine <em>causal</em> effects, for instance whether a biomarker actually influences disease risk, or whether it is just a statistical association.</p>

<p>From basics, how can genetics be used to determine causal associations between traits (such as blood markers) and increased risk of disease, and on what assumptions is this based?</p>
","<p>Epidemiological studies analyze human observational cohort data to try to statistically link disease risk and biomarkers. For instance, it is know a well know fact that smoking increases the risk of lung cancer, yet before the 1950s it was widely considered otherwise until observational evidence proved irrefutable (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.1950.02920090056026"" rel=""noreferrer"">Levin, 1950</a>).</p>

<h2>Confounding</h2>

<p>However, inferring causality using observational data can be tricky. For instance, there is a very strong statistical association between ice-cream sales and risk of drowning in the UK. In this example it is quite clear that the association is <em>confounded</em> - that is, there is a 'hidden' variable we have not accounted for that links the 2. It is easy to infer that ice-cream sales don't increase your risk of drowning, but the 2 are correlated because both ice-cream sales and risk of drowning increase at the same time of year; both are positively correlated with 'nice weather' traits.</p>

<p>In the above example it is easy to say that the relationship is confounded. However, in a hypothetical study on type-2 diabetes that finds higher blood hematocrit (% volume of blood made up of red blood cells) is associated with increased odds of being diabetic, it is less clear whether higher hematocrit increases susceptibility/risk of becoming diabetic, or whether diabetes increases hematocrit. Longitudinal studies that follow the same individuals for many years help determine <em>which came first</em> - this is based on the assumption that if raised hematocrit is associated with increased risk of diabetes 5 years later, it is more likely that hematocrit is <em>causal</em>, and you have a biomarker for diabetes risk (although you still cannot say it is causal, it may just be a proxy for another 'hidden' trait, or the effect may be <em>mediated</em> by another unmeasured marker).</p>

<h2>Causality</h2>

<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have become increasingly popular since the completion of the human genome project, and there are currently (15th August 2012) 7039 genetic variants (SNPs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms) documented in the catalogue of published GWA studies (<a href=""http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/"" rel=""noreferrer"">www.genome.gov/gwastudies</a>). These SNPs have been robustly associated with traits such as 'risk of type-2 diabetes', or 'blood adiponectin levels', by large genetic epidemiological studies, usually with many thousands of participants sampled. </p>

<p>The key point about SNP associations is that the direction of effect is always known; a particular SNP may affect your adiponectin levels, but adiponectin does not affect the SNPs you inherit.</p>

<h2>Mendelian Randomization</h2>

<p>In an observational study that finds an association between (for example) circulating triglyceride levels and type-2 diabetes (using fasting glucose and insulin as 'proxies') it is not possible to determine the causal direction; do triglycerides increase risk of diabetes or vice versa? (This is an actual case study by <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db10-1317"" rel=""noreferrer"">De Silva, <em>et al</em>. 2011</a>).</p>

<p>Using the assumption that the inheritance of SNPs is essentially random (i.e. not affected by the trait you are measuring - in this example triglycerides) it is possible to determine the causal effect of triglycerides on the risk of diabetes. Note: this is only possible for traits (such as serum triglyceride levels) that have SNPs identified by GWA studies.</p>

<p>First of all, you have already calculated the association between triglyceride levels (in this study a 1 standard-deviation (SD) increase in triglycerides was associated, with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 2.68, with type-2 diabetes in almost 10,000 human participants). Because it is a cross-sectional study, only an association is reported, with no causal implications... yet!</p>

<h3>Enter the SNPs</h3>

<p>Having identified the SNPs that increase triglyceride levels (at the time of the study, 10 were reported in the literature), each participants genotype for these SNPs needs to be measured or inferred (generally this is performed in large cohort studies, which are then used for many different individual projects).</p>

<p>A combined 'score' is then derived for each individual. This is conceptually very simple; if an individual has 4 of the 10 triglyceride raising alleles, they are given a score or 4, and so on. This is complicated by the fact that the SNPs have different effects on the triglycerides, so a 'weighted allele score' is derived instead (simply put, the coefficient of the SNP~triglyceride association is taken into account when adding risk allele scores). By using this kind of score, a 'per allele' estimation of the effects can be estimated;</p>

<p>The association between the triglyceride levels and the allele score is then determined (by linear regression analysis - adjusted for age and sex, as these are known to affect triglycerides). There are actually 2 ways of performing the next analysis, the first of which is conceptually simpler, but the second of which is more robust.</p>

<h3>Method 1: the 'triangulation' approach</h3>

<p>The two observed associations calculated so far (per-SD trig. levels are associated with diabetes, and the per-allele SNP score are associated with per-SD trig. levels) can then be used to calculate an <em>expected</em> association. This is simply derived by multiplying the 2 coefficients together. Below is the 'triangulation' representation of this;</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ItJ0.png"" alt=""Triangulation approach for Mendelian Randomization""></p>

<p>This <em>expected</em> association between the triglyceride-raising SNPs and risk of diabetes is only true if raised triglycerides increase the risk of diabetes. The <em>observed</em> association between the SNP-score and diabetes can then be calculated. If the expected and observed estimates are similar, then triglycerides raise diabetes risk, and are a causal biomarker. If the observed association is null (or, at least, much smaller), then triglycerides are likely to be secondary.</p>

<h3>Method 2: the instrumental variable analysis</h3>

<p>This method is for the more hardy statisticians. Instrumental variables are derived variables, and represent an intermediate between a proposed 'cause' and the 'effect', or outcome (in this case the triglyceride raising alleles are proposed to 'cause' diabetes, and this is mediated by the triglyceride levels themselves).</p>

<p>Using a linear regression, the ""fitted values"" from a model with triglyceride levels as the outcome, and the weighted SNP score as the only independent variable, are extracted. These fitted values represent the variance in the triglycerides that is predicted by the SNP score. We are using the SNPs as the <em>instrument</em> here, as they directly influence the biomarker (exposure, i.e. triglycerides), and are not affected by either the exposure or the outcome (diabetes). <strong>The important assumption here is that the effect of the SNPs on the outcome is not confounded, and can only be mediated by the exposure - this is true for genotypes (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sim.3034"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lawlor, <em>et al</em>. 2008</a>)</strong>.</p>

<p>By then determining the association between the derived variable and diabetes, you will know whether the proportion of the triglyceride variance predicted by the SNPs is associated with diabetes - if so, then triglycerides increase the risk of diabetes.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The study performed both types of Mendelian Randomization analysis and found no evidence to suggest a causal association between triglycerides and diabetes phenotypes.</p>

<p>So Mendelian Randomization is a useful tool for inferring causality with biomarkers. It is not necessarily conclusive evidence, but it can help distinguish biomarkers of particular importance and interest (with regard to interventions) from those that are just markers of the disease.</p>

"Circulation through the liver in light of drug metabolism","5022","","<p>I have a lingering question which stems from an answer that I gave to <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/982/what-hydrolyses-aspirin-within-the-digestive-tract-and-blood-stream/993#993"">What hydrolyses aspirin within the digestive tract and blood stream?</a></p>

<p>When a drug or any other substance is absorbed into the bloodstream in the stomach or small intestine, it ultimately passes through the hepatic portal vein and into the liver sinusoids, where it is processed by hepatocytes and introduced into the general circulation via the vena cava.  In terms of metabolism, this is what causes a ""first-pass"" effect for drugs that are ingested.</p>

<p>For drugs that are delivered either by intravenous, intramuscular, or sub-lingually (as in the other Biology.SE question), this first-pass effect is avoided, and the drug is introduced into the general circulation without being metabolized by the liver first.</p>

<p>Even though the first pass is avoided, the blood in the body still makes its way back through the liver eventually via the hepatic artery, which is a branch off of the celiac artery.  </p>

<p>The issue I still have is, does the incoming blood from the hepatic artery merge with the blood from the hepatic portal vein?  If not, does the blood from the hepatic artery still interact with the hepatocytes in some way? (it makes sense that it does, and I have also read that one of the main functions of the hepatic artery was to deliver blood supply for the liver's metabolic needs)  If this is not the case, where in the body would these drugs that were introduced via IV, etc., be metabolized? </p>
","<p>Yes, the blood from the hepatic artery (proper) and the portal vein mix in the sinusoids of the liver. The hepatic vein supplies about 75% of the blood to the liver, and the hepatic artery the remaining 25%. Because the portal vein provides such a large part of the blood supply to the liver, then any disease that causes the blood to build up can cause portal hypertension.</p>

<p>The hepatic artery carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart. The portal vein is part of the portal system and connects the capillary beds of the gastrointestinal tract to those of the liver. Because of the larger volume through the portal vein, I think that each vessel carries about half the oxygen supply to the liver.</p>

<p>For drugs introduced through an injection, for example, metabolism occurs throughout the circulatory system and in the liver. Remember that it's all the same blood supply, but the first-pass effect just refers to the blood that goes to the liver before entering the systemic circulation (by which it can travel to its target).</p>

"How does translational coupling work in prokaryotes?","5017","","<p>Today I heard about a phenomenon called ""translational coupling"", where the translation of one protein influences the translation of another protein.

","<p>Translational coupling describes in how some cases an mRNA will code from more than one protein (i.e. will be polycistronic).  Translational coupling is thought to be mostly used as a way to make a set of genes are translated at roughly the same amount in the cell. </p>

<p>Translational coupling is very common in prokaryotes and nearly half of e coli genes are found in a polycistronic operon.  What we know about them is revealing.

"How do trees manage to grow equally in all directions?","5006","","<p>I was walking down a road with these beautifully huge trees when this question occurred to me. </p>

<p>Large trees with many thick branches have to grow equally in all directions, or they would tip over. Is there some sort of mechanism to ensure this uniform growth? Or is it just a happy coincidence arising from uniform availability of sunlight on all sides? If one branch of a tree becomes too heavy due to many sub-branches, does this somehow trigger growth on the opposite side of the tree? </p>

<p>I have seen that potted plants in houses tend to grow towards sunlight. My mum often turns pots around by 180 degrees to ensure that plants don't bend in any one direction. I assume that this is because sunlight increases the rate of photosynthesis, leading to rapid growth of the meristem. 
For trees growing in open spaces, this wouldn't be a problem. But there are many large trees that grow in the shadow of buildings without bending away from the buildings, even though this is the only direction from which they would receive any sunlight. Is there any explanation for this?</p>
","<p>Growth in plants is tightly controlled by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">auxins</a> – plant hormones. Auxin itself usually has an <del>inhibitory</del> effect on growth [EDIT: see comments and Richard’s answer for correction]. As far as I know there is no active control to restore plant symmetry once it has gone awry (but I could be wrong!) but the inhibitory effect of auxin synthesised at the meristem and diffusing in all directions causes a symmetrical pattern of inhibition and activation, forming shoots at symmetrical distances around the shoot apical meristem – this is very visible in the symmetry of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesco_broccoli"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">romanesco broccoli</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Fractal_Broccoli.jpg/320px-Fractal_Broccoli.jpg"" alt=""Romanesco""></p>

<p>Furthermore, there are several mechanisms involving auxin which shape the general growth of the plant. The most important ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apical_dominance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Apical dominance</strong></a> which causes the apex (the stem) of the plant to grow more strongly than other parts of the plant, ensuring a general centring of the growth.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototropism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Phototropism</strong></a> causes the plant to grow towards sunlight.

"Why do we like salt?","5000","","<p>A few friends of mine told me that salt provides zero nutritional value to us, and in fact can harm our bodies. Now, these guys are medical students, and being an engineering student myself, I decided not to argue with them. The rest of this question assumes that this fact is true, so if it's not, you can just go ahead and call me out now...</p>

<p>So here's my understanding of things: we 'like' doing things because of our instincts, which have slowly become refined over millions of years. For example, I 'like' eating foods with fat in it because my instinct compels me to do so. Fat is 'good' for my body, since it provides a lot of energy (obesity problems aside).</p>

<p>So are there certain things, such as eating salt, that are not in fact beneficial in any way, and we only do these things because we were trained to as children? This is the only thing I could come up with, but it's not a very satisfying explanation for a few reasons. First, I think humans have been eating salt for a long time. This would mean that most likely, it is actually our 'instinct' to eat salt. Also, salt is eaten in every culture today, which has the same implication.</p>

<p>So is there some better explanation?</p>
","<p>In developed countries we usually consume enough salt (sodium to be exact) without actually adding table salt to food. Everything can become toxic when consumed in excess - even water - and when we frequently add more salt to foods, we tend to consume sodium in potentially harmful excess. That's what your friends are referring to.</p>

<p>However, salt (sodium) is one of the most essential substances your body needs to stay alive, for several reasons. One of the main purposes of sodium is the upkeep of blood's osmolarity (i.e. concentrations of osmotically active compounds. Higher salt concentration on one side of a permeable membrane attracts water to that side - I'm sure you've heard that before). There are numerous systems in your body to make sure the osmolarity of blood is correct. If they fail and blood becomes hypo or hypertonic, your cells will be sucked dry or pumped full of water and in either case, burst and die.</p>

<p>Look up the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system for example: when the kidney filters blood, it reabsorbs or lets through water depending on the current blood osmolarity; leading to higher or lower amount of higher or lower concentrated urine. You drink lots, your blood is diluted, it becomes less tonic, kidney registers that and lets water through more, you urinate more. There are many more elements involved there, including blood pressure, nerve signals stimulating thirst or hunger of different kinds, some hormones etc.</p>

<p>As you can see, there's a reason why the basic infusion given in hospitals to replace lost blood quickly isn't just water but normal saline.</p>

<p>Delayed update to pick up some side aspects of your description: 1) There are of course things that humans do which have absolutely no value to them whatsoever. Anything that plays into the feel-good-reward-circuit in our brain can become such an unhelpful habit. Take smoking and drug consumption as examples. 2) About evolutionary relevance: Being a key player in maintaining body function, evolution selected for instictively liking salt. Simultaneously, most people will not like food that is extremely salty - a protective mechanism against excess.</p>

"Will the ""frog in boiling water not jumping out"" work on warm blooded animals","4990","","<p>There is the famous saying about a frog that is put in water that are slowly boiling will not jump out until it's too late.

<p>For example, I don't like saunas, when I get in them I have problem breathing and I can't stand the heat, which means that I can be in a sauna for a very short time until I have had enough and get out. Will putting me in a sauna at room temperature and then turning it on to gradually begin to heat until its destination temperature will allow me to fill more comfortable and stay longer inside once it's at the normal sauna temperature?</p>
","<p>This answer belongs on Skeptics. Sorry to disappoint, but the ""boiled frog"" phenomenon is an ""old folk warning"". This essentially negates your original question altogether. Neither a cold-blooded animal (such as a frog) or warm-blooded animal will boil to death under the conditions implied by the warning (i.e. escape is permitted and water is heated very gradually).  </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2011/03/frog-fable-brought-to-boil/"">1897 research by German scientist E. W. Scripture, upon which the fable may have first been based, has been deemed flawed by scientists:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From Scripture's research: “. . . a live frog can actually be boiled without a
  movement if the water is heated slowly enough; in one experiment, the
  temperature was raised at the rate of 0.002 degrees Celsius per
  second, and the frog was found dead at the end of 2.5 hours without
  having moved."" </p>
  
  <p>According to Dr. Karl S. Kruszelnicki (Australian scientist): ""[T]he numbers just don’t seem right. If the water comes to a boil,
  that means a final temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. In that case,
  the frog would have to have been put into the water at 82 degrees
  Celsius. Surely, the frog would have died immediately.""</p>
  
  <p>According to Dr. Victor H. Hutchinson (Herpetologist and Zoology Professor at University of Oklahoma): 
  ""The legend is entirely incorrect! The 'critical thermal maxima' of many species of frogs have been
  determined by several investigators. In this procedure, the water in
  which a frog is submerged is heated gradually at about 2 degrees
  Fahrenheit per minute.  As the temperature of the water is gradually
  increased, the frog will eventually become more and more active in
  attempts to escape the heated water.  If the container size and
  opening allow the frog to jump out, it will do so.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://srel.uga.edu/ecoviews/ecoview071223.htm"">Whit Gibbons (University of Georgia) says that there is an important message behind the false legend:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So where does that leave us with the boiling frog as a metaphor for
  the human response to economic change or environmental degradation?
  Well, it's not true that you can induce a frog to willingly remain in
  boiling water by starting it off in cold water. But that does not
  diminish the truth of the message that the accumulation of
  imperceptible changes can have a significant effect on the economy and
  the environment. We need to be aware of what changes are occurring and
  to respond to them in a timely fashion. The metaphor lies in the
  frog's ability to escape from the container: if there's no way out,
  then the frog's fate is a foregone conclusion.</p>

","<p>Other answers are correct in their own terms, but because of homologous recombination during meiosis, the idea of maternal and paternal chromosomes becomes meaningless.

"Do animals exhibit handedness (paw-ness?) preference?","4968","","<p>I have been observing my cat and found that when confronted with an unknown item, she will always use her front left paw to touch it.</p>

<p>This has me wondering if animals exhibit handedness like humans do? (and do I have a left handed cat?)</p>

<p>One note of importance is that with an unknown item, her approach is always identical, so possibly using the left paw means allowing a fast possible exit based on how she positions her body.</p>

<p>This question is related to <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/160/are-there-dextral-sinistral-higher-animals"">Are there dextral/sinistral higher animals?</a>. However, I question the ""paw-ness"" as a consequence of how the cat is approaching new items (to be ready to flee), whereas the other question remarks about the high number of ""right-pawed"" dogs and questions the influence of people for this preference.</p>
","<h3> Short Answer </h3>

<p>Yes. handedness (or <strong>Behavioral Lateralization</strong>) has been documented in numerous vertebrates (mammals, reptiles <em>and</em> birds) as well as invertebrates.</p>

<ul>
<li>This includes domestic cats (see <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347209002644"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wells &amp; Millsopp 2009</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3> Long Answer </h3>

<p>There have been numerous studies that have documented behavioral lateralization in many groups of animals including lower vertebrates (fish and amphibians), reptiles (even snakes!), birds and mammals. More recent work (e.g., <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3859130/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Frasnelli 2013</a>) has also shown that lateralization can also occur in invertebrates. In other words, ""handedness"" (or pawedness, footedness, eyedness, earedness, nostriledness,
toothedness, breastedness, gonadedness, etc.) occurs rather extensively across the animal kingdom. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>These studies suggest that the evolution of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">brain lateralization</a>, often linked to lateralized behaviors, may have occurred early in evolutionary history and may not have been the result of multiple independent evolutionary events as once thought.</p>

<ul>
<li>Although this view of brain lateralization as a highly conserved trait throughout evolutionary history has gained popularity, it's still contested (reviewed by <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lesley_Rogers2/publication/13705331_The_Origins_of_Cerebral_Asymmetry_A_Review_of_Evidence_of_Behavioural_and_Brain_Lateralization_in_Fishes_Reptiles_and_Amphibians/links/00b4951d6271266e30000000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bisazza et al. 1998</a>; <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lesley_Rogers2/publication/12775736_Possible_evolutionary_origins_of_cognitive_brain_lateralization/links/00b4951d62712bc632000000/Possible-evolutionary-origins-of-cognitive-brain-lateralization.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vallortigara et al. 1999</a>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Laterality of function may manifest in terms of preference (frequency) or performance (proficiency), with the former being far more often investigated.</p>

<p>And no, right-handedness is not always dominant.</p>

<p><strong>But Why?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>One hypothesis is that brain lateralization was the evolutionary result of the need to break up complex tasks and perform them with highly specialized neuronal units to avoid functional overlap (i.e., to account for ""functional incompatibility""). </p></li>
<li><p>In humans, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">many hypotheses</a> have been developed including: division of labor, genetics, epigenetic factors, prenatal hormone exposure, prenatal vestibular asymmetry, and even ultrasound exposure in the womb.</p></li>
<li><p>Snake studies (see below) have suggested lateralization behavior can be dictated by environmental conditions (specifically, temperature)</p></li>
<li><p>Other work (<a href=""http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiolett/3/2/169.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hoso et al 2007</a>) suggest that lateralization could be the result of convergent evolution. In this case, snakes developed feeding aparati that allow them to better consume more-common dextral species of snails. </p>

<ul>
<li>Note: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinistral_and_dextral"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dextral</a> (meaning ""clockwise"") is a type of chirality -- another form of ""handedness"" </li>

"Difference between going against and going down a concentration gradient","4965","","<p>The difference between facilitated diffusion and active transport is that facilitated distribution occurs down a concentration gradient and active transport occurs against a concentration gradient.

"Single hormone opposite effects","4963","","<p>Often, a smooth response to a hormone means that some processes must be sped up and others must be slowed down.</p>

<p>How can a single hormone have opposite effects like this?</p>
","<p>An hormone is not different from most other molecules. To have an effect on a cell it binds to a (more or less specific) receptor, located either on the plasma membrane or inside the cell, and it initiates an intracellular cascade of events<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>There are several ways an hormone can have different effects:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>there can be multiple receptors for the same hormone. For instance, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"" rel=""nofollow"">prolactin</a> can bind to two receptors, called prolactin receptor (PRL-R) short and long form. The short form of the receptor has been shown to lack the ability to promote milk protein genes transcription (See <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC50906/"" rel=""nofollow"">Lesueur et al., PNAS - 1991</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>the same receptor can be coupled to different intracellular pathways in different cell types / physiological conditions, thus resulting in different effects.</p></li>
<li><p>each cell type/tissue expresses a set of protein that will interact in a different manner with the intracellular cascade promoted by the hormone.</p></li>
<li><p>an hormone can interact with receptors for other molecules. For instance allopregnanolone, a metabolite of progesterone, is a potent agonist of the GABA-A receptor, giving it anxiolitic properties.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>An interesting example is that of estrogenic compound. Several receptors exist for estradiol (E2). The ""classical"" receptors are called ER-alpha and ER-beta, and they are located in the cytoplasm. The binding of E2 to the ER promotes their dimerization and entrance into the nucleus where they can promote the transcription of various genes. ERs can also bind to other transcription factors and modulate their activity. So, depending on which transcription factors are present different genes will be transcribed in response to E2. Moreover, ER-beta can have opposite effects then ER-alpha (see for instance <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC18537/"" rel=""nofollow"">Weihua et al., PNAS - 2000</a>). In addition, receptors like ERs can be activated also in absence of the endogenous hormone: for instance, dietary amino acids activate ER-alpha in liver by a mTOR-dependent phosphorylation (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21284987"" rel=""nofollow"">Della Torre et al., Cell Metabolism 2011</a>)</p>

<p>To make things more complicated, membrane receptor for estrogen have been described, such as GPR30 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15705806"" rel=""nofollow"">Revankar et al., Science - 2005</a>), membrane ""versions"" of the classical ERs, plus various splicing variants of the ERs (mostly expressed in tumoral tissue).</p>

<p>GPR30 in breasts has been shown to activate certain molecular pathways (notably Erk1/2) that contribute to cellular growth (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11043579"" rel=""nofollow"">Filardo et al., Mol Endocrinol. - 2000</a>), possibly linking it to proliferation of ER-negative breast tumours. Other tissues that do not express GPR30 will lack this E2-induced proliferative stimulus.</p>

<p>So, tissue- or time- dependent modulation of the receptors and of the intracellular pathways associated with it can allow the body to respond to the same hormone (or, more in general, to the same molecule) in opposite ways.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> This is a simplification, not every substance (and not every hormone) acts by binding to receptors, but let's keep things simple.</p>

"Why does immunity from the flu vaccine appear only after two weeks?","4931","","<p>It is said that immunity from a flu vaccine appears after about two weeks. However, from experience, the flu usually lasts only a few days. </p>

<p>If sufficient antibodies appear only after two weeks shouldn't the flu also last that long? Or is there a difference between how the body reacts to the actual flu virus as opposed to the dead one in the flu vaccine (like maybe there being more viral particles in an actual infection or something)?</p>
","<p>Most information here can be found broadly in <em>Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 8th Ed.</em></p>

<p>Here's how the flu vaccine works: Scientists forecast months in advance which strains they think stand to cause the most problems. The vaccine is often trivalent, protecting against three different strains on flu: Two influenza A and one influenza B. You can read about the process directly from the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/flushot.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">CDC</a>.</p>

<p>The two major viral receptors are neuraminidase and hemeagglutinin. They determine the serotype of the virus, such as H1N1. They serve as peptide antigens for immune recognition. Where influenza infects a cell, it starts to produce proteins essential to it's replication in the host cytoplasm.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Innate_immune_system.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>innate immunue system</strong></a>, upon realizing there's an infection, does quite a bit to try and mitigate things but it's a messy job. Looking at the link, lots of inflammation, damage and dead tissue. At that, there will be no memory of the same infection, and the same process happens over and over unless there's a better way to take care of things.</p>

<p>This is really where your adaptive immune system comes in, T/B cell, antibodies, etc. A wild type influenza virus stimulates the same adaptive response as the strains in a flu vaccine: Proteins such as the neuraminidase are picked up by macrophages or dendritic cells, and they enter transport to the closest lymph node. On the way, they chop up the viral protein into <em>peptide antigens</em> and load them onto MHC-II molecules, and export the complex to the cell surface, becoming antigen-presenting cells or APCs. T cells expressing CD4 coreceptor can interact with the MHC-II on APCs in a cascade of events that lead to effector T-helper (Th) cells. Th cells, in concert with follicular dendritic cells and recognition of cognate antigen by naive B cell can result in proliferation and differentiation of B cells to plasma cells that secrete antibodies specific to the viral antigen that was initially recognized.</p>

<p>The problem, is that this process takes time to ramp up plasma cells numbers and antibody production. The average time often denoted by literature is about <strong>2 weeks</strong>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pnBf2.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pnBf2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Furthermore, with adaptive immunity you get memory cells that will <em>remember</em> a given infection and quickly resolve it with antibodies should you ever catch the same bug.</p>

<p>The difference between our wild type influenza and the ones in the vaccine is <strong>attenuation</strong>. The point of the wild type influenza people often catch is it's really good at infecting humans, and upon infection it causes a lot of damage. We can attenuate influenza's pathogenicity by growing the flu strains in tissue that is not human. Over a few generations, the virus adapts: it becomes more pathogenic/virulent in non-human tissue, but harmless to humans. You then remove the harmful parts of the hemeagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from a wild type strain to get inert HA and NA (so that you get the wild type immunogenicity), combine them with structural proteins from the attenuated strain, and combine them to form a new, live-attenuated vaccine strain that can be grown in the non-human tissue (see image below).</p>

<p>So also keep in mind that just because your infection resolved in under 2 weeks that the antibodies you produced wont help you from getting the same bug again. During flu season it tends to come at your from all sides and the antibodies that evetually get produced help a lot.</p>

"How many abdominal sclerites would be there in a cockroach?","4926","","<p>Every tegmina of a cockroach has sclerites which are analogous to the bones of humans.</p>

<p>Every abdominal segment of cockroach consists of two lateral sclerite plates called pleura along with a dorsal terga and a ventral sterna. But what will be the case with the last body segment where 10th sternum is absent?</p>

<p>I mean will, there be any pleuron in the tenth segment because, following our textbook, pleura serve for articulation among sterna and terga and also spiracles are present in the first eight abdominal segments but the 10th sternum is absent in <em>Periplaneta americana</em>.</p>

<p>Actually there is no evidence of the presence of any pleurons in the last segment in our text book.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are no abdominal spiracles in the 9th and 10th segments so there is no particular reason to say that pleura are present in the 9th and 10th segments as well. </p>
","<h2>Tergal plates:</h2>

<p>There are ten tergal plates. The $8^{th}$ tergum in the male and both $8^{th}$ and $9^{th}$ terga in the female are not visible  as they are overlapped by the $7^{th}$ tergum.</p>

<p><strong>The $10^{th}$ tergum extends beyond the posterior end of the body and has a deep groove in the middle of its free end.</strong></p>

<h2>Sternal plates:</h2>

","<p>There’s an XKCD comic which <a href=""http://xkcd.com/882/"" rel=""nofollow"">explains the problem</a>. Unfortunately, that comic is too big to post here. Briefly, a <em>p</em>-value of 0.1 says (roughly) that there’s a 10% chance (0.1) of the observed result being as extreme<sup>1</sup> as it is simply due to chance (sampling variation from a population), <em>assuming the null hypothesis is true</em>.</p>

<p>Often, 5% is more or less arbitrarily chosen as “cut-off”: results with <em>p</em>-values below that (which occur by chance 1 time out of 20) are called <em>significant</em> – results above are insignificant.</p>

<p>However, this directly implies that when doing multiple studies, say 20, there’s a very high chance of getting a “significant” result by pure chance, without there being a real effect.</p>

<p>GWAS studies essentially perform experiments on many (hundreds or thousands) of factors simultaneously. Therefore, reporting the pure <em>p</em>-values would be very misleading since there would be a lot of spurious results with “significant” <em>p</em>-values. The probability of getting one or more spurious hits is called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familywise_error_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">familywise error rate (FWER)</a>.</p>

<p>The FWER can be reduced by <em>adjusting</em> the <em>p</em> values, for instance by performing the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction"" rel=""nofollow"">Bonferroni correction</a>. The resulting <em>p</em>-values are quite a bit higher, which reflects the reduced certainty that the result is due to chance, i.e. the reduced significance.</p>

<p>It doesn’t generally make sense to report the unadjusted <em>p</em>-value. It was probably reported here because correcting for FWER is quite conservative (i.e. it trades a low false-positive rate for an increased false-negative rate) and the authors feared that the adjusted <em>p</em>-value looked less impressive than it should. This involves a fair bit of interpretation.</p>

"Why does a cockroach not die even after decapitation?","4898","","<p>Why does a cockroach not die after its head is cut off?</p>
","<p>Based on an article <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-cockroach-can-live-without-head/"">here</a>, unlike humans, cockroaches have an open circulatory system. They don't have a huge network of blood vessels like that of humans, or tiny capillaries that you need a lot of pressure to flow blood through. Hence after you cut their heads off, very often their necks would seal off just by clotting.</p>

<p>According to the article cockroaches breathe through spiracles, or little holes in each body segment. Plus, the roach brain does not control this breathing and blood does not carry oxygen throughout the body. Rather, the spiracles pipe air directly to tissues through a set of tubes called tracheae. In addition cockroaches are poikilotherms, or cold-blooded, meaning they need much less food than humans do. Hence cockroaches can survive decapitation.</p>

  <p>How did multicellularity evolved?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It is an ongoing field of research - Some insights about the origin of multicellularity</strong></p>

<p>This is a big ongoing field of research. To start with an example, there was relatively recently (2012) an important article by <a href=""http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/veg/RatcliffEtAl2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Ratcliff et al.</a> that shows that yeast can quickly evolve multicellularity under selection on the speed they sink to lower water layers. This article is one among many others and is far from being able to explain everything we would like to understand about the evolution of multicellularity. Typically, I think that this yeast species had a multicellular ancestor and we might think that this species would already have fixed alleles (=variants of genes that is fixed meaning that the whole population is carrying this variant today) in the population predisposing this species to easily (re-)evolve multicellularity. Also they may have kept some standing additive genetic variance in their genome from their past and they would therefore very quickly respond to selection as they don't need de novo mutations. (Sorry if this last sentence was slightly technical).</p>

<p>One of the first trait that we usually refer to when talking about the evolution of multicellularity is the presence of sticky proteins allowing individual cells to paste to each others.</p>

<p><strong>Some insights about the evolution from simple multicellular to more complex multicellular</strong></p>

<p>Then, we could talk about more complex multicellular and argue how do these simple multicellular evolve into some more complex organisms. A common argument is that multicellular can have specialized cells are are very could at doing what their doing as they are specialized. Also, some level of complexity is thought to have raised due to the fact that multicellular organisms tend to have smaller population size than unicellular (see <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/302/5649/1401.short"" rel=""nofollow"">Lynch and Conery, 2003</a>). It is important not to confuse evolution of complexity with evolution of multicellularity although these two notions are somehow related.</p>

<p><strong>What do you mean by multicellularity?</strong></p>

<p>The evolution of multicellularity can be discussed in the context where sister cells form an organism together or when unrelated cells (among the same species or even cells from different species) come together to form an organism. Also, the multicellularity can be discussed at different level depending on how we want to define multicellularity. Is a stack of cells reproducing individually, working for their own benefit a multicellular? Do we need division of labor? Do we need division between germline (reproductive caste) and soma line (non-reproductive case)?</p>

<p><strong>How many times did multicellularity evolve independently?</strong></p>

<p>Some people consider that there are multicellular bacteria (biofilms) but we will avoid discussions that are based on limit-case definitions. Let's talk about eukaryotes. Most Eukaryotes are unicellular and multicellularity evolved many times independently in eukaryotes. To my knowledge, complex multicellularity however evolved only (only?) 6 times independently in eukaryotes.</p>

<li>Ascomyceta (fungi)</li>
<li>Basidiomyceta (fungi)</li>
<li>Viridiplantae (green plants)</li>
<li>Florideophyceae (red algae)</li>
<li>Laminariales (brown algae)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Model organisms and interesting cases to study multicellularity</strong></p>

<p>There are a bunch of specific clades that are particularly interested in studying multicellularity because they present transition states. For example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvox"" rel=""nofollow"">Volvox</a> is a chlorophyte genus and the species in this clade present different stages of multicellularity; Some species are exclusively multicellular, some form small groups, some create big colonies, some have some division of labor and some even have separation between the germline and the soma (Some castes don't reproduce).

"Can any plant regenerate missing tissue?","4881","","<p>I have not yet found a plant that, when an insect eats a hole in one of its leaves, it can regenerate the lost tissue. Many plants will grow a new stem if the old one is cut, but it is not a perfect regeneration, and has no likeness in form to the previous stem. Are there any plants that can, even to a degree, regenerate missing tissue?</p>
","<p>In general, plant cells only undergo differentiation at special regions in the plant known as meristems. Two of the primary types of meristem are the root apical meristem (at the tips of roots) and the shoot apical meristem (at shoot tips)^. Within the shoot apical meristem the plant cells divide and begin to differentiate into different cell types (such as different cells of the leaf, or vascular cells). Later growth (of, say, a leaf) is largely a result of cell expansion (although cell division does <a href=""http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/1/68.abstract"">still occur</a>, but drops off as the leaf expands). Therefore, if you punch a hole in a leaf, it probably won't be filled in because the cells in that leaf have finished growing and dividing.</p>

<p>However, as a shoot grows, more meristems are created. These are found in the axillary buds, just above where the leaf meets the stem. The meristems in the axillary buds can grow to form branches. Different plants obviously make different numbers of branches, but there is a common control mechanism known as apical dominance, where the meristem at the tip of the shoot suppresses the growth of the lower axillary buds. This is why a shoot with no branches can be made to grow branches by cutting off the tip (gardeners often do this to make ""leggy"" plants more bushy).</p>

<p>All of that was a long explanation to say, no, a plant doesn't normally^^ regenerate in the sense of filling in cells that have gone missing. However, if you cut off a shoot, the next remaining bud might begin to grow and, in a sense, replace the part that was lost. In that case, an existing bud is recruited to form a new branch and replace lost functionality, but I wouldn't say that qualifies as regenerating missing tissue.</p>

<p>^There are other types of meristem as well.</p>

<p>^^If you torture plant cells enough you can force them to become ""stem cells"" and thereby make an entirely new plant, but this is rare in nature.</p>

"Thermodynamics of spontaneous protein folding: role of enthalpy changes","4857","","<p>I'm trying to get clear why protein folding occurs spontaneously.</p>

<p>$$\ce\Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S$$</p>

<p>According to thermodynamics the ΔG should be negative for a process to occur spontaneously.
When a protein folds the ΔS (Entropy) is decreasing, because the protein gets more ordered. However I think the forming of the bonds (disulfide and other weak interactions) counterbalance this unfavourable rising entropy by forming an enthalpy (ΔH) which thus would result in a negative ΔG.</p>

<p>However I saw some other explanation online which didn't apply the Gibbs free energy formula to the protein but instead to the water. Because the water is more ordered when the protein is unfolded it would be favourable according to the second law of thermodynamics to fold the protein because after folding the water molecules can move more freely --> higher entropy -->negative ΔG --> spontaneous folding.</p>

<p>So my question is which of these two (or maybe both) are the cause of the spontaneous folding of proteins?</p>
","<p><strong>Summary</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>The first explanation is commonly encountered.</li>
<li>The second explanation cannot be correct, <em>as it stands</em>, as it ignores the free energy change in the protein.</li>
<li>A modification of the second explanation (perhaps what was intended) is that it is necessary to consider the protein folding and change in the water as being coupled, in which case the overall free energy change — the sum of the two considered separately — is the determinant of protein folding. The assertion would then be that a negative free-energy change in the water system is the deciding factor. This view has been persuasively advocated on the basis of experimental measurements.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Free energy change in individual transformations</strong></p>

<p>It is <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22584/#A1024"" rel=""nofollow"">standard practice in biochemistry</a> to consider the Gibbs Free Energy of transformation of the sort A → B in isolation in determining whether it will proceed spontaneously. A chemical reaction for which ΔG is negative may generate heat (i.e. have a negative enthalpy change (ΔH) ) which affects its aqueous surroundings, but it seems justified to consider the reaction in isolation as there is no sense that the change in the vibration of the water molecules is driving or coupled to the reaction.</p>

<p>This approach has been applied to the structural change of protein folding with the conclusion (consistent with the first explanation) that the change in enthalpy (ΔH) is sufficient to produce a negative ΔG and hence drive protein folding (Citation 1, below).</p>

<p><strong>Free energy change in coupled transformations</strong>
Many biochemical changes involve transformations which individually have a positive free energy change, but are made possible by coupling to another reaction with negative free energy change, of greater magnitude:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A → B , ΔG<sub>1</sub> = +x</p>
  
  <p>C → D , ΔG<sub>2</sub> = –y</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If y>x and these two reactions are coupled (generally through a complex reaction path on an enzyme) , then we have:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A + C → B + D , ΔG<sub>overall</sub> = –ve</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>See</em> also <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22439/#A1946"" rel=""nofollow"">Berg et al.</a></p>

<p>Although one can reject the second explanation in the question as it stands because it ignores the free energy change in the protein folding, perhaps it was intended to mean that the folding of the protein (A → B) should be considered as coupled to the change in the environment of the water (C → D), and that the negative ΔG for the aqueous environment made a greater contribution to the overall ΔG than that for the protein folding.</p>

<p>Is it valid to consider these two systems as coupled? In the original version of my answer I argued against this point of view, but am no longer convinced by my own arguments. The water environment is clearly essential for the hydrophobic effect — the burying of the hydrophobic residues in the centre of the protein away from the water. This is evident if one considers the same protein in a hydrophobic environment such as a cell membrane — it would not fold. In membrane proteins it is hydrophobic residues that are exposed to the lipid bilayer and it is their interiors that sometimes have hydrophilic channels.</p>

<p>So in this coupled system, what is the determinant of the negative free energy change? Minikel (Citation 2, below) asserts that there is no net enthalpy change for the protein folding, and it is the entropy effect on the ΔG for the aqueous environment that drives the folding. He indicates that this view is supported by differential scanning colorimetry and, although he doesn’t cite references, there is a recent (if rather complex) review of this topic by <a href=""http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0003986112003530/1-s2.0-S0003986112003530-main.pdf?_tid=c08a2650-74dc-11e6-9906-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1473240395_78073e74c201dfcd5247cc4a94b0a3a7"" rel=""nofollow"">Christopher M. Johnson</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Citation 1: Assertion of role of ΔH of protein</strong></p>

<p>The following explanation, taken from <a href=""http://www.wiley.com/college/pratt/0471393878/student/review/thermodynamics/7_relationship.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Essential Biochemistry</a>, treats the protein folding in isolation and asserts that change in enthalpy is sufficient to produce a negative free energy change:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The folding of a protein also provides an example of the ""ΔH"" and ""–TΔS"" terms competing with one another to determine the ΔG of the folding process. As described above, the change in entropy of the protein as it folds is negative, so the ""–TΔS"" term is positive. However, in addition to entropic effects there are enthalpic contributions to protein folding. These include hydrogen bonding, ionic salt bridges, and Van der Waals forces. An input of thermal (heat) energy is required to disrupt these forces, and conversely when these interactions form during protein folding they release heat (the ΔH is negative). When all of these entropic and enthalpic contributions are weighed, the enthalpy term wins out over the entropy term. Therefore the free energy of protein folding is negative, and protein folding is a spontaneous process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Citation 2: Rebuttal of role of ΔH of protein and assertion of role of water</strong></p>

<p>The following explanation, taken from <a href=""http://www.cureffi.org/2014/09/05/molecular-biology-02/"" rel=""nofollow"">on-line lecture notes</a> of  of Eric V. Minikel of Harvard University, rebutting the point of view above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An incorrect and simplistic view of protein folding is as follows. An unfolded protein has high configurational entropy but also high enthalpy because it has few stabilizing interactions. A folded protein has far less entropy, but also far less enthalpy. There is a tradeoff between H and S here. Note that because ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, increased temperature weights the S term more heavily, meaning that higher temperature favors unfolding.</p>
  
  <p>That entire explanation only considers the energy of the protein and
  not that of the solvent. In fact, hydrophobic domains of a protein
  constrain the possible configurations of surrounding water (see
  explanation above), and so their burial upon folding increases the
  water’s entropy. Moreover, it turns out that the hydrogen bonding of
  polar residues and the backbone is satisfied both in an unfolded state
  (by water) and in a folded state (by each other). Therefore enthalpy
  is “zero sum,” and protein folding is driven almost entirely by
  entropy.</p>

</ol>
","<p>Animals and plants are both classified as Eukaryotes, and as such can form large, complex, multi-cellular organisms. There are several major differences at the cellular level that distinguish the 2 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_%28biology%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kingdoms</a> (Animalia and Plantae). Without getting technical, the most crucial difference in relation to your question is that plants contain <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll"" rel=""noreferrer"">chlorophyll</a>, and as such can generate their own food using sunlight.</p>

<p>This is very important when you consider that plants (by definition, those Eukaryotes that contain chlorophyll) have therefore evolved to be very efficient at converting sunlight to 'energy', whereas animals have evolved without this option and have to eat what food they need. So they have instead evolved mechanisms that allow them to forage, or even to hunt, for their food.</p>

<p>At some point, a unicellular organism incorporated chlorophyll, leading to multicellular plants in the course of evolution. The ancestor of animals evolved independently from the last common ancestor of plants and animals. Therefore, plants and animals are quite diverged, e.g. in mating 'rituals' (in plants this involves flowers and seeds - whereas in animals there are mating and gestation periods), and systemic changes, such as the immune system and the circulatory system (these are generally much more complex in animals than plants). All of which has stemmed from the difference in evolutionary pressures applied by the choice of food-source.</p>

<p>As you have pointed out, there are exceptions to all rules, so not all plants have chlorophyll, but as a rule it is the case!

<p>The correct answer is D, but I think it should be B. I can only think about three layers as maximum which are; epithelium of alveolus, endothelium of capillaries and the membrane of red blood cell. I don't know what are remainings.</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>
","<p>Oxigen goes from the alveolar's lumen to the cytoplasm of the erythrocyte, and that's 5 membranes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ""top"" of the alveolar epithelial cell</li>
<li>the ""bottom"" of such cell</li>
<li>the ""top"" of the endothelial cell (capillary)</li>
<li>the ""bottom"" of such cell</li>
<li>the erythrocyte membrane</li>
</ul>

<p>You got all the cells right, but your only problem was this: oxygen diffuses through the cell membrane <em>entering</em> the cell, moves through the cytoplasm, and diffuses through the membrane again <em>exiting</em> the cell. So, for each cell, you have to count 2 membranes. For the last one, the erythrocyte, you have only 1 membrane (because it is O2 final destination). </p>

<p>For the CO2 the situation is a little bit more tricky. We have the same 4 membranes (2x epithelial cell and 2x capillary), but CO2 can come from 2 locations:</p>

<ul>
<li>from the erythrocyte, where it is formed from H2CO3 (by the reaction H2CO3 --> H2O + CO2) or released from the N-terminal group of proteins, like haemoglobin (where it has previously bound)</li>
<li>from the plasma (around 9% of the CO2).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first case we have 5 membranes, and in the second case just 4.</p>

<p>So, the correct answer is D.</p>

"What is the purpose of back-crossing mice for multiple generations?","4831","","<p>Occasionally I will come across articles that refer to back-crossing mice of one strain onto the background other another strain (e.g., C57Bl6). They do not explicitly state the purpose for doing so, but I can infer that the change of strain is to relate their findings to what is already known using the new strain (e.g., C57Bl6). Usually the back-crosses are performed for 5-10 generations. Is this to try to remove (epi)genetic variation from the original strain relative to the new strain, or is it more about normalizing expression of a particular allelic variant (e.g., knocking-in a transgene)?</p>
","<p>Depending on the exact goal of the experiment, the researchers may back-cross both to smooth out genetic variation between individuals and to potentially normalize expression of a transgene, although once you get past the chimeric stage gene expression should be fairly stable. In my experience, back-crossing allows you to generate a genetically-altered mouse that differs as little as possible from a (generally well-characterized) parent strain, except at the locus of the genetic manipulation. This way, any differences in phenotype can more easily be explained by the knockout/knockin/transgene/what-have-you, and not by any variations in background genetics. </p>

<p>As an example, <a href=""http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/000664.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C57BL/6</a> mice, being inbred, have a number of well-known mutations, deficiencies, resistances, etc., and for one reason or another have become one of the most popular and most-characterized mouse strains in biology, so there is a great interest in continuing research using a well-known historical model with so much extant experimental data. These mice are quite different from the <a href=""http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/002448.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">129</a> strain, which are frequently used to make initial genetically modified strains due to the large number of embryonic stem cell lines available, and other technical reasons which allow for the relatively easy generation of transgenics, etc. However, for various other reasons, 129s aren't used as often in the type of studies that BL/6s are, so it's preferable to create the mutation in a 129, then back-cross it onto a BL/6 background. Both of these strains are quite homogenous from one individual to another (each sibling is practically a twin of the next), but once you start breeding 129s to BL/6s you can generate all sorts of genetic heterogeneity due to random cross-overs and all the other things we like to talk so much about around here when it comes to mutations and meiosis. As anyone who has worked with genetic diseases in humans will readily tell you, it can be extraordinarily difficult to nail down specific genotypes that lead to specific phenotypes when there are so many other confounding factors present. Backcrossing a mutant 5, 10, or even 20 or more generations back onto a reference strain is one of the best ways we have at the moment of controlling for all the genetic variations that are introduced when two inbred ""tool"" strains are bred together.</p>

"How do dopamine agonists like amphetamine/methylphenidate affect acetylcholine signalling?","4829","","<p>Do they increase it, or is the effect mostly neutral?</p>
","<p><strong>Amphetamine and methylphenidate are not (direct) dopamine agonists.</strong></p>

<p>Dopamine agonists are the substances that would specifically bind to dopamine receptors and activate them, thereby mimicking the effects of dopamine release.</p>

<p>Amphetamine/methylphenidate are so-called <strong>indirect sympatomimetics.</strong> This means that they stimulate the simpatyc nervous systems (with neurotransmitters noradrenaline and dopamine in CNS), but in indirect way: they don't bind to the receptors. Rather, they promote the massive neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic part. The released transmitter (DA, NA) then just diffuses to the postsynaptic membrane and binds to its own receptors.</p>

<p>There are some works done on investigating the effect of these substances on parasympatic system with acetylcholine as neurotransmitter.</p>

<p>Sympatomimetics like amphetamine generally lead to increase of acetylcholine release throurout the nervous system: in <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8405105"" rel=""nofollow"">hippocampus and caudate nucleus</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9881866"" rel=""nofollow"">nucleus accumbens</a> and generally in <a href=""http://www.amphetamines.com/acetylcholine/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">forebrain and cortex</a>.</p>

"Why can hair grow without limit while eyebrow cannot?","4771","","<p>I cut my eyebrow and it grows until reach a certain length. Hair can grow without limit.
Why can hair grow without limit while eyebrow cannot?</p>
","<p>Hair actually does have a limit to its growth. All hair cycles between periods where it grows, and when a new stand appears, which pushes the older, long hair out. Hairs that are generally shorter, like eyebrows or arm hairs, have a shorter growth period before a new hair pushes the old one out. The hair on your head actually grows much faster than many other hairs as well, so with the longer cycle and the faster growth, it can grow to be much longer before being replaced.</p>

<p>I remember hearing that for many women (the cycle does vary from individual to individual, which explains why some men can't grow beards while others look like ZZ Top) the growth cycle ends between the waist and butt.</p>

<p>My speculation would be that hair on the head could grow for longer because there are more capillaries in the scalp, which might lead to more nutrients, higher cell turnover (like you see in dandruff), and hence more hair. That's just a guess, mind you.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Long, Confusing and Out-Dated Details</h2>

<p>The terms peptone and proteose were first used in the late 19th century, which makes finding substantive definitions, well, difficult. I refer you to the following paper (yes, 1891...). It is not the first to discuss proteoses, but I can't find any earlier ones and the explanation is quite clear (emphasis added).</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1514217/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chittenden RH, Hartwell JA. 1891. The Relative Formation of Proteoses and Peptones in Gastric Digestion. J Physiol 12:12-22.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the digestion of proteid matter by pepsin-hydrochloric acid there are three well-defined products or classes of products, viz. acid-albumin or syntonin, albumoses or proteoses, and peptones. We look upon the first as the initial product of gastric digestion and identify it by its well known precipitation by neutralization. In the filtrate, <strong>the [proteoses] can be detected... best by saturation with ammonium sulphate, while the true peptones... are found in the filtrate from the latter precipitate</strong>... True peptones are bodies not precipitated by saturation with ammonium sulphate, and are the final products of pepsin digestion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>NB: <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/proteid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proteid = protein</a></em></p>

<p>So, according to this paper (and apparently ""all physiologists"" at the time, see below), there are three main products resulting from pepsin-acid digestion of protein:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/syntonin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">syntonin</a> - the initial product, precipitates upon neutralization (likely due to acid denaturation)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/proteose"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proteose</a> - the main product after continued digestion, characterized by precipitation with saturating ammonium sulfate

<blockquote>
  <p>Study of the individual proteoses formed in the gastric digestion of albumin, fibrin, globulin, myosin, casein and other proteids has seemingly already shown that these so-called preliminary bodies are the main products of the digestive action of pepsin</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amphopeptone#English"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">peptone</a> - the final product of digestion, does not precipitate with saturating ammonium sulfate

<blockquote>
  <p>All physiologists are presumably agreed that peptone is the final product of gastric digestion</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>They further emphasize that peptone is a product of continued proteose digestion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the discovery of the [proteoses] and of their characteristics, frequent study of digestive mixtures has given convincing proof that in an ordinary gastric digestion of any common proteid only a comparatively small amount of peptone is formed; peptonization in the true sense of the word results only from the long-continued action of pepsin-acid, and even then complete peptonization rarely if ever occurs. The... proteoses are to be considered as the primary products of gastric digestion, while peptones are the end products of proteolytic action, the latter being formed by the gradual hydration of the primary products...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that peptone differs from proteose only in the length of its constituent peptides, with peptone containing shorter peptides due to continued proteose digestion. However, a more recent paper (with more recent meaning 1924) challenged this view and claimed that both proteose and peptone consist of small peptides which differ in amino acid composition rather than length. In their view, different composition rather than length explains their differential solubility in saturating ammonium sulfate.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/icb/journal/v1/n4/abs/icb192421a.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rudd GV. 1924. Proteoses, Peptones, and Polypeptides. Aust J Exp Biol Med Sci 1:187-190.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...each fraction must consist of a mixture of comparatively simple peptides, which differ among themselves in the amino-acid units of which they are constituted. The fact that some, at least, of these peptides are precipitated by ammonium sulphate shows that they belong to the group of proteoses, which therefore are partially, if not entirely, made up of simple peptides.</p>
  
  <p><strong>It is possible that the terms, ""proteose,"" ""peptone,"" and ""polypeptide,*' will all have to be considered to apply to substances of the nature of peptides... each built up of a small number of amino-acid units and differing from each other, not so much in the number of amino-acids in the molecule, but rather in the variety of these acids.</strong> The differences in solubility in various solutions shown by these compounds are thus to be attributed to differences in their chemical constitution, rather than in their molecular complexity. <strong>If this be so, these substances would be considered, not as successive stages in hydrolysis, but as products of one completed stage, differing in their solubility's.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also quote another paper with supporting evidence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fischer produced tripeptides and tetrapeptides of known composition and structure, which were precipitated when their aqueous solutions were saturated with ammonium sulphate. If these peptides were found in the solution obtained by the hydrolysis of a protein with pepsin they would be classed as proteoses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn't able to find any subsequent research. Nevertheless, such definitions from this period are based on macroscopic physical, rather than molecular, properties of the substance. This old terminology is not particularly informative in modern biology, and it would seem that they remain in use only as historic anachronisms. Today, both peptone and proteose are terms used almost exclusively when describing microbiological culture media (which dates from the period) or when making general reference to digestion products. In fact, they are often used in conjunction (ie proteose-peptone) which suggests they are now synonymous.</p>

"X Linked Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium Problem","4743","","<blockquote>
  <p>In a given population under Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, 40.0% of men have hemophilia. What is the probability that a random man and random woman will have a daughter with haemophilia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the answer is 16%, but the answer given is 9.6%. According to  Hardy-Weinberg principle, p<sup>2</sup> + 2pq + q<sup>2</sup> = 1. In order to inherit the disease, the mother must either be a carrier of have the disease, which occurs with probability 1-q<sup>2</sup> = 0.72</p>

<p>Therefore, the odds of having a child with the disease is (0.84)(0.4). Since it asks for the probability of a girl, the total must be divided by two, so the answer is 0.168</p>

<p>Where am I wrong?</p>
","<p>I make it 8%. Here is my reasoning.</p>

<p>The gene is X-linked.</p>

<p>40% mutant males, so freq(mutant allele) = p = 0.4, and freq(wt allele) = q = 0.6</p>

<p>To get a mutant female we have to have a mutant male parent, probability = 0.4
Of these matings one half will produce a female offspring so 0.4*0.5 = 0.2 </p>

<p>i.e. 20% of matings derive from a mutant male and produce a female offspring.</p>

<p>Now look at the female mate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>probability(mutant) = p<sup>2</sup> = 0.16</p>
  
  <p>probability(carrier) = 2pq = 0.48</p>
  
  <p>probability(wt) = q<sup>2</sup> = 0.36</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so our 20% of matings that have the potential to produce a mutant female offspring partition as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>mating with a mutant female:</strong> 0.2 x 0.16 = <em>0.032 mutant female offspring</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>mating with a carrier female:</strong> 0.2 x 0.48 = 0.096 of which:</p>
  
  <p><em>0.048 mutant female offspring</em></p>
  
  <p>0.048 carrier female offspring</p>
  
  <p><strong>mating with wt female:</strong> 0.2 x 0.36 = 0.072 carrier female offspring</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(sanity check - 0.032 + 0.096 + 0.072 = 0.2)</p>

<p>Thus the probability of random mating producing a mutant female is 0.032 + 0.048 = 0.08 (8%)</p>

<p>Incidentally there is another way of thinking about this. Note that the H-W frequency of mutant females in the population is 16%. One of the assumptions of H-W is random mating. So the probability of a random mating producing a mutant female = p(female) * p(mutant if female) = 0.5 x 0.16 = 0.08</p>

<p>So - where have I gone wrong?</p>

"What is a catalytic domain of an enzyme?","4735","","<p>Is this another name for the active site of an enzyme? What does the structure of the catalytic domain of an enzyme look like?</p>
","<p>Both parts overlap. Proteins are a chain of linked amino acids. This chain can be grouped into functional units which are called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">protein domains</a>. Usually all parts of a domain are closely located in the protein and they form functional domains in the 3D structure of the protein. Proteins usually contain more than one domain (these are manifold but for example can be dimerization, activation or binding domains).</p>

<p>The catalytic domain is the part of the protein chain which contains the region where the catalyzed chemical reaction takes place. The 3D structure of the catalytic domain forms the active site, so the enzyme requires proper folding to be active. If you denature the enzyme, the catalytic domain will still be present (as this is a function of the protein sequence) but the active site will be gone.</p>

<p>As there are really many enzymes for all kinds of reactions it is hard to define a general form for the active site. A motif which is present in a lot of enzymes is the the form of a catalytic pocket or groove to which only the correct substrate of the enzyme has access. Additionally the binding of the substrate to the enzyme often induces a conformational change in the protein which closes this pocket. When the reaction is finished and the substrate is not bound anymore by the enzyme, the conformation changes again and releases the products of the reaction. See the image for a schematically drawing of this principle (image from <a href=""http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Wikitexts/Sacramento_City_College/SCC%3A_Chem_309/Chapters/16%3A_Proteins_and_Enzymes/16.6%3A_Enzymatic_Catalysis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>):</p>

"Are human chromosomes connected or separate molecules?","4729","","<p>Do the 46 human chromosomes form a single unbroken DNA helix?  Or is it rather that a human's genome consists of 46 disconnected helices?  </p>

<p>If it is the former, does the common numbering scheme for the chromosomes have any correlation to their actual ordering in the one large strand?</p>

<p>If is the latter, is there a convention on how the chromosomes are ordered in genomic datasets?  Also, is there a clear understanding of how sister chromosomes ""find"" each other in Meiosis I?</p>

<p>Generally, during periods when Mitosis/Meiosis are not occurring,  what's a good physical picture for how the chromosomes are physically arranged (e.g. a bowl of 46 spaghetti noodles, or maybe the sister chromosomes always stay close together, etc)</p>

<p>thanks! </p>
","<p>Each chromosome is a pair of distinct, separate DNA molecules.  A chromosome of an eukaryotic cell nucleus is a (long) helix of two linear molecules and so has two ends, which are called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"" rel=""nofollow"">telomeres</a>.  DNA naturally forms a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_double_helix"" rel=""nofollow"">double helix</a> with its complementary DNA molecule, and the double helix can further curl in what are called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA%20supercoil"" rel=""nofollow"">supercoils</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What percent of the population has what type of synesthesia?</strong>   </p>
","<p><strong>The phenomenon</strong></p>

<p>Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which a stimulus in one sensory or cognitive pathway triggers an experience in another.  Some hallmarks:<sup>1</sup> </p>

<ul>
<li>It tends to be developmental, arising early in childhood. </li>
<li>It is involuntary.</li>
<li>It is stable over time (i.e. the same stimulus leads to the same sensory experience).  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Epidemiology</strong></p>

<p>The best paper I found on the issue is by <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17076063"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Simner et al, 2006</a>.<sup>2</sup> The authors first review prior literature on the topic and then describe their own methodology and study addressing the question of prevalence. Regarding prior research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Estimates of the prevalence of synesthesia have diverged widely....estimates range from 1 in 4.....to 1 in 25000 - 100 000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not so helpful. </p>

<p>They point out some problems with prior studies: one group of surveys relied on self-referral and made the (conservative) assumption that all non-responders to an invitation to participate were non-synesthetes. Another set of studies avoided this problem by questioning every member of a participant pool but established the prevalence only “subjectively” (their wording, although I note that this is an inherently subjective phenomenon!). </p>

<p>Simner's own group used a validated survey questionnaire about specific synesthetic experiences (the specificity and prior validation of this overcoming the  ""subjective"" aspect in their view). They found an overall prevalence of 4.4% for any type of synesthesia. Importantly, the male: female ratio was not significantly different from 1 in this group, in contrast to many prior studies which have found a marked female predominance, ranging from 2:1 to 5:1 (references in Simner's paper for those interested).</p>

<p><strong>Modalities of experience</strong></p>

<p>To address your question about the types of sensory experience involved, I turn to a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22428428"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more recent review article</a><sup>1</sup> that compiled results from multiple studies. In this report, grapheme-color type synesthesia was most common (86%). These participants see a number or letter and experience a particular color in association. This was followed by followed by time-space type (62%), a group who associates units of time with a particular space relative to their body.  The third most common was music-color type (41%), which is fairly straightforward. The majority experienced more than one type (clearly, given the percentages). </p>

<p>Here is a graph showing the percentage of the cohort who reported particular synesthetic experiences, grouped according to the category of inducer: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZQmjq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Note that the most common type mentioned above, grapheme-color, includes all three of the first categories - ""digits,"" ""letters,"" and  ""words"" on this graph. Although only the inducers are listed here, the most common associated perceptions were indeed color (97%), followed by spatial configurations (62%). In most cases the color was static (73%) but in some people it moved in a specific direction (16%).  </p>

"How does the body switch between aerobic and anaerobic respiration?","4713","","<p>Lets take the case of a person doing heavy exercise. Aerobic respiration is taking place, but oxygen is about to be finished up. Glycolysis occurs, Krebs cycle finishes. Now NADH and FADH<sub>2 </sub> enter electron transport system (ETS) to form ATP, but at the last step, cytochrome c oxidase cannot get oxygen as it just finished up. Now, what happens to the ongoing ETS? Does it go in reverse order and then arnon cycle to get back Acetyl co-A and respire anaerobically, or does this process get paused and respiration switches over to anaerobic mode till oxygen supply is replenished?</p>
","<p>I think both @David and @SatwikPasani have given nice answers, but none of them seems complete and involving all details. So I am posting another answer which involves much of the required details for benefit of readers as well as myself.</p>

<p>The simplest answer would be that cell switches from aerobic to anaerobic respiration via allosteric inhibition of enzymes from product build-up. The details, in a stepwise manner, go as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the absence of oxygen, mitochondria activate a factor known as hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)<sup><a href=""http://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.02.011."" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></sup>. HIF-1 helps in slowly shutting down the electron transport chain. This happens as HIF-1 induces subunit switching from cytochrome-c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 1 (COX<sub>4-1</sub>) to COX<sub>4-2</sub><sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17418790"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a></sup>. Also, HIF-1 induces activation of micro-RNA 210 (mir-210)<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19782034"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3</a></sup>, which blocks expression of iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins ISCU1/2<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19808020"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">4</a></sup>, which are required for the function of complex I<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20885442"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">5</a></sup>, COX<sub>10</sub><sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20498629"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">6</a></sup>, aconitase and subunit D of succinate dehydrogenase. Apart from this, in decreased levels of O<sub>2</sub>, nitric oxide (NO) causes inhibition of respiration and even cell death<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11861645"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">7</a></sup>. Also, nitric oxide synthase is a target of HIF-1<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10679484"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">8</a></sup>. You can understand this by this diagram<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3063979"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">9</a></sup>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SuziE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SuziE.jpg"" alt=""electron transport chain""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Now, shutting down electron transport chain causes accumulation of NADH (and FADH<sub>2</sub>) in the mitochondrion. This build up, in turn, shuts another process known as malate-aspartate shuttle (MA shuttle), which is essentially a process to indirectly transfer NADH from cytosol to mitochondrion since mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malate-aspartate_shuttle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">10</a></sup>. Now, since malate-aspartate shuttle is not working anymore, thus NADH remains in the cytosol. See this through the diagram below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b7qRN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b7qRN.png"" alt=""malate aspartate shuttle""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Another point is that accumulation of NADH in the mitochondrion shuts down krebs cycle. It is so because two of the main enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenase and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, both of which require the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> to function, are inhibited by the presence of NADH<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22347/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">11</a></sup>. Also, aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase are inhibited by mir-210 as already discussed. Thus, inhibition of krebs cycle occurs, which leads to accumulation of acetyl-coA. See the diagram below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPivn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPivn.png"" alt=""krebs cycle""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Now, accumulation of both NADH and acetyl-coA inhibit the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1077495/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">12</a></sup>, which leads to accumulation of pyruvic acid in the mitochondrion. This is also clear from the above diagram.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, since pyruvic acid is not being metabolized, it is hence no more transported from cytosol to mitochondrion. Transportation of pyruvic acid from cytosol (after glycolysis) to mitochondrion (for krebs cycle) requires mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Now, presence of malate is shown to promote the activity of MPC<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4413336"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">13</a></sup>. But since krebs cycle has already stopped, so no more malate is being produced. Also, since malate is not metabolized through MA shuttle (see second point), so it travels back into the cytoplasm (or is not produced at all). Thus, activity of MPC is significantly reduced. Apart from this, $\alpha$-keto acids are known to inhibit the activity of MPC<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4418160"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">14</a></sup>. Thus, due to accumulation of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate (which is not metabolized by $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, see third point), activity of MPC is further reduced. Because of these effects, pyruvate remains in the cytosol. See the following diagram for clarification<sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3834494/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">15</a></sup>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WXBXR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WXBXR.jpg"" alt=""mitochondrial pyruvate carrier""></a></p></li>
<li><p>In the last step, accumulation of pyruvic acid as well as of NADH in the cytosol together promote anaerobic respiration since in this process, NADH is converted to NAD<sup>+</sup>, which is possible due to the presence of NADH. This is also helpful since it not only helps in decreasing the accumulation of cytosolic NADH, but also in metabolizing the NADH generated from glycolysis. Finally, the complete process can be visualized by the following <a href=""https://www.studyblue.com/#flashcard/view/2239491"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">diagram</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Akmzx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Akmzx.jpg"" alt=""respiration""></a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>P.S.:</em> However, accumulation of lactate does not happen (i.e. a question like <em>What if excess lactate inhibits anaerobic respiration?</em> would not make sense) because lactate is readily removed from the cytosol to outside the cell so that it is transported to the liver, where it is converted back into glucose. This process is known as Cori Cycle<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_cycle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">16</a></sup>. See this diagram:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VrAVk.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VrAVk.png"" alt=""cori cycle""></a></p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> A <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4550"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">novel research</a> has concluded that extracellular acidosis (induced by release of lactic acid), causes a dramatic increase in efficiency of ATP production by mitochondria during hypoxia(!). Under neutral hypoxia (without acidosis), mitochondria get fragmented and lead to impaired ATP production, causing cell death. But under acidosis-hypoxia, mitochondria become unusually elongated (by inhibiting DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=npg&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11514614&amp;dopt=Abstract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">17</a></sup> and inducing mitochondrial fusion via Stress-Induced Mitochondrial Hyperfusion (SIMH) pathway<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=npg&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=19360003&amp;dopt=Abstract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">18</a></sup>), cristae get remodelled through OPA1<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=npg&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16839885&amp;dopt=Abstract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">19</a></sup> which protects and maintains ATP production in the cell in hypoxia. See this diagram:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tA1GE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tA1GE.jpg"" alt=""hypoxia""></a></p>

<p>Since the whole process is reversible (by bringing extracellular pH to neutral), thus a dynamic equilibrium can be attained in cells with high oxygen demand, like neurons, through which cell can maintain high ATP production even in hypoxia.</p>

"How do liver and lung metastases cause death?","4684","","<p>Metastasis to the liver and lungs are the main causes of death in colorectal cancer.(1)
I understand that colorectal cancer may have metastases. But how do these metastases cause death?</p>

<p>Reference</p>

<p>(1) A. Bolocan, D. Ion, D.N. Ciocan, D.N Paduraru. <em>Chirurgia</em> (2012) 107:555-563. Introduction.</p>
","<p>Metastasis is the spreading of cancerous cells to a new site within the body where they form a secondary tumour.  There is nothing special about how these metastases cause death, they do so in the same ways as the primary cancer eventually might:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replacing functional cells with non-functional cancerous cells</li>
<li>Eroding into other tissues and disrupting normal body architecture </li>
<li>Causing haemorrhage </li>
<li>Putting pressure onto other structures</li>
</ul>

<p>If we apply those principles to lung and liver secondary tumours, it is easy to see why they are likely to contribute significantly to mortality.  </p>

<p>Cancerous masses in the lungs reduce the surface area available for gas exchange, reducing oxygen saturation of the patient.  The tumour may also erode into a primary bronchus, which if obstructed would cause lung collapse, or into the mediastinum.  If the mediastinum is involved then the great vessels or heart may be invaded into with significant consequences.  </p>

<p>Liver metastases are more likely to cause problems due to the reduction of liver function as the cancer grows. This causes a plethora of problems as the liver is involved in so many pathways within the body.  Examples of serious effects would include the patient becoming coagulopathic due to a reduction in production of clotting factors, making bleeding much more severe.  The liver can begin to fail to clear toxins from the blood, leading to the risk of acidosis or hepatic encephalopathy (leading to coma and eventual death).  If the tumour were to invade the portal vein, this can cause portal hypertension, which in turn shunts pressure into the systemic venous system.  This can cause oesophageal varices which are prone to spontaneous and catastrophic bleeding. Similarly a tumour invading the common bile duct (or other part of the biliary tree) can cause obstructive jaundice and associated problems. </p>

<p>The reason your quote suggests that most deaths are from metastases than the primary tumour is probably because tumours in these locations have greater negative effects at a smaller size because they are in crucial tissues.  </p>

<p>There may be another contributing factor in the form of data interpretation, however.  Tumours are often 'staged' via the <a href=""http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/type/bowel-cancer/treatment/tnm-and-number-stages-of-bowel-cancer"" rel=""nofollow"">TNM staging system</a>, the last component of which is the presence of metastases.  The presence of distal metastases automatically makes colorectal cancer Stage 4.  This is often considered not to be curable, meaning a move to more palliative treatment options.  This may affect the survival curves for those with distal metastases and those without.</p>

<p>In the photo above (given by Bio teacher), the muscle bundle is shown to be as a bundle of fascicles, but in most web definitions I've seen, the two terms are used interchangeably. What is the correct name for the part labeled ""muscle bundle"" if there are in fact no distinctions between bundle and fascicle?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Muscle fascicles are the building blocks of skeletal muscle.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle"" rel=""nofollow"">Skeletal muscle, or striated muscle</a> is composed of many units called <a href=""http://www.ivyroses.com/Define/Fascicle"" rel=""nofollow"">muscle fascicles</a>. The fascicles are bound together by a type of connective tissue called <a href=""https://www.anatomytrains.com/fascia/"" rel=""nofollow"">fascia</a>.</p>

<p>Fascicles in skeletal muscle are composed of muscle cells, called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"" rel=""nofollow"">mycocytes</a>. These cells are referred to as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"" rel=""nofollow"">muscle fibers</a> in skeletal muscle. Myocytes contain small strands called <a href=""http://www.ivyroses.com/Define/Myofibril"" rel=""nofollow"">myofibrils</a>, which are the contractile elements in the muscle cells. The myofibrils move as skeletal muscle contracts.</p>

<p>Putting it all back together, myofibrils are the contractile elements in muscle cells (muscle fibers); muscle fibers make-up muscle fascicles; and muscle fascicles are bound together by fascia to compose the skeletal muscle.</p>

<p>Hence the part labeled 'muscle bundle' is a <strong>muscle</strong>, made out of a <strong>bundle of fascicles</strong>. </p>

"Why are vaccines for polio taken orally while vaccines for TB need to be injected?","4676","","<p>My thoughts are that maybe the TB antigens necessary to produce an immune response are proteins; therefore they can be digested in the stomach and small intestine. But I may be wrong though. I am confused why I can't say the same for polio vaccine.</p>
","<p>There are different polio vaccines - one live (attenuated) vaccine which is given orally and one inactivated, which is injected. The main reason for using the live orally vaccine is that it provides excellent immunity (better than the inactivated) since it uses the natural infection route (oral-faecal) in the body where it enters through cells in the intestine. Besides that, it is also much less expensive than the inactivated form, which is a big thing when doing mass immunisations in developing countries.</p>

<p>The live vaccine, however, may mutate back into a more infectious form as you shed live (attenuated) viruses after the immunisation, so these are not used anymore. Now we are very close to the eradication of the poliovirus. The risk of getting new infections is viewed as being too high these days.

"On average how many genes / alleles do people share?","4660","","<p>I am curious about how much more a child can be alike to one parent than the other. If a child were to inherit all the alleles that are shared between both parents from one parent, but inherit all alleles from the other parent which the first parent doesn't possess, wouldn't this make the child genetically more uniquely similar to the second parent? </p>

<p>This question would be aided by understanding of how many alleles on average a person already shares with another person. Taking into account regional areas probably yield more similar people, I would imagine the average couple would share more than two randomly chosen people on the planet.</p>
","<p>I will attempt to answer the question. Allele is defined, in simple terms, variation of a given gene, e.g. through deletions, SNPs etc. Humans are diploid organisms, meaning we have two sets of chromosomes, one from mother and one from father. Now since we have two sister chromosome, we can only have (share) two alleles of a given gene (one from mother and one from father) unless there are multiple copies of a gene or chromosome, which is mostly observed in disease conditions but that's not what we are talking about. Now since every humans have SNPs at roughly 1 every 1000 base pair, there are genetic variations between sequences of genes between humans, although there are some hot spots, which are more varied and some genes are very highly conserved due to their critical function such as cytochrome C. This just means that parents of the child you are describing (if not related to each other) are not likely to share the exact same, sequence wise, genetic code for a given gene selected at random.</p>

<p>The inheritance of a given allele of a gene on a chromosome happens through independent assortment (a process which happens maternally and paternally), meaning a child (offspring/zygote) would get one copy of a gene/allele (from the possible two that each parent themselves have) from maternal and one copy from paternal side at random. This is one source of genetic variation in a zygote. The other source of genetic variation is gene cross-over (through homologous recombination) meaning bits of the maternal or paternal chromosomes swap at gamete stage before the gametes are fused together to form a zygote, which makes the offspring unique and no offspring alike (except MZ twins but thats another discussion). This overall means that you can inherit a maximum of two alleles of a given gene (assuming again the parents of the child are not closely related) and even then the sequence of the offspring genes are not likely to be exactly the same as their parents, which makes every human unique. But saying that, you have a much higher gene sequence match to your parents than any other non-related human selected at random.</p>

<p>One thing worth noting here is that mitochondrial genes, are inherited exclusively from you mother (through the egg) and males inherit the Y chromosomes paternally so there are circumstances I guess you could say you inherit certain gene/alleles paternally or maternally.</p>

<p>What I speculate you might be thinking about is how many homologues (similar versions) of a given genes humans have and I think the average in the human genome is 3 but do check this! Flies (Drosophila) tends to have one, which is why its such a great model organism to study genetics and genetic interactions with as you do not tend to get redundancies.</p>

"How do people who have lost both of their legs produce red blood cells?","4653","","<p>As far as I know, just leg bones produce red blood cells. So, how people who lost their both legs produce red blood cells?</p>

<p>So you are partly right; the femur <em>is</em> associated with red blood cell production, or Erythropoiesis to give it it's technical name, <strong>but there are other bones within the human body that also do this job.</strong> The process of erythropoiesis is stimulated when the kidneys detect low levels of oxygen in the blood stream and stimulate production of the hormone erythropoietin.

<p>So I'd suggest it is unlikely that loss of the legs would have a major impact on the production of red blood cells in adults. I imagine that with the loss of legs comes some reduction in functionality of erythropoiesis but also a lower requirement of red blood cell production (less blood capacity = less blood cells needed = less blood cells need to be produced). I can't find any studies which explore the ability or needs of amputees and non-amputees with regards to red blood cell production.</p>

"Why is the neuronal plasma membrane more permeable to potassium ions than sodium ions?","4637","","<p>From what I understand, the greater permeability of the neuronal plasma membrane to K<sup>+</sup> ions (which diffuse out) than Na<sup>+</sup> ions (which diffuse in) helps to maintain the -60 mV resting membrane potential. However, I am not sure why. After all, K<sup>+</sup> ions are larger so should the membrane not be less permeable to them? Could it be to do with the greater charge density of Na<sup>+</sup> ions or is there another reason altogether? Does it have something to do with the 'leakiness' of ion channels?</p>

<p>Also, why is it that the resting potential is maintained and does not become increasingly more negative? Should it not be that because 3 Na<sup>+</sup> ions are pumped out and 2 K<sup>+</sup> are pumped in continuously, and more K<sup>+</sup> ions are diffusing out than Na<sup>+</sup> is diffusing in, that the potential is becoming increasingly negative? Is movement of other ions also involved in maintaining this potential?</p>
","<p>The <strong><a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cell-membranes-14052567"" rel=""nofollow"">cell membrane</a></strong> is inherently quite <strong>impermeable to any ion</strong>, because it is made of hydrophobic fatty acids. Ions are hydrophylic because of their charge and small size. Metal ions are relatively small and, indeed, have therefore a high charge density. They gather a lot of water around them and hence, they are hydrophylic. </p>

<p>Therefore ions, including Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> are transported via dedicated <strong><a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/ion-channels-and-excitable-cells-14406097"" rel=""nofollow"">ion channels</a></strong>, which form specialized pores in the membrane.

<p>There are indeed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_channel"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>leaky K<sup>+</sup> channels</strong></a>, but not leaky Na<sup>+</sup> channels.

"Why are some berries poisonous?","4629","","<p>In my understanding, the evolutional function of berries is to be eaten and pood out somewhere else, so that the seeds of the plant spread. Is this so? Then why are some berries poisonous?</p>
","<p>While poison affects not every organism equally, plants did develop some poisons to avoid being eaten. However, if you look at the great multitude of so-called secondary metabolites, most of them are poisonous to either viruses, bacteria, fungi or other microorganisms, or insects, or even other plants.

<p>So, if some substance from plants is a poison to us, it's accidentally so, and the target was another organism. Examples: nicotine is first and foremost an insecticide, nematistat, and herbicide; aconitine, atropine, caffeine are insecticides; many essential oils (causing allergies in human) are antimicrobial and so on.</p>

"Do human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes all the time?","4619","","<p>As far as I know, a human somatic cell has the cell cycle: </p>

<p>Interphase and Replication (mitosis). In interphase, the cell has 2 growth phases (G1 + G2) and a synthesis one (S phase being in between G1 and G2). After G2 ends, the cell will start entering mitosis.</p>

<p>Until the S phase, the cell has only 23 chromosomes right? And only after the DNA has duplicated the number of chromosomes doubles (to 46). </p>

<p>Please correct me if I am wrong? And will the cell in the G0 phase (after duplication and before G1) have 23 or 46 chromosomes? </p>
","<p>Humans have 46 chromosomes, 23 come from the mother and 23 come from the father. I think The easiest way to remember this is to think of the sex chromosomes--if you are male, you have one X chromosome from your mother and one Y chromosome from your father. During S-phase, the cell will make another copy of the X chromosome and the Y chromosome, so you will (technically) have 4 sex chromosomes in the cell before it divides, although you only have 2 UNIQUE sex chromosomes. After division, each daughter cell will have 2 sex chromosomes (one X and one Y). The same holds for all the other chromosomes.</p>

<p>So, to answer your question, yes, in G2 phase, you have double the amount of chromosomes in your cell (46*2 = 92), but you only have 46 UNIQUE chromosomes in your cell. </p>

<p>EDIT: As many people have pointed out, there are examples that do not conform to this rule. For example, both skeletal and liver cells can maintain a second copy of their chromosomes (making them 2n). This, however, is the exception. In my opinion, it's more valuable to know the basic rules that govern chromosomal number. </p>

<p>As an exercise I'd suggest to think about what it means that a cell has '2n' chromosomes? What happens if a germ cell obtains 2n chromosomes and passes that to a viable offspring? Is that offspring now '2n', or do they just have double the number of chromosomes as the parent? When does a duplicated chromosome become an it's own chromosome and not just a ""duplicate copy""? </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwQZj.jpg"" alt=""Dolphin""></p>

<p>Why is there this difference? Is it because it's mammals compared to fish? Or could fish as well have horizontal tail fins?</p>
","<p>While fish tend to move from side to side (lateral undulation) for which a vertical tail makes sense, the land ancestors of marine mammals had their limbs under them and so their spines were already adapted to up and down movement (dorsoventral undulation). When these animals moved to marine environments, they continued up and down movement in their swimming, for which a horizontal tail makes sense.</p>

<p>(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_fin#Evolution_of_fins"">The wikipedia article on fins</a> gives some more detail, and links to <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_03"">this webpage on Berkeley.edu</a>. A paper by <a href=""http://www.evolbiol.ru/large_files/whales.pdf"">Thewissen et al.</a> suggests that for cetaceans, dorsoventral undulation as a swimming strategy came first, and the horizontal tail evolved later.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>More detail:</strong></p>

<p>In a third example beyond fishes and marine mammals, the icthyosaurs and other aquatic reptiles developed vertical tails, even though like marine mammals they evolved from four-footed land animals. This may be because the legs/spines/gaits of land <em>reptiles</em> differ from those of land <em>mammals</em>, so that the earliest icthyosaurs swam with lateral undulation, <a href=""http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/motani/ichthyo/vert.html"">as reflected in their spinal modifications</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://laelaps.wordpress.com/2007/08/24/everyone-back-in-the-pool-from-artiodactyl-to-cetacean/"">This blog post</a> by Brian Switek gives a really superb run-down on the issue, with figures and citations. I'll quote this part which deals with the dorsoventral undulation theory:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...mammals and their relatives were carrying their legs underneath their bodies and not out to the sides since the late Permian, and so the motion of their spine adapted to move in an up-and-down motion rather than side-to-side like many living reptiles and amphibians. Thus Pakicetus[the pre-cetacean land mammal] would not have evolved a tail for side-to-side motion like icthyosaurs or sharks because they would have had to entirely change the way their spinal column was set up first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Switek goes on to to talk about exceptions in some marine mammals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At this point some of you might raise the point that living pinnipeds like seals and sea lions move in a side-to-side motion underwater. That may be true on a superficial level, but pinnipeds primarily use their modified limbs (hindlimbs in seals and forelimbs in sea lions) to move through the water; they aren’t relying on propulsion from a large fluke or caudal fin providing most of the propulsion with the front fins/limbs providing lift and allowing for change in direction. <em>This diversity of strategies in living marine mammals suggests differing situations encountered by differing ancestors with their own suites of characteristics, but in the case of whales it seems that their ancestors were best fitted to move by undulating their spinal column and using their limbs to provide some extra propulsion/direction.</em></p>

"What determines whether an action potential is inhibitory or excitatory?","4604","","<p>What determines whether an action potential is inhibitory or excitatory? Is it determined by the receptors, the neurotransmitters, or some other mechanism? </p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
The physiological state of the postsynaptic cell ultimately determines the effect of an incoming action potential.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
An action potential occurring in a chemical synapse is neither inhibitory or excitatory. An action potential is a binary '1', an-all-or-nothing signal without any information, i.e., there is not a -1 or +1 action potential. Similarly, there are no excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters. </p>

<p>Notably, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, glutamate, can have inhibitory effects dependent on the receptor activated. While most metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and ionotropic AMPA and NMDA receptors are indeed all excitatory, the inhibitory glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are not <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8938647"" rel=""nofollow"">(Cleland, 1996)</a>. </p>

<p>Conversely, GABA, the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, can have excitatory postsynaptic effects. For example, hyperpolarized neurons may actually depolarize upon GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activation, simply because the resting membrane potential is more negative than the reversal potential of Cl<sup>-</sup> (i.e., Cl<sup>-</sup> flows <em>out</em> of the cell due to the negative membrane potential) <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15927683"" rel=""nofollow"">(Marty &amp; Liano, 2005)</a>.  </p>

<p>The existence of both excitatory and inhibitory glutamate receptors shows that it is the <strong>postsynaptic receptor</strong> that determines whether an action potential will inhibit or excite the postsynaptic neuron. The excitatory effect of GABA<sub>A</sub> activation shows that on top of that, even principal inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA) with principal inhibitory receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>) can excite a neuron dependent on its <strong>physiological state</strong>.    </p>

<p>Besides chemical synapses there are electrical synapses. In these synapses action potentials are transmitted directly electrically through gap junctions. In this case, <em>any action potential</em> is excitatory as the signal will be carried forward if it is strong enough <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11164/"" rel=""nofollow"">(Purves e<em>t al</em>., 2001)</a>.  </p>

Allolactose and other analogues can then bind LacI to induce the appropriate conformational change and unbind the <em>lac</em> operator (one such <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23011886"" rel=""nofollow"">review</a> here).</p>

<p>Why does allolactose act as a signal of lactose presence instead of just lactose? From the perspective of the lac operon, there is no operational difference between lactose and allolactose -- either way one molecule binds LacI and cannot be metabolized while bound. The full paradox is explained by <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3072716"" rel=""nofollow"">Edgel</a> and summarized by well-known biochemistry textbook author and scientist, Larry Moran, on his <a href=""http://sandwalk.blogspot.ca/2008/10/lactose-paradox.html"" rel=""nofollow"">personal blog</a>. The short version is that neither allolactose nor lactose are the intended substrates for $\beta$-gal and instead a different sugar entirely is the ""natural"" inducer and substrate.</p>

"Why does the apex of the human heart usually point to the left?","4561","","<p>In the majority of human beings, the apex of the heart (left ventricle) points towards the left side of the body.  Sometimes however (approx. 1/12000 births), a person is born with a condition known as ""Dextrocardia"", in which the apex of the heart points to the right side of the body instead.</p>

<p>Is there an evolutionary reason as to why the human heart usually points to the left side as opposed to the right side of the body?</p>

<p>(Note:  Please don't answer with, ""because there is a notch in the left lung"", because I will simply reply with, ""is there an evolutionary reason for the apex of the heart AND the cardiac notch being on the left as opposed to the right side of the body"").</p>
","<p>From a quick look at the paper @ChinmayKanchi links to (<a href=""https://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5697/828.full"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Palmer. 2004. Symmetry Breaking and the Evolution of Development. Science 306"">Palmer, 2004</a>) it seems that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All living vertebrates possess a heart that is conspicuously asymmetrical and normally displaced toward the left (<a href=""http://dev.biologists.org/content/124/11/2099.abstract?ijkey=98ffa089b81e8ed19fd71a9f7d8a9521e2a20e18&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Fishman &amp; Chien. 1997. Fashioning the vertebrate heart: earliest embryonic decisions. Development 124: 2099-2117."">Fishman &amp; Chien, 1997</a>). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the heart orientation seems to be evolutionary conserved in vertebrates (as are many fundamental traits), and no specific explanation is needed for humans. </p>

<p>This is said with the reservation that human anatomy is not my subject field, and the refered paper also digs deeper into the molecular basis for the orientation/symmetry of organisms. For instance, it also says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, the molecular pathway directing hearts leftward—the nodal cascade—varies considerably among vertebrates (homology of form does not require homology of development) and was possibly co-opted from a preexisting asymmetrical chordate organ system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so the molecular mechanisms governing this seems to differ between species. This <em>could</em> indicate that there is a selective pressure molding species into the same heart orientation. This is pure speculation on my part though.</p>

<p>I also want to mention that evolutionary outcomes doesn't have to have a ""reason"" (i.e. a selective advantage). Much depends on chance events and evolution can only act on what is present at the moment (i.e. is restricted by earlier evolutionary history).</p>

"What does it mean to have a Y-DNA Haplogroup ""R-M512""?","4559","","<p>I did a DNA test to learn about my origins, but the results are highly technical.</p>

<p>I see I have a Y-DNA Haplogroup R-M512 and a mutation (zero marker in DYS448). I Googled these terms and came across a bunch of technical papers, but I don't have the expertise in Genetics to make much sense of them. </p>

<p>I wonder if one of you can shed light on this?</p>
","<p>Normally Humans inherit from each parent one sex determine Chromosome. If you have a XX chromosome pair you are female. If you have a XY pair you are male. Therefore the Y-Chromosome get only passed on from father to son. The Chromosomes itself consist of DNA. The DNA consists of base pairs in which an A only pairs with a T and a C only pairs with a G. The Y-Chromosome has about 57 million of these base pairs. DNA is normally relative stable but from time to time only one of these base pairs randomly changes from a C-G base pair to an A-T base pair. This phenomenon is called a pointmutation. So imagen two brothers. One has the unchanged Y-Chromosome of their father the other has one this pointmutations. So the descendants of the one Brother have the same Y-Chromosome, with exception of the pointmutation, the same Y-Chromosome. This is called a Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP). In the millennia the Y-Chromosomes acquire more and more of these SNPs. One combination of these SNPs is called a Haplogroup. By the amount of SNPs and the kind of them you can reconstruct which Haplogroup descended from which one. You have the Haplogroup R-M512 which is a rather old one (<a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/R1a._Info-19.05.2014.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/R1a._Info-19.05.2014.jpg</a>) and could be found in great area. M512 is actually the name of the last SNP that defines your Haplogroup. Here some people had write down which Haplogroup they belong to. By the ethnicity of the name you can assume how far it is spread ( <a href=""https://www.familytreedna.com/public/R1a?iframe=ysnp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.familytreedna.com/public/R1a?iframe=ysnp</a> ).

"What is the difference between cytosol and cytoplasm?","4558","","<p>I've generally seen <strong>cytosol</strong> defined as <em>the solution inside cells minus  the organelles, cytoskeleton, etc</em> and <strong>cytoplasm</strong> as <em>the cytosol plus the organelles, cytoskeleton, etc</em>. This naturally leads to the impression that cytosol is the cytoplasm minus all the solids. The problem here is that there are all sorts of other large molecules in the cells which could be thought of as solid. Are they also part of the cytosol or are they suspended in it? (I.e. are they part of the cytosol or are they non-cytosol components of the cytoplasm?)</p>

<p>Basically, I'm asking if the precise definition of cytosol is just <em>anything in the cell that's not behind an endomembrane (save the exoskeleton)</em> or if the dividing line is something else.</p>

<p><em>Subquestion: things can get even more terminologically confused because the cytosol is sometimes called the matrix. What the heck is the preferred terminology with this stuff?</em></p>
","<p>IMO, the definitive answer to this question is given in a <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0968000483900270"" rel=""noreferrer"">paper</a> by J. S Clegg.  He traced the origin of the term <em>cytosol</em> to a book chapter by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_A._Lardy"" rel=""noreferrer"">H. A. Lardy</a>, and confirmed by email that Lardy had indeed coined the term. Their definition of <strong>cytosol</strong> is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... that portion of the cell which is found in the supernatant fraction after centrifuging the homogenate at 105 000 x g for 1 hour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus <em>cytosol</em> is a centrifugation term, (ie a fraction obtained by centrifugation)  and  ' should not be applied, in any context, to the intact cell' (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0968000483900270"" rel=""noreferrer"">Clegg, 1983</a>). </p>

<p>The cytosol  may roughly be though of as the 'soluble' portion of the cellular extract obtained after everything else, including the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsome"" rel=""noreferrer"">microsomes</a>, have been sedimented. (For those not familiar with subcellular frationation, centrifugation at 100 000 g for 1 hr is the 'standard' method of sedimenting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsome"" rel=""noreferrer"">microsomes</a>. If your enzyme is found in the 100 000 g supernatant fraction, you can be  pretty sure it is soluble). </p>

<p>When we are referring to the <em>cellular</em> aqueous fluid  that 'holds'   the organelles and other  components we should use the term <strong>cytoplasm</strong>. </p>

<p>At the bottom of Clegg's article, the editors of TIBS have supplied the following quote, attributed to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick"" rel=""noreferrer"">F.H.C Crick</a> &amp; A. F. W Hughes (1950): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we were compelled to suggest a model for the structure of cytoplasm we would propose Mother's Work Basket -a jumble of threads, beads and buttons of all shapes and sizes, with pins and threads for good measure, all jostling about and held together by ""colloidal forces"".'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In being a  centrifugation fraction,  the term  'cytosol' is very like  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsome"" rel=""noreferrer"">microsome</a>: the intact cell contains neither cytosol or microsome.  </p>

","<p>The capture area of the eye is a bit fuzzier and harder to define than that of a camera.</p>

<p>A camera captures consistent, fully detailed data right up to the edge of its sensor, and no data at all beyond it. Captured data is clipped by an ideally uniform sensor, augmented a bit by the lens, and is well-defined during design and manufacturing.</p>

<p>The eye can capture higher ""resolution"" near the center of its capture area and also has very little information about color near the edges (see also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vision"" rel=""noreferrer"">Peripheral Vision</a>); so it's not quite as clean cut depending on your goal of ""capture area"". The eye also has a bit of a ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision)"" rel=""noreferrer"">blind spot</a>"" near the middle, which our brains basically Photoshop out. Additionally, it varies from person to person. </p>

<p>The <em>effective</em> capture area would really depend on your application (e.g. the ""capture area"" for, say, reading text, would be narrower than the area for, say, detecting motion).</p>

<p>Here is a typical diagram for a single eye, showing just the ability to see something in that area (does not show details related to peripheral vision quality):</p>

If you want the detailed answer to your question and more, you probably want to take a look at that.</p>

<p>Note that our field of vision is very wide, those diagrams may not do it justice. As an experiment, close one eye, stare straight ahead and hold your arms straight out to the sides. Wiggle your fingers and slowly bring your arms forward until you can just see your wiggling fingers in your peripheral vision, and you will get an idea. As an added experiment, hold a piece of paper with text on it, and repeat the same experiment until you can read the text - this region will be extremely narrow and will give you an idea of how the quality of vision changes across the field. Also try with a colored object and bring it in until you can clearly identify the color.</p>

It is pretty obvious to me how evolution would select some minor traits like size, resistnce to illness or climate. There is a mutation where some organisms are slightly different and better traits are selected. However I cannot imagine how an organism will mutate to have lets say lungs at once and unless organism has a functional organ there is no reason for the trait to be selected. So how does evolution produce complx organs?</p>
","<p>The best introduction to evolution of complex phenotypes via master control genes is <em>Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo and the Making of the Animal Kingdom</em> by Sean B. Carroll. You might also want to have a look at a more recent Evolutional developmental biology (Evo Devo) book like those you get when searching for ""Evo Devo"" in Google Books.</p>

<p>In summary, it is possible for a mutation to change a shape by changing the spatial distribution of a transcription factor during embryo development. What's more, by changing the distribution of two mutually dependent factors, formation of any shape is possible if the distributions overlap. Such transcription factors are highly conserved in evolution and the most important cause of the endless forms we see.</p>

<p>Does it mean that when constructing the cDNA, we always use the ones with a A's tail? Then other RNAs like tRNA are filtered and not used to get their cDNA? I do find some RNAs records on UCSC where microRNAs are included.</p>

","<p>One of the primary reasons to use poly(A) selection is to eliminate the massive amount of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) present in the samples.  The alternative is to use ribosomal RNA depletion kits / techniques to remove as much rRNA as possible before sequencing.  Without rRNA depletion a large proportion (~60-80%) of the reads would map to rRNAs.</p>

"How many times did terrestrial life emerge from the ocean?","4526","","<p>Evolution is often mistakenly depicted as linear in popular culture.

<p>Of course, this showcases only <em>one</em> ancestral lineage for <em>one</em> specific species (<em>Homo sapiens</em>). My question is: <strong>Where else did life evolve out of water onto land?</strong></p>

<p>Intuitively, this seems like a huge leap to take (adapting to a fundamentally alien environment) but it still must have happend several times (separately at least for plants, insects and chordates, since their respective most recent common ancestor is sea-dwelling). In fact, the more I think of it the more examples I find.</p>

<p>I doubt we know the precise number, or even anywhere near it. But there are several well-supported theorised colonisations which might interest you and help to build up a picture of just how common it was for life to transition to land. We can also use known facts about when different evolutionary lineages diverged, along with knowledge about the earlier colonisations of land, to work some events out for ourselves. I've done it here for broad taxonomic clades at different scales - if interested you could do the same thing again for lower sub-clades.</p>

<p><strong>Bacterial and archaean colonisation</strong><br>
The first evidence of life on land seems to originate from 2.6 (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6812/full/408574a0.html"">Watanabe et al., 2000</a>) to 3.1 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC533871/"">Battistuzzi et al., 2004</a>) billion years ago. Since molecular evidence points to bacteria and archaea diverging between 3.2-3.8 billion years ago (<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/94/24/13028.full"">Feng et al.,1997</a> - a classic paper), and since both bacteria and archaea are found on land (e.g. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20204349"">Taketani &amp; Tsai, 2010</a>), they must have colonised land independently. I would suggest there would have been many different bacterial colonisations, too. One at least is certain - cyanobacteria must have colonised independently from some other forms, since they evolved after the first bacterial colonisation (Tomitani et al., 2006), and are now found on land, e.g. in lichens.</p>

<p><strong>Protistan, fungal, algal, plant and animal colonisation</strong><br>
Protists are a polyphyletic group of simple eukaryotes, and since fungal divergence from them (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1689654/"">Wang et al., 1999</a> - another classic) predates fungal emergence from the ocean (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034666795000860"">Taylor &amp; Osborn, 1996</a>), they must have emerged separately. Then, since plants and fungi diverged whilst fungi were still in the ocean (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1689654/"">Wang et al., 1999</a>), plants must have colonised separately. Actually, it has been explicitly discovered in various ways (e.g. molecular clock methods, <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/293/5532/1129.short"">Heckman et al., 2001</a>) that plants must have left the ocean separately to fungi, but probably relied upon them to be able to do it (<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00397.x/full"">Brundrett, 2002</a> - see note at bottom about this paper). Next, simple animals... Arthropods colonised the land independently (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC333434/"">Pisani et al, 2004</a>), and since nematodes diverged before arthropods (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1689654/"">Wang et al., 1999</a>), they too must have independently found land. Then, lumbering along at the end, came the tetrapods (<a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/10.1086/425183"">Long &amp; Gordon, 2004</a>).</p>

"Why is a mosquito feeding on human blood not a parasite?","4512","","<p>I recently read in my Ecology course notes that a mosquito feeding on human blood is not considered as a parasite. However, since it sucks blood from the human body, shouldn't it be regarded as a parasite, just like lice and ticks?</p>
","<p><strong>A mosquito is a biological parasite, it is not a medical parasite.</strong> </p>

<p>There are two definitions of parasite. A biological/ecological definition and a medical/physiological interaction definition.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>parasite in biological terms</strong> is an organism that benefits from a parasitic relationship; a parasitic relationship being a non-mutual relationship between species, in which one species benefits at the expense of the other. Generally the host is not killed by a small number of parasites. When the host is killed the organism is usually called predator or parasitoid. </p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>parasite in medical terms</strong> is an organism that lives on or in a host and gets food from or at the expense of its host. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The difference is small but important; only the medical definition requires the parasite to live in or on the host for prolonged periods. It is a much narrower definition.</p>

<p>Biologically, a female mosquito is an indirect ectoparasite, it can be facultative or obligate depending on the species. It harms its host to benefit itself, that is all that is needed to be a parasite by the biological/ecological definition. And just like a leech or vampire bat it is hemophagic and leaves the host as soon as it is done feeding. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brood parasites</a> are another great example of a biological parasite that does not live on or in the host. So a cuckoo would be a biological parasite but not a medical parasite. When you consider the function and practice of medical science the more narrow definition makes sense, they are not concerned with parasites that are not going to stick around or not affect the host organism's physiology directly. By the narrower medical definition, none of these organisms are parasites even though by the biological/ecological definition they are. </p>

<p>Consider the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki</a> or a paper on <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4413784/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">parasite evolution</a> vs say the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CDC</a> to see the difference.</p>

","<p>When our skin is exposed to the sun, this can cause some damage in the upper layers of skin. This activates DNA damage repair and also induces signalling towards the melanocytes (which produce the pigment). Signalling means the excretion of signalling molecules (mostly alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone, aMSH) which binds to the MC1R receptor (melanocortin 1 receptor) on the surface of the melanocyte (the cell which produces the pigment) and induces (or increases) the production of melanin. The melanin is then transferred in the melanosomes to the adjacent keratinocytes, which are then better protected from the sun. This figure (from this <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25414302"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a>) illustrates this process nicely:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JFkDo.jpg"" alt=""diagram of UV effects on the cellular level""></p>

<p>Short term tans (the fast reaction) are based on the changed distribution of melanosomes (granules containing pigment) from the melanocytes to keratinocytes. Longer term suntans are caused by increased pigmentation in the skin as a reaction to the UV exposure by the accumulation of melanin and by the burning of cells. So it is no wonder that it looks like increased pigmentation, it really is. People tan differently because of their genetic background. This influences their ability to react to sun exposure.</p>

<p>There is relatively little known about the degradation of the melanosomes (the granules containing the melanin). What is known is that they are degraded in the lysosome, and that the melanin is most likely degraded through oxidation. There happens to be a permanent turnover of the melanosomes, and when the body is producing fewer new melanosomes than are degraded, your skin will get lighter again.</p>

<p>As with all reactions this is dependent of the concentration of the molecules

<blockquote>
  <p>The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) due to ATP hydrolysis depends upon
  the concentrations of the various participants in the reaction. When
  the concentrations are farther from their equilibrium values, the
  absolute value of ΔG is greater. Under “standard” conditions (i.e.
  concentrations of 1M for all reactants except water which is taken at
  its characteristic concentration of 55M) the Gibbs free energy of ATP
  hydrolysis varies from -28 to -34 kJ/mol (i.e. ≈12 kBT, BNID 101989)
  depending on the concentration of the cation Mg2+. The dependence on
  Mg ions occurs because the positively-charged magnesium ions help to
  stabilize the ATP molecule. However, in the cell the conditions are
  never even close to the standard state values. (<a href=""http://book.bionumbers.org/how-much-energy-is-released-in-atp-hydrolysis/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</p>

","<p>If I understand the nomenclature correctly, an R plasmid is just any plasmid containing an antibiotic (<strong>R</strong>)esistance gene (eg. Amp, Kan, Cm, etc.). It's a bit of an outdated name from when people didn't know how exactly the plasmids conferred such resistance.</p>

<p>An F-plasmid is any plasmid that contains the genes necessary for (<strong>F</strong>)ertility, eg:horizontal gene transfer via the <em>tra</em> operon.</p>

<p>The two do not have to appear together -- eg: Many F plamids will contain resistance genes (along with other random chunks from the genome), but resistance doesn't always have to be part of the payload. Likewise, it is common in labs to build pure resistance vectors that lack any horizontal transfer capability in order to select for particular clones.</p>

"Does coloring affect the perception of depth?","4488","","<p>I have a question about the mechanics of human vision which may be as much of a physics question as it is a biology/physiology question. I noticed that if I try to imagine a clear blue daytime sky contrasted with a clear night sky and ask myself which of the two appears closer, my intuition says the daytime sky appears closer. My next thought was, given that a night sky is mostly black, visually the only difference between the two skies is their color. So why is that I want to ""blue"" is closer than ""black""? And if the difference in color is truly what produces the difference in perceived depth, can similar effects be noticed with other color pairs at more familiar distance scales?</p>

<p>But then again, there are a couple of alternative explanations that seem more plausible to me on second thought. A black night sky could just as easily be called a dark sky, and the difference in perceived depth is really more a matter of shading. Then I remembered a night sky has stars of course, and it might be that my mind just wants to place the stars at normal ""sky depth"", forcing the black backdrop to appear even further away.</p>

<p>(Another related question I've been somewhat curious about: what precisely is the perceived ""distance to the sky"" as far as our intuitions are concerned?)</p>
","<p>Yes, color and shading can certainly affect depth perception, as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">explained by wikipedia:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Aerial perspective</em> – Due to light scattering by the atmosphere, <strong>objects that are a great distance away have lower luminance contrast and lower color saturation.</strong> Due to this, images seem blurry the farther they are away from a person's point of view. In computer graphics, this is often called ""distance fog."" The foreground has high contrast; the background has low contrast. <strong>Objects differing only in their contrast with a background appear to be at different depths. The color of distant objects are also shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum (e.g., distant mountains).</strong> Some painters, notably Cézanne, employ ""warm"" pigments (red, yellow and orange) to bring features forward towards the viewer, and ""cool"" ones (blue, violet, and blue-green) to indicate the part of a form that curves away from the picture plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JgT9f.jpg"" alt=""Manet&#39;s &quot;Luncheon on the Grass&quot;""></p>

<p>The above is Manet's ""Luncheon on the Grass"" - and if you look at it briefly it seems the bathing woman is sort of hovering amidst the trio instead of rinsing herself off in the background. This is because the warmer colors flanked by more saturated greens in the grass around her ""pull"" her forward into the same space as the rest of the painting. Here, scale is one of the major cues that she should be in the background.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5W60c.jpg"" alt=""Cezanne&#39;s &quot;The Bay&quot;""></p>

<p>Above is Cezanne's ""The Bay"" and is an excellent example of how warmer colors (reds, yellows, oranges) are used to add depth when contrasted with cool colors (blues, greens, violets). The image works very well, and that's partially because of the colors chosen. You can almost draw a diagonal line between the warm and cool portions of the painting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I noticed that if I try to imagine a clear blue daytime sky contrasted with a clear night sky and ask myself which of the two appears closer, my intuition says the daytime sky appears closer.

</blockquote>

<p>Well, there are many differences between the two! The daytime sky has numerous reference points - the horizon, mountains, clouds, airplanes, nearby buildings, etc. I would bet the reference points are the number one reason you perceive the daytime sky to be closer, as our brain is constantly taking them into account without us thinking about it. There are other cues, too: The daytime sky has a gradient to it - that is, the blue of the sky differs due to the curve of the atmosphere, and gradients increase depth perception with more saturated colors being perceived as closer (as opposed to the edges of the daytime sky, which are often less saturated). </p>

<p>The night sky, on the other hand, is pretty much solid black (<em>if you live in suburban or urban areas</em>). The lack of a gradient or other colors immediately robs the observer of some depth perception, and because of the inky blackness of night the other reference points - the horizon, nearby structures, airplanes, clouds, etc. - can practically disappear, robbing the observer of additional depth perception.</p>

","<p>That might be a good experiment.</p>

<p>I know that before planting bulbs you want to put them in the refrigerator or even the freezer sometimes.  </p>

<p>To paraphrase: some seeds become inactivated at higher temperatures like lettuce and delphinium.  You can place the seeds in medium and put them in the fridge or freezer for a day or two. </p>

<p>You can see how this makes sense.  The seeds have adapted to start growing when they are freezing because the timing results in the plants breaking ground as early as possible when the temperature is warm enough in the spring. </p>

<p>A quick search doesn't seem to imply that silverbeet needs to be stratified before planting.  The result might be negative, but there is definitely some good expectation that it makes a difference to some plants. </p>

"How can heart disease cause excessive sweating?","4462","","<p>According to google:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What can cause sudden sweating?</p>
  
  <p>Excessive Sweating. A person with
  excessive sweating has a condition called hyperhidrosis. ... In
  adults, the most common cause of hyperhidrosis is emotional stress.
  However, excessive sweating is also caused by heart disease, lung
  disease, diabetes, and shock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sweating is seemingly unrelated to the heart conditions. By what mechanism can a heart disease cause excessive sweating?</p>
","<p>The answer lies in <em>compensation</em>. Take myocardial infarction, for starters. MI, if large enough, severely weakens the heart, and hence, at the same level of stimulation, it can no longer pump blood effectively, causing what is called Heart Failure (inability to pump <em>enough</em> blood). This causes an excess stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (or more technically, <em>neurohumoral mechanisms</em>) in an attempt to compensate, which by its effects on heart contractility and rate increases the amount of pumped blood to match the need. This sympathetic outflow also causes increased sweating, nervousness, dry mouth etc. Sweating, nervousness are cardinal signs of acute MI.</p>

<p>Additional point: This compensation can only work in certain cases, say for example where the heart failure is due to blood loss with a healthy heart. But in cases like MI, this compensation is not an optimal response, rather it worsens the case, since increasing the workload on an ischaemic heart (ischaemic levels of atherosclerosis being the commonest cause of MI), further damages the wall leading to chronic heart failure and disease. This is the <strong>Broken Compensation Model</strong> for chronic heart failure. This is why we use <strong>Beta Blockers</strong> to abrogate the sympathetic system's (or more technically, the neurohumoral mechanisms') unwanted compensatory efforts, and the observed efficacy and increased longevity substantiates the validity of the model. </p>

<p>References:</p>

<p>I added them in a bit of a haste. They might not be the best references available, but they are considerably credible. Pathophysiology of heart failure, ventricular remodelling and the involved neurohumoral mechanisms are well-studied, and you shall get several papers on it on pubmed or google scholar.</p>

"What limits the speed of human perception?","4462","","<p>I'm writing a novel in which the main character's perception and thought processes are sped up considerably, in essence slowing down the world around him. To others, it seems like his reactions are far faster than normal. Of course, there's a fantasy explanation for this in the story, but it led me to wonder exactly what limits the speed of human perception and reasoning in the real world.</p>

<p>From what I know, the speed at which we perceive events appears to be a constant. What exactly determines that rate? Is it possible to change it? Is it possible that different people perceive things at different speeds?</p>
","<h2><strong>Flicker Fusion Threshold:</strong></h2>

<p>The wikipedia definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It is defined as the frequency at which an intermittent light stimulus appears to be completely steady to the average human observer.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In 1824, <strong>Peter Mark Roget</strong> (who also wrote the famous Thesaurus) first presented the concept of ""<strong>persistence of vision</strong>"" to the Royal Society of London, as the ability of the retina to retain an image of an object for $\frac{1}{20}$ to $\frac{1}{5}$ second after its removal from the field of vision. </p>

<p>A second principle - the <strong>$\phi\ phenomenon$ or stroboscopic effect</strong> is closely related to flicker fusion. It was first studied by <strong>Max Wertheimer and Hugo Munsterberg</strong> between 1912-16. Wertheimer and Munsterberg found that subjects can perceptually bridge the temporal gap between two consecutive displays, so that a series of static images appear as continuous movement. The discovery of flicker fusion became the perceptual basis for moving pictures, television, and all media based on stroboscopic presentation of stimuli.</p>

<p><strong>The minimal frequency at which flickering stimuli appear continuous is called the critical flicker frequency.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Perceptual factors affecting the critical flicker fusion threshold</strong></h2>

<p>This critical flicker fusion threshold depends on the stimulus’ </p>

<ul>
<li>Luminance (the Ferry-Porter law), </li>
<li>Size (the Granit-Harper law), </li>
<li>Color, </li>
<li>Retinal eccentricity, </li>
<li>Background Luminance, and other factors.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Biology Behind it:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Physiological evidence in humans and monkeys shows that flicker rates
  above the perceptual critical flicker frequency threshold can
  nevertheless generate cortical and subcortical visual responses.  Thus
  the temporal integration underlying flicker fusion does not occur at
  the level of the retina,  but must take place later in the visual
  hierarchy. Single-unit recordings in the primary visual cortex of
  primates suggests that,  for two brief-duration targets presented in
  close succession, the after-discharge to the first  target interferes
  with the onset-response to the second target (Macknik, 2006) (see
  Figure 5). The onset-response to the second flash is absent for
  inter-stimuli intervals of 30 msec or shorter (equivalent to 17 Hz
  periodic). If the flashes are separated by more than 30 ms, the
  after-discharge to the first flash and the onset-response to the
  second flash begin to recover (i.e. equivalent to &lt;17 Hz flicker).
  These intervals roughly coincide with the critical flicker fusion
  threshold in humans for 100% contrast stimuli in the fovea .</p>
  
  <p>This suggests that perceptual flicker fusion may be due to the lack of
  robust transient responses to the flickering stimulus.</p>

<h2>What is the Different speeds of Visual Perception?</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDfBg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>First-order motion</h2>

<p><strong>Experiment:</strong> A moving sinusoidal grating with bright peaks and dark troughs is seen through a window. </p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Even when its velocity is so high that 30 of its bright peaks pass each location per second (30 Hz), observers still perceive its direction of
motion. </p>

<p><img src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ydDJlxvKQlI/TCDIhHpmC4I/AAAAAAAAAEM/ULxcFAt1d1o/s1600/Sinusoid.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<h2>Depth from binocular disparity</h2>

<p><strong>Experiment:</strong> Two identical gratings, one in each eye, are viewed through identical windows. </p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> One is spatially shifted relative to the other, introducing a binocular disparity that is perceived as depth. 
Even when they move at a 30 Hz rate, the depth is still perceived. 
If the input to depth mechanisms were blurred at a >30 ms timescale, detecting the depth would be impossible at this rate.</p>

<h2>Edges and texture boundaries</h2>

<p><strong>Experiment:</strong> Against a gray background, a field of white dots is adjacent to a field of black dots. </p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Both fields are set in rapid alternation between white and black, but out of phase – when
one is white, the other is black. The conspicuous boundary between them is perceived even at fast 
rates of 30 Hz, whereas at faster rates the black and white are averaged by the brain into the same color as the background.</p>

<h2>Binding of color and orientation sharing a spatial location</h2>

<p>Experiment &amp; Result: If a red, right-tilted patch is alternated with a green, left tilted patch, 
it is easy to distinguish from the complementary pairing of red left alternating with green right, even at
fast 20 Hz rates.</p>

<h2>Binding of form and color across space</h2>

<p>Alternating color-shape pairings can only be reported at rates below ~3 Hz.</p>

<h2>Binding of global form with color</h2>

<p>Two specially constructed dot patterns that form distinct shapes alternate, with all the dots of one red and all the
dots of the other green. </p>

<p>At alternation rates faster than several a second it is very difficult to determine the shape color pairing even though the shapes and colors themselves
are easily identified.</p>

<h2>Direction change and acceleration perception</h2>

<p>A moving stimulus alternates between two speeds (acceleration) or two directions. When the alternation occurs
faster than several per second, these changes are unperceivable.
Its limit is 8-10 Hz.</p>

<h2>Word perception</h2>

<p>Certain pairs of words (such as ‘jump’ and ‘pink’), when alternated in the same location, cannot be distinguished
from another matched pair at rapid rates as one perceives only the sum, which is the same for both pairs. 
They can be distinguished only at rates slower than several items per second.</p>

"How does most of lymph get back into the blood stream? (I don't mean the lymphatic system)","4450","","<p>I once read that it was because of osmotic pressure that it returns to the blood stream, by entering the venules. But why? If lymph originated as plasma how come that the solute concentration is higher in the venule? Doesn't plasma contain solutes such as salts, nutrients, oxygen, etc. ?</p>
","<p>Technically 'lymph' is used to refer to the fluid found within the lymphatic system. If it's not in the lymphatic system, it is not lymph fluid. Thus, your question is really asking about interstitial fluid or the plasma that was filtered out of blood capillaries.</p>

<p>The answer to your question is based on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling_equation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Starling equation</a>. Normally fluid leaves a capillary due to a net pressure that favors the interstitium. This net pressure is based on the hydrostatic pressure within the capillary being greater than the interstitial pressure of the surrounding tissues, and the oncotic pressure of the capillary (that draws fluid in) being weaker than the hydrostatic pressure of the capillary (that pushes fluid out). At the venule end of this system, the capillary oncotic pressure is stronger than the capillary hydrostatic pressure, drawing fluid back into the circulatory system.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4irFO.png"" alt=""Filtration in Systemic Capillaries""></p>

<p>Remember that albumin is the most important component which establishes the oncotic pressure within a vessel, and that this protein is normally NOT released out of a vessel during filtration. Thus, it passes from the capillary into its corresponding venule directly.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/z3MBy.jpg"" alt=""Microcirculation""></p>

<p>Yes, plasma that enters the interstitium contains many of the same components as when it is in the blood, but the main difference is the protein content, losing the majority of proteins as it enters the interstitium. </p>

<p>Now, if you are asking how the majority of LYMPH fluid re-enters the blood stream, the answer is through the R lymphatic and L lymphatic (aka thoracic) ducts, at the location of the R subclavian or R internal jugular, and L subclavian veins, respectively. Once fluid enters lymphatic capillaries, it goes through a system of lymphatic vessels, trunks, and finally, the above mentioned ducts to rejoin blood. </p>

"How do I clean and calibrate pipettes, and how often should I do it?","4449","","<p>I work in a lab where all the pipettes are shared. We often have visiting students who come and use the pipettes for a short project. So when I work with them, they might have been handled by other people several times since I last used them. This leads me to worry that they might have been mishandled, or become less accurate somehow.</p>

<p>How do I clean and calibrate pipettes? And how often do I need to do it?</p>
","<p>How often you should calibrate your pipettes depends on the tolerances of your application. For some applications, like quantitative PCR setup, one may care a great deal; for general lab work, one can probably be less particular. You can get a sense of how accurate your pipettes are by pipetting DI water onto the platform of a sensitive (and calibrated!) balance. Comparing the random and systemic error you get while doing that over several trials to the specifications published by the manufacturer will give you a good idea of whether pipette calibration will help and help give you a sense of how much you care. Note also that the error may vary with the volume; you should test error over the entire volume range you intend to use the pipette for.</p>

<p>How to clean and calibrate pipettes is specific to each design. Some pipettes, like Gilson's, are not intended to be calibrated by the user. Others are. The pipette user guide published by the manufacturer should tell you.</p>

<p>For some demanding applications, even well-calibrated and well-handled micropipettes may not be sufficiently accurate. In particular, I've made standard curves by serial 10-fold dilution for quantitative PCR both a) relying on my micropipettors to be correct and b) trusting pipettes only to get me into the right ballpark, and intentionally undershooting and correcting volumes with sequentially smaller pipettes until the reading on the balance is correct, if that's at all clear. In both cases I was using 900 ul of diluent and 100 ul of the previous dilution, which I feel are comfortably large volumes to handle. I found that the latter curve gave me noticeably better regressions.</p>

"What does it mean to ""write an image and GIF into the DNA of bacteria""?","4448","","<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40585299"" rel=""noreferrer"">BBC News recently published an article</a> saying that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An image and short film has been encoded in DNA, using the units of inheritance as a medium for storing information ...
  The team sequenced the bacterial DNA to retrieve the gif and the image, verifying that the microbes had indeed incorporated the data as intended.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uG4SB.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uG4SB.jpg"" alt=""This is the image:""></a></p>

<p>The news article shows an image of a hand (shown above) and a short film (not shown here) of a horse rider that was encoded into the DNA <em>""using a genome editing tool known as Crispr [sic]""</em>.  </p>

<p>My question is, what does this mean? Did the scientists break down an image into 0's and 1's and (install?) it into bacteria?  How does a scientist (download?) an image into bacteria and then (redownload?) the image later?  How does DNA hold information of a picture that can be (downloaded)?</p>
","<p>Just to add what might have been missing in the beautiful answer by @iayork. I just want to give a more simple picture of the encoding done in the <em>E. coli</em> DNA.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First for the <strong>rigid strategy</strong> in which 4 pixel colors were each specified by a different base, suppose we have a sequence:</p>

<p>AAGCCCTGGTCAGCT</p>

<p>Ignore the first AAG and start with C. Now, each base of DNA can represent a 2-digit binary number, and each number then corresponds to a color, like:</p>

<p>C = 00</p>

<p>T = 01</p>

<p>A = 10</p>

<p>G = 11</p>

<p>With this strategy in mind, the sequence CCCT would give 00000001 pixet (or pixel set), and so on as the sequence grows. This pixet would define the color of four pixels in the image. Thus, each base corresponds to a pixel in the image, and the base defines the color of the pixel in a 4-color image.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, lets come to the <strong>flexible strategy</strong>. To begin with, see the table again:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPOGS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPOGS.png"" alt=""flexibe strategy table""></a></p>

<p>Here we are using standard 3-base codons. From the predefined value for each color (1 to 21), we can find the color using the codon. For example, from the same sequence:</p>

<p>AAGCCCTGGTCAGCT</p>

<p>Ignore AAG again and start with CCC. From the table, CCC encodes a value of 1. Move to next, TGG encodes a value of 16, TCA encodes 10 and GCT encodes 7, and so on for longer sequences. So, now we get an image with 4 pixels i.e. 2 x 2 with the pixels having color code 1, 16, 10, 7. In this way, each pixel can have a color from predefined values. On extracting this data, the image comes out as (from <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/scientists-code-an-animated-gif-into-dna-1796848053"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gizmodo</a>):</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gPmSg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gPmSg.jpg"" alt=""image""></a></p>

<p>The above part talked mostly about the single image of a hand. Now, talking about the horse-riding GIF, the process is almost the same. Here, we have to encode 5 images instead of one. Scientists encoded these 5 images in 5 different cells. After culturing them for some generations, they extracted the information of all images (using standard bioinformatics tools) and compiled them to get the GIF back. The initial and final GIFs look like this (from <a href=""http://www.wired.com/story/scientists-upload-a-galloping-horse-gif-into-bacteria-with-crispr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wired.com</a>):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/247eN.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/247eN.gif"" alt=""GIF""></a></p>

<p><strong>What do these <em>rigid</em> and <em>flexible</em> mean?</strong></p>

<p>In this technique, the terms <em>rigid</em> and <em>flexible</em> are more about individual base rather than the codon. In the <em>rigid</em> strategy, the value of each base is fixed i.e. rigid. For example, in any sequence, C will encode the value '00', whatever the next or previous base is. This means that in both CCCT and GGTC, C has its rigid value '00'. So, for a 4-color image, where each base rigidly corresponds to the color of a pixel, we get as many pixels as the bases in the sequence.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the <em>flexible</em> strategy, the individual bases do not have a fixed value, and the overall value of a pixet is defined by all the bases encoding that pixet. For example, TCC encodes a value of 6 while CCC encodes 1. The value of individual base is degenerate (or <em>flexible</em>), hence the name <em>flexible strategy</em>.</p>

<p>Thus, in a nutshell, while the rigid strategy is more efficient since one pixel is defined by one base (whereas in flexible strategy, one pixel is defined by one codon), the flexible strategy is better suited for getting more colored images since you get more color options by increasing the number of bases in a codon (whereas you only get 4 colors in rigid strategy, defined by 4 bases).</p>

<p><strong>Why are we ignoring AAG?</strong></p>

<p>As @canadianer points out in their answer, AAG is a <strong>PAM</strong> i.e. Protospacer Adjacent Motif. According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protospacer_adjacent_motif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is a 2-6 base pair DNA sequence immediately following the DNA sequence targeted by the Cas9 nuclease in the CRISPR bacterial adaptive immune system. PAM is a component of the invading virus or plasmid, but is not a component of the bacterial CRISPR locus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In simple terms (avoiding technical details), PAM is required for the CRISPR to function, but is not a part of the sequence itself. Much like a punctuation, it is necessary for proper functioning of CRISPR, but it is not to be read for encoding/decoding purpose. For the Cas9 found in <em>E. coli</em> (and is the most popular one), the sequence AAG serves as a PAM and is thus not used for encoding purpose here. Scientists also avoided to use AAG in their pixets so that there wouldn't be more than one recognition site for integration (ignore this point if you're unaware of the working of CRISPR).</p>

"What is in the space between neurons in a brain?","4446","","<p>When neuron animations are displayed, there are frequently seen neurons, axons arranged in a lattice with a lot of empty space between. I'm interested if there is indeed empty space in the brain, or if it is filled with some sort of fluid? I've checked an article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"" rel=""nofollow"">cerebrospinal fluid</a> but am not sure that it is present all throughout the brain.</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking is that I'm thinking of neurotransmitters- they are released in synapses, but I'm not sure how they stay there - are they suspended in some liquid as well?</p>
","<p>Not so empty, actually.</p>

<p>The human brain has a mass of ~1.5kg, and volume ~1200cc (a little bigger for men, a little smaller for women). So is heavier than water by a good margin.</p>

<p>While it has Cerebrospinal fluid, that only occupies the subarachnoid space (the space below the skull and above the cortex, contained between two layers: pia matter and arachnoid membrane) and the ventricular system (several spaces inside the brain, remnants of the embryological development of the brain).</p>

<p>Neuron density may vary widely, depending mainly on the particular characteristics of neuron cell types and their interconnections. But besides neurons, there's a lot of infrastructure inside the brain. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Astroglia: They are a type of glial cells which participate in the formation of the blood-brain barrier (supporting the endothelial cells), nourishing of neurons, maintenance of ion and neurotransmitter concentrations, among others. They also keep in place most of the tissue.</li>
<li>Microglia: Small cells with immune (phagocitic) functions inside the brain.</li>
<li>Radial glia: A more specialized precursor cell, that also participates in neuronal migration in the brain.</li>
<li>Oligodendrocites: Cells responsible for the insulation (myelination) of axons.</li>
<li>Neuroepithelial cells: The stem cells in the brain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neuroglia, which includes the first four cell types above, accounts for ~90% of tissue in human brain (<a href=""http://classes.biology.ucsd.edu/bipn140.WI13/documents/Gliamorethanjustbrainglue.pdf"">http://classes.biology.ucsd.edu/bipn140.WI13/documents/Gliamorethanjustbrainglue.pdf</a>). </p>

<p>Also, when you collect some billions of axons, they can be quite representative in terms of mass and volume. The ratio between white matter and gray matter is close to one for humans, but lower for smaller mammals (<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/97/10/5621.full.pdf"">http://www.pnas.org/content/97/10/5621.full.pdf</a>).</p>

<p>About the last part of your question, the synaptic cleft (the space between pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons) is a salty solution: water with high concentration of sodium and chloride ions (and also calcium ions, neurotransmitters and a lot more). These ion concentrations are fundamental to the generation of action potentials, neural signaling, and the general dynamics of the brain.</p>

<p>This reaction holds for DNA replication as well as transcription. </p>

<p>Translation is all about protein synthesis from amino acid precursors. Each subsequent amino acid is coupled to the growing peptide by a peptide bond between the carboxyl of the growing peptide and the amino group of the new amino acid. A water molecule is eliminated during the reaction (Fig. 2).</p>

<p>Hence translation can be written analogously to replication as:</p>

<pre>
amino acid + peptide<sub>(n)</sub> → peptide<sub>(n+1)</sub> </pre> 

<p>However, also in this polymerization reaction energy is needed and amino acids are <a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/dna/a/translation/trna_aminoact.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">activated</a> while they are bound to the messenger RNA (mRNA) through the action of ATP. Moreover, during translation the <a href=""http://bscb.org/learning-resources/softcell-e-learning/ribosome/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ribosome (i.e., the protein synthesizing machinery)</a> uses another source of energy to move across the RNA template, namely GTP. Hence, the <em>net</em> reaction can be written as:</p>

amino acid + peptide<sub>(n)</sub> + ATP + GTP → peptide<sub>(n+1)</sub> + AMP + GDP + PP<sub>i</sub> + P<sub>i</sub> </pre>

"What am I looking at in Franklin's Photo 51 of DNA?","4442","","<p>Here's Rosalind Franklin's famous <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_51"" rel=""noreferrer"">Photo 51</a>, the X-ray diffraction image of DNA from which Watson and Crick deduced its structure:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8XHZX.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8XHZX.jpg"" alt=""Rosalind Franklin&#39;s Photo 51""></a></p>

<p>My understanding is that it depicts a short segment of DNA shown from the side (so the axis that the strands wind around would run up and down through the center of the photo). Like this double-helix diagram from Watson and Crick's paper:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXwbv.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXwbv.jpg"" alt=""Double helix diagram""></a></p>

<p>I have a lot of trouble connecting the photo to the diagram.</p>

<p>What am I actually seeing in the photo? There are dark blobs at the top and bottom. A diamond shape of dark lines. A concentric circle (or rounded diamond) inside the outer diamond. An X formed from two intersecting rows of 7ish mostly horizontal short lines or blobs. Which of these features correspond to what parts of the DNA molecule?</p>
","<p>Well, you said that you...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...have a lot of trouble connecting the photo to the diagram.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that's quite excusable: interpreting that X-ray image is actually <strong>very</strong> complicated . </p>

<p>All the quotes and images in this answer, except the bulleted list further down, come from <a href=""https://www.unamur.be/sciences/physique/udp/documents/Francis-Crick-JCE-paper.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this paper</a> (Lucas, 2008), which explains that historic picture in details.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I always though that that image depicted the X-ray going <em>longitudinally</em> (that is, along the main axis) through the DNA. However, it goes transversely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When filamentous macromolecules are packed in a fibre along a fixed direction, the X-ray intensities diffracted by the fibre fall on the observation screen along approximately straight and equidistant lines, the so-called layer lines, <strong>perpendicular</strong> to that direction. This important concept was introduced by Michael Polanyi in 1921 for the X-ray study of cellulose. (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are the so called <em>layer lines</em> (I'm keeping the original paper's legend in all images):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXcir.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXcir.jpg"" alt=""Fig.2 Principle of the geometrical construction of the hyperbolic layer lines in the X-ray diffraction pattern of a linear array of point scatterers (dark circles) with period P. ES: Ewald Sphere; LP: Layer Planes; LL: Layer Lines. The shaded regions are cones whose intersections by the screen generate the layer lines.""></a></p>

<p>Then, still according to the paper, Crick and others started to hypothesise how would be the X-ray diffraction in a monoatomic helix: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1952, Cochran, Crick and Vand developed an analytical theory for X-ray diffraction by a monoatomic helix. The immediate interest of their theory was to give a transparent, analytical expression of these amplitudes at a time, in 1952, when computers, if at all available, were barely capable of a brute force calculation of the total diffraction intensity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the X-ray diffraction pattern in a monoatomic helix, which is quite important to understand the famous DNA diffraction image later on:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rEWny.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rEWny.jpg"" alt=""Fig.3 Computer simulated pattern of X-ray diffraction by a phosphorus helix of period P, radius r and atomic repeat p_a. Notice the central St Andrew&#39;s cross, the Bessel oscillations along the layer lines and the diamond pattern (highlighted by broken lines) with nearly empty North and South diamonds. The structural parameters of the helix (P, r, p_a) are readable from the geometrical parameters of the pattern (2pi/P, alpha, 2pi/p_a).""></a></p>

<p>Thus, with that theoretical background, we can understand our famous image:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vls93.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vls93.jpg"" alt=""Fig.4 The historic X-ray fibre diffraction patterns (a) of A-DNA and (b) B-DNA plotted on the same scale. The 8th layer line of pattern (a) occurs at about the 10th layer line of pattern (b) reflecting a 20% increase in the DNS helix period. The A-DNA pattern shows crystalline spots on the first few layer lines.""></a></p>

<p>In this image, a X-ray diffraction image of A-DNA (left) and the more common B-DNA (right) show a periodic pattern in the layer lines.</p>

<p>The diffraction patterns can be interpreted as follows (<a href=""https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-physically-interpret-the-different-diffraction-patterns-between-A-DNA-and-B-DNA"" rel=""noreferrer"">source</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>The layer line separation reveals the value of the polymer repeat period. The decrease of over 20% of the layer line spacing when going from A to B implies an increase of that much in the period: P = 2.8 nm for A-DNA and 3.4 nm for B-DNA.</li>
<li>Look at the sharp, discrete spots observed near the center of the
diffraction pattern for A-DNA along the first few layer lines, these
suggest the crystalline order in the fibre. In the high-humidity
B-DNA pattern, these crystalline spots are absent, suggesting that
the extra water molecules must have invaded the space between the DNA
molecules, freeing them from being locked into crystallites.</li>
<li>The thick arcs at the top and bottom of the B-DNA pattern are found at approximately 10 layer line intervals from the center, implying that B-DNA had 10 repeating units within one period of 3.4 nm. These are produced by the scattering of X-rays by the equidistant, nearly horizontal flat bases separated by 0.34 nm. The A-DNA pattern lacks these big smears, suggesting that the bases in A-DNA are not horizontal, and the number of base pairs per helical period is closer to 11.</li>
<li>The central cross in B-DNA represents the Saint Andrew cross expected
from a helical molecule. The large radius r (1 nm, indicated by the
meridian angle of the cross) and the absence of intensity in the
meridian diamonds indicates that the phosphate backbone is at the
periphery of the helix. This cross appears to be absent in A-DNA,
however, this is due to destructive interference from some of the
inclined base pairs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, this is an image better relating the double strand structure of the DNA (both A and B DNAs) with the X-ray diffraction image:</p>

"What is the relationship between independent assortment and cross over?","4442","","<p>During meiosis, the independent assortment will be made first and then cross over will be made. I am so confused, what is the difference between this two process? I looked at the diagram on internet.It is said that law of independent assortment is alleles of genes on non homologous chromosomes assort independently during gametes formation, but I don't quite understand that. 
So, another way for understanding this topic, independent assortment is tetrads can line up four different ways between homologous separate. Is that right.
Appreciate your help.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>During meiosis, the independent assortment will be made first and then cross over will be made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, independent assortment occurs <em>after</em> crossing over. Crossing over occurs in prophase I while independent assortment occurs in metaphase I and anaphase I.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am so confused, what is the difference between this two process?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During prophase I, a process called <strong>synapsis</strong> occurs. That is, homologous chromosomes (one from your mother and one from your father) come together and bind together, forming a <strong>tetrad</strong>. This binding is due to <strong>crossing over</strong>, which is when the genetic material on the maternal chromosome and the paternal chromosome exchange places. The maternal chromosome gives some of its genes to the paternal chromosome, and the paternal chromosome gives some of its genes to the maternal chromosome. <strong>Crossing over increases genetic variety by creating a new chromosome with a new combination of genes.</strong></p>

<p>During metaphase I, the tetrads line up at the equator of the cell. During anaphase one, the tetrads are broken apart and each homologous chromosome that made each tetrad up is pulled toward one end of the cell. Look at the image below, where the blue represents paternal chromosomes and the red represents maternal chromosomes.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sHbXI.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sHbXI.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>Independent assortment</strong> describes the phenomenon where the paternal and maternal chromosomes can be lined up randomly at the equator. There are many combinations. For example,</p>

<ul>
<li>Both red chromosomes could face the top pole and both blue
chromosomes could face the bottom pole.</li>
<li>Both blue chromosomes could face the top pole and both red could face the bottom.</li>
<li>One red on the left and one blue on the right could face the top, as shown in the picture.</li>
<li>One blue on the left and one red on the right could face the top.</li>
</ul>

<p>This random alignment at the equator makes it so that during anaphase, random proportions of maternal and paternal chromosomes get assorted into each of the resulting daughter cells. Some cells could get more maternal chromosomes and the other would get more paternal chromosomes, and vice versa. On the other hand, they could get similar amounts. <strong>Independent assortment increases genetic variation by allowing daughter cells to each <em>randomly</em> receive a different proportion of paternal and maternal chromosomes.</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, crossing over and independent assortment (sometimes called random assortment) are different independent processes that both lead to an increase in genetic diversity.</p>

"What is the strand specificity of a reference genome?","4429","","<p>It's a simple question but I've come across many people who have this question, is the reference genome Positive of Negative strand? Indeed, I've had heated arguments over the same issue. </p>

<p>So here's to putting all those questions to rest.</p>

<p>Is the reference genome a positive or a negative strand? And why so.</p>
","<p>First of all, the reference genome strand specificity is referred to as sense (positive strand) or antisense (negative strand).</p>

<p>Here's a somewhat incorrect note from the wiki article under <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_(molecular_biology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sense (molecular biology)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The strand names actually depend on which direction you are writing
  the sequence that contains the information for proteins (the ""sense""
  information), not on which strand is on the top or bottom (that is
  arbitrary). The only real biological information that is important for
  labeling strands is the location of the 5' phosphate group and the 3'
  hydroxyl group because these ends determine the direction of
  transcription and translation. A sequence 5' CGCTAT 3' is equivalent
  to a sequence written 3' TATCGC 5' as long as the 5' and 3' ends are
  noted. If the ends are not labeled, convention is to assume that the
  sequence is written in the 5' to 3' direction. Watson strand refers to
  5' to 3' top strand (5' → 3'), whereas Crick strand refers to 5' to 3'
  bottom strand (3' ← 5').[4] Both Watson and Crick strands can be
  either sense or antisense strands depending on the gene whose
  sequences are displayed in the genome sequence database. For example,
  YEL021W, an alias of URA3 gene used in NCBI database, defines that
  this gene is located on the 21st open reading frame (ORF) from the
  centromere of the left arm (L) of Yeast (Y) chromosome number V (E),
  and that the expression coding strand is Watson strand (W). YKL074C
  defines the 74th ORF to the left of the centromere of chromosome XI
  and denotes coding strand from the Crick strand (C). Another confusing
  term referring to ""Plus"" and ""Minus"" strand is also widely used.
  Whatever the strand is a sense (positive) or antisense (negative), the
  default query sequence in NCBI BLAST alignment is ""Plus"" strand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it is correct when it says </p>

<ol>
<li>Watson = Sense = Plus Strands</li>
<li>Crick = Antisense = Negative Strands</li>
</ol>

<p>A satisfactory answer/convention is provided/suggested in this PMC article covering <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3055211/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the terminology of the Watson and Crick strands</a> </p>

<p>Below are some interesting excerpts from the publication:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The earliest reference that we could find to the ""Watson strand"" and
  the ""Crick strand"" is somewhat tongue-in-cheek and comes from a pair
  of papers in 1967 by Wacław Szybalski and colleagues. They
  bound the two DNA strands of phage λ to the synthetic polynucleotide,
  poly(IG), which has an affinity to cytosine-rich regions. They then
  separated the two strands by density, which turned out to be
  determined by the amount of bound poly(IG). In a cesium-chloride
  density gradient, the strand with more bound poly(IG) was denser and
  heavier than its complement. Because the ""dense"" strand was
  cytosine-rich, Szybalski and colleagues called it the ""C strand.""
  Logically, thus, the complementary strand, which was guanine rich,
  should have been the ""G strand."" Instead, it was christened the ""W
  strand.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the authors note that the Strands started on their terminology journey with their roles reversed with the Crick strand specifying the heavy strand (with IG) and the Watson strand specifying the lighter one.</p>

<p>They also note that the present day terminology of the WC model is non-arbitratrily based on the current horizontal drawing convention where one strand is placed on top and the other at the bottom.</p>

<p>They also suggested a typical convention which is followed today. If it was due to their suggestion is a different matter altogether, but beyond the scope of this question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given the amount of effort already spent on standardizing such
  databases, and their influence on other disciplines, we feel that the
  genomic definition of Watson and Crick strands has the most mass
  behind it. Specifically, we find that the unambiguous usage of the
  Saccharomyces Genome Database to be the most useful. Under the first
  part of our proposal, the centromere is a reference point that divides
  a chromosome into two arms of unequal length. The chromosome is
  oriented so that shorter arm is on the left and the longer arm on the
  right. Furthermore, the top strand has its 5'-end at the left
  (short-arm) telomere and its 3'-end at the right (long-arm) telomere.
  This strand is the Watson strand. Similarly, the bottom strand has its
  5'-end at the right telomere and its 3' at the left telomere and is
  the Crick strand. We further propose that ""top"", ""forward"", and ""plus""
  be used as synonyms for the Watson strand and ""bottom"", ""reverse"", and
  ""minus"" for the Crick strand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and later on...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it is ultimately impossible to distinguish Watson and Crick strands
  using biological properties, then we propose that Watson should refer
  to the stand arbitrarily used as a reference in a database (i.e. the
  ""plus"" stand) and the Crick strand should refer to its complement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But let's come to sequencing data or FASTQ files. When we align reads, a resulting SAM or BAM file has a column specifying strand information, we usually see a + or - strand. </p>

<p>Which suggests that the product originated from either the Watson (positive) or the Crick (negative) strands. For example, a read is actually the reverse complement of the product, but since you do a PCR step during you library preparation, that particular bit of information is lost and therefore the downstream analysis protocols tend to consider the entire loci any single product aligns to.</p>

Neither <em>S thermophilus</em> nor <em>L bulgaricus</em> was recovered from the stomach or small intestine of subjects fed yogurt or pasteurized yogurt. ADH was recovered from gastric or small intestinal aspirates in three of four subjects and in the stools of four of five subjects diagnosed with atrophic gastritis. In 11 of 12 normal subjects, ADH was isolated from stools. There was a significant reduction in fecal bacterial enzyme activity in both normal volunteers and subjects with atrophic gastritis after being fed with viable ADH.

"What implications has the missing 2'-OH on the capability of DNA to form 3D structures?","4369","","<p>The chemical difference between RNA and DNA is the missing 2'-hydroxyl group in the nucleotides that build DNA.

But I'm wondering whether this difference has significant implications for the ability of DNA to form compex, three-dimensional structures.</p>

<p>RNA is known to be able to from complex tertiary structures and function as ribozymes. It clearly has the ability to form a wide range of structures and can catalyze a variety of chemical reactions.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there are no naturally occuring catalytic DNAs known. But a number of synthetic DNA enzymes have been created in the lab, so it is generally possible for DNA to form catalytic structures (see <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1074-5521%2894%2990014-0"">Breaker and Joyce 1994</a> for the first created DNA enzyme).</p>

<p>I'm wondering whether the missing 2'-OH means that DNA has less potential to form complex structures compared to RNA? I imagine it changes the ability to create hydrogen bonds, but I don't know if it would significantly decrease the potential structures that DNA could adopt.</p>

","<p>To make sure I'm not comparing apples and pears, my (attempt to) answer the question will be broken into two parts: comparison of single-stranded nucleic acids and double stranded ones.</p>

<h3>Single stranded DNA and RNA</h3>

<p>Both DNA and <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10458781"">RNA</a> can form single-stranded complex tertiary structures in which the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_secondary_structure"">secondary structure elements</a> are associated through van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds. The presence of a 2'-hydroxyl group makes ribose ring prefer different <a href=""http://online-media.uni-marburg.de/chemie/bioorganic/vorlesung1/kapitel1e.html?/chemie/bioorganic/vorlesung1/k1e-20.html"">conformations</a> than deoxyribose in DNA. Also, since 2′-OH moiety is both a hydrogen donor and acceptor, it provides RNA with greater <em>flexibility</em> to form 3D complex structures and <em>stability</em> to remain in one of these conformations. As Aleadam notices, this <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2338076"">paper</a> shows that tRNA and its DNA analog form similar tertiary structures though tDNA is not as stable as tRNA:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, we submit that the global conformation of nucleic acids is primarily dictated by the interaction of purine and pyrimidine bases with atoms and functional groups common to both RNA and DNA. In this view the 2-hydroxyl group, in tRNA at least, is an auxiliary structural feature whose role is limited to fostering local interactions, which increase the stability of a given conformation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These authors also show that at least one loop in the tDNA analog is more susceptible to cleavage by a restriction endonuclease. In this region the tRNA has a water molecule hydrogen bonded to 2'hydroxyl group.</p>

<p>I was not able to find more of such interesting comparisons in the literature.</p>

<h3>Double stranded DNA and RNA</h3>

<p>Both DNA and RNA can form double-stranded structures. Again, sugar conformation determines the shape of the helix: for DNA helix it's usually <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Nucleic_Acid/DNA/DNA_structure#Secondary_Structures_of_DNA"">B-form</a>, whereas helical RNA forms A-geometry under nearly all conditions. In RNA helix we find the ribose predominantly in the <a href=""http://online-media.uni-marburg.de/chemie/bioorganic/vorlesung1/kapitel1e.html?/chemie/bioorganic/vorlesung1/k1e-20.html"">C3’- endo</a> conformation, as 2'-OH stericly disfavors the C2'-endo conformaion, necessary for B-form geometry.</p>

<h3>Physiological significance</h3>

<p>dsRNA and ssDNA often provide a signal to the cell that something is wrong. dsRNA is of course seen in normal processes like RNA interference but it can also stop protein synthesis and signal viral infections (cf. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-stranded_RNA_viruses"">double stranded RNA viruses</a>). Similarly, ssDNA is much more prone to degradation than dsDNA, it often signals damage of DNA, or infections from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_virus#Group_II%3a_ssDNA_viruses"">single stranded DNA viruses</a> and induces cell death. Therefore, due to their functions, under normal conditions DNA 3D structure is mostly a double-stranded helix, whereas RNA has a single stranded, ""protein-like"", complex 3D structure. </p>

<p>It is apparent that the units of $R$ (e.g. $mol/g/s$) cancel out, but what about the units of temperature? Does $Q_{10}$ have units? It seems the units would be ""<em>per 10 &deg;C</em>"", but it is not clear how this comes from the referenced equation</p>

The curves show the percentage activity remaining as the incubation period increases. From the top they represent equal increases in the incubation temperature (50 &deg;C, 55 &deg;C, 60 &deg;C, 65 &deg;C and 70 &deg;C).</p>

<p>The $Q_{10}$ is a unitless number, that summarizes the effect of raising temperature 10&deg;C on the rate of a chemical reaction. A $Q_{10}$ of 2.0 suggests that raising the temperature of a system by 10 &deg;C will effectively double the rate of the reaction. This value would be expected for most chemical reactions occurring within normal physiological temperatures.  </p>

<p>Mathematically, $Q_{10}$ can be represented by the following expression:</p>

<p>$$Q_{10}=\left(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\right)^{\frac{10}{t_2-t_1}}$$</p>

<p>$t_2$ = higher temperature<br>
$k_2$ = rate at $t_2$<br>
$t_1$ = lower temperature<br>
$k_1$ = rate at $t_1$</p>

<p>Usually the temperature difference is about 10 &deg;C, then you can simplify the equation</p>

"Difference/similarity between adaptive radiation and species divergence?","4332","","<p>I've been reading various answers on different sites but I still don't know whether adaptive radiation and species divergence are different or similar.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<p>1) On some sites, it says that adaptive radiation is a form of species divergence, while on others it says that they are different. Which one is correct?</p>

<p>2) Is the main difference that adaptive radiation occurs relatively rapidly and species divergence takes longer?</p>

<p>3) Darwin's finches is used as an example for adaptive radiation, but is it also an example of species divergence?</p>

","<h1>Adaptive Radiation</h1>

<p>A <strong>radiation</strong> refers to the process by which one species rapidly speciate into a number of different species. A radiation can be <em>adaptive</em> or <em>non-adaptive</em>. An <strong>adaptive radiation</strong> is a type of radiation when new species are formed through selection into new <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ecological niches</a>. Such adaptive radiation typically occurs after the raise of a key mutation that allows for further specialization such as a mutation causing a change in the <a href=""http://Pharyngeal%20jaw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pharyngeal jaw</a> as observed in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cichlid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cichlids</a> (<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/96/9/5107"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Albertson et al. 1998</a>).</p>

<p>You can learn much more on adaptive radiation in the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Ecology-Adaptive-Radiation-Dolph-Schluter/dp/0198505221"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Ecology of Adaptive Radiation</em> by D. Schluter</a></p>

<h1>Species divergence</h1>

<p><strong>Species divergence</strong> refers to the process by which two existing species diverge through time, either through the accumulation of neutral (or non-neutral but equally selected) mutations or by selection on different trait values.</p>

<h1>Species Divergence and Adaptive Radiation</h1>

<p>Because of the semantic difficulties behind the concept of species (see <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39664/how-could-humans-have-interbred-with-neanderthals-if-were-a-different-species/39669#39669"">here</a>), it is unclear from which point can we talk about species divergence and by which point the observed process of divergence is only divergence within a metapopulation.</p>

<p>Ignoring the eventual detail of the definition of species, and considering species divergence as referring to the divergence between any two lineage (whether or not in reproductive isolation), then it is clear that species divergence is part of the process of adaptive radiation.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>To answer your multiple questions directly</strong></p>

<p>1) On some sites, it says that adaptive radiation is a form of species divergence, while on others it says that they are different. Which one is correct?</p>

<p><em>Adaptive radiation is a little more than a form of species divergence as it includes also the event by which divergences starts.</em></p>

<p>2) Is the main difference that adaptive radiation occurs relatively rapidly and species divergence takes longer?</p>

<p><em>mmhhh... not exactly as the concept of radiation also refers to the event allowing the divergence to happen</em></p>

<p>3) Darwin's finches is used as an example for adaptive radiation, but is it also an example of species divergence?</p>

<p><em>Yes, indeed! No radiation, without species divergence. On the other hand species divergence will occur between any two existing species regardless of whether they speciated through a radiation</em></p>

<p>4) Are the finches on the galapagos islands all difference species (one species diverged into many)? Or are they all the same species, just with different characteristics (e.g size of beak)?</p>

<p><em>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Darwin's finches</a> refers to about 15 (different) species. The different species of Darwin's finches do NOT refer to intra-species variation but to different species. In other words, there is some reproductive isolation between these different species.

","<p>As you correctly say, tendons are made up of collagen fibers. Collagen is one of the most important proteins (or, to be more specific, family of proteins, as there are many types of collagen) forming connective tissue in the body.</p>

<p>Collagen molecules have a particular structure that allows them to form long fibers, composed by three different strands that form a triple helix. This is a schema of a collagen helix (each ball represents one aminoacid):</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Collagentriplehelix.png/120px-Collagentriplehelix.png"" alt=""Collagen helix""><br>
(source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

<p>These helices can then be bound together to form a collagen fiber, through the action of an enzyme called <em>lysyl oxidase</em> which binds two lysine residues from two different helices together (lysine is one of the aminoacids that makes up collagen).</p>

<p>Here is a scanning electron microscope of a collagen fiber:</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.sciencephoto.com/image/80742/530wm/C0016340-Synovial_collagen_fibres,_SEM-SPL.jpg"" alt=""Collagen fiber, SEM""><br>
(source: <a href=""https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/80742/enlarge"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Science photo library</a>)</p>

<p>Collagen is secreted out of the cells that produce it so, although there may be cells around the collagen molecules, it is important to understand that it is part of what is called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extracellular matrix</a>, the extracellular structure that supports the cells in our body.</p>

<p>As for the photo you linked, it is an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%26E_stain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain</a> of a tendon. Hematoxylin colours cell nuclei in dark blue, so the dark spots are definitely cells.

"Why does the pET- expression vector contain a LacI gene additionally to the one in the genome?","4308","","<p>The pET plasmid is used for protein expression with T7 promotor in expression strains, such as <em>E.coli</em> BL21(DE3)</p>

<p>If a <em>lac</em> expression construct is present at more than 100 copies per cell the result will be leaky repression, and this can result in selection for mutations in the gene of interest if it has deleterious effects on the host bacteria.

"How does the immune system ""learn"" from a vaccine?","4282","","<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing
  microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the
  microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent
  stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as foreign,
  destroy it, and ""remember"" it, so that the immune system can more
  easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later
  encounters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:  How does the immune system """"remember"""" a foreign agent introduced via a vaccine?  And how does it learn how to deal with subsequent encounters?</p>
","<p>Vaccines work by introducing an attenuated strain of the pathogen (or alternatively the antigens that are normally present on the pathogens surface) into the body, whereupon the body mounts an immune response.  As this will (hopefully) be the first time that the body has encountered the antigens on the pseudo-pathogen's surface, the response is called the primary response.  </p>

<p>This consists of two main divisions: the cell mediated pathway and the humoral pathway.  In vaccination it is the humoral pathway that is important.  This is where a division of white blood cells (B-Cells) produce antibodies that are complementary to the antigens on the pathogen surface, causing a negative effect to the pathogen (death, inability to reproduce, de-activation of toxins, etc.).  However as each B-Cell produces a different antibody, there needs to be a mechanism to select the correct one:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Antigen Presentation</strong> (technically part of the cell-mediated-response) - a phagocyte engulfs the pathogen and displays the pathogenic antigens on its own surface.</li>
<li><strong>Clonal Selection</strong> - B-Cells that are attracted to the invasion site attempt to bind their antibodies onto the pathogen's antigens.  <strong>It takes time for this to occur successfully</strong> as you are essentially waiting for the correct mutation to happen. </li>
<li><strong>Clonal Expansion</strong> - Once a complementary antibody producing B-Cell has been found it is then activated with the help of a T-Helper cell.  This causes it to divide rapidly whereupon these cloned specific B cells can secrete their antibodies which will cause detriment to the pathogen. </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>It's at this point that I can start to answer your specific question.  The large clone of B cells will then sub-divide into two types.  Plasma Cells remain in the blood and produce antibodies to fight the infection.  The other type, much smaller in proportion, are called Memory Cells.  These cells have a very long lifetime and move to lymph nodes across the body (including the spleen), where they remain dormant until the same pathogen is found again.  </p>

<p>When this is the case, the memory cells are activated by T-helpers so that they can divide into massive numbers of plasma cells to fight the infection the second time.  This secondary response is a much faster as the clonal selection stage does not have to wait for the right mutation - they are already waiting in the lymph nodes.  The response is also much stronger as each memory cell can produce large numbers of plasma cells - i.e. you can start with multiple activated B-cells (as many as you have memory cells) rather than just the one that has mutated into a complementary shape in the primary immune response.</p>

<p>The aim of the vaccine is for the secondary response to be so quick that potentially life threatening symptoms do not occur; the body has time to find and store the correct antigen in a safe environment as the pathogen has been deactivated.  </p>

I am also not interested in the trivial answer: that the voltage-gated channels are configured to require a transition across the -40mV or so threshold in order to fire an action potential. It seems to me that this threshold is arbitrary; if there was no advantage to maintaining this gradient then neurons would have evolved to avoid it.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Or better yet, pointers to places where this has already been answered? </p>

<p>My best guess so far looks like this: The total range of available voltages is more-or-less fixed from -90 to +50mV. We want to avoid getting too close to either end, since the channels become less effective near their reversal potentials, so maybe the effective range is more like -70 to +30 (to go outside that range, we must sacrifice speed). Within that 100mV range, we leave the bottom 30mV or so for EPSP integration, and the other 60mV for action potentials.  Now, if the resting potential was 0mV, the available dynamic range for integration and spiking would be much smaller which probably translates to making the output noisier. </p>
","<p>Essentially all animal cells maintain an ionic balance causing a resting potential of about -70 mV in order to maintain their internal environment including pH, ion concentrations, osmotic pressure and volume. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21627/"" rel=""nofollow"">Lodish, <em>Molecular Cell Biology</em></a>)  Neurons developed from existing types of cells and it's unlikely that the cost of maintaining resting potential in the neuron could have driven evolution of an entire alternative system to provide the homeostasis supported by the existing system.</p>

<p>Note that the depolarization of the membrane at any particular place during an impulse is very short so the impact of the ion flows have only limited effect on the cell's overall internal environment beyond requiring adjustment by ion pumps for the losses involved.  It also is not obvious how the wave-like characteristic of a nerve impulse could be generated if the membrane did not carry a nonzero potential; there would be no stored energy (in the form of ion gradients) available to make the pulse swiftly spread across the membrane.</p>

<p>Another point to consider is that the perhaps 15% of a neuron's energy spent on replacing leaking ions may have some hidden usefulness.  <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23479331?dopt=Abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">This paper</a> suggests that neurons may actually be set up to leak at a rate higher than they would if it were minimized.</p>

"Basic Amino Acid Residue Binding Mechanism to DNA","4236","","<p>I understand that many protein DNA binding domains bind to DNA via basic residues such as Arginine and Lysine. But what is the mechanism used to bind to DNA and where on the DNA would these residues bind?  </p>
","<p>This question has no particular answer.  There are several families of DNA binding proteins, some of them bind specifically (e.g. restriction enzymes like EcoRI which binds to and cuts GAATTC or transcription factors like <a href=""http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/L/LacOperon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">lac repressor</a> which binds a particular point of the e coli genome about 25 base pairs long) and some of them bind semi-specifically (e.g. zinc fingers which bind GC rich regions), others non specifically (e.g. <a href=""http://www.cs.stedwards.edu/chem/Chemistry/CHEM43/CHEM43/Projects04/Clamps/STRUCTURE.HTML"" rel=""nofollow"">the sliding DNA clamp</a>).  </p>

<p>For all of these proteins, they will have a tendency to have positively charged amino acids facing the DNA because the DNA's phosphate backbone is negatively charged.  There are lots of protein motifs (like the helix turn helix motif) that fits into the major or minor groove of the DNA.  The lysine and argenine are important because they are the positively charged amino acids.  Histidine is also positively charged, but it is not as long and flexible, and doesn't seem to fit as often or as well. </p>

"What is the ""lifecycle"" of an average eschar and what types of cells are involved in each stage?","4230","","<p>(after some deliberation in the comments, I've decided to make the question more general)</p>

<p>An <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschar"" rel=""nofollow"">eschar</a> or ""dry scab"" often forms at a site of injury over a large cut or sore.</p>

<p>It seems as though the healing scab portion binds more strongly to the other scab cells than to those of the surrounding healthy tissue initially, as evidenced by the ability to remove the scab <em>en masse</em> without disturbing the edges of the actual wound (in surgical debridement or when the area is ""picked"" at).  Then, the eschar bonds then bonds more strongly with the edges of the wounds (so it's more difficult to remove), and then finally, the underlying newly formed skin seems to push it off completely.</p>

<p>Does this accurately describe the ""lifecycle"" of a common dry scab, or are there other well defined stages in the process?  What types of cells (platelets in the beginning?  epithelials at the end?) are involved with each stage of the process?</p>
","<p>Response to cutaneous tissue damage occurs is several distinct but overlapping phases. First an scab is formed as the blood is 'allowed' to clot. A matrix is formed as the platelets adhere to one another, which contracts and 'dries' (forces out the serum) to form a scab. This process clearly happens prior to tissue regeneration/formation to reduce further blood loss.</p>

<h3>Fibrinogen</h3>

<p>In response to damage to blood vessels a signaling cascade is initated that results in the <em>massive</em> production of <strong>fibrin</strong>, which is deposited at the site of wounding and subsequently forms blood clots by activating platelets and stabilising the matrix by cross-linking (<a href=""http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2006_11/Page1.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see PDB's protein of the month 2006</a>).</p>

<p>So this is why clots do not appear to be attached to the surrounding tissue; the fibrin causes the blood to form a matrix that is very tightly bound to itself. Only after clot formation does the tissue remodeling occur, and it is during this stage that the scab will 'bind' more stongly to the surrounding tissue.</p>

"Why is the DNA codon table ""equal"" to the RNA codon table","4223","","<p>Before anything else please pay attention of the double quotes on the ""equal"" in the title - I know they are not equal, but you will understand in a bit.</p>

<p>If I look at the DNA codon table <a href=""http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/Codons.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> or in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a>, and at the RNA codon table <a href=""http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/Codons.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> or in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code#RNA_codon_table"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a>, their only difference is that the former has thymine (T) whereas the latter has uridine (U). But I am not understanding how all other nucleotides are the same. Bear in mind that transcription reads DNA from 3'->5' and translation reads mRNA from 5'->3'.</p>

<p>Look at this example, focusing on the 3'-TAC-5' of the antisense strand.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7zTjz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The 3'-TAC-5' codes for Tyrosine according to the DNA codon table. However, it transcribes and translates  3'-TAC-5' -> 5'-AUG-3' -> Methionine. </p>

<p>Now focus on the corresponding codon in the sense strand, 5'-ATG-3', which codes for Valine according to the DNA table (it is read from 3' to 5'). This codon transcribes and translates 3'-GTA-5' -> 5'-CAU-3' -> Histidine, not Valine and not Methionine.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why do DNA codon tables show the correspondence between codons and amino acids in the sense strands (5'-ATG-3'), if the only way to go from ATG to Met as in the figure is to consider the antisense strand?</li>
<li>I can see that the AUG codon translates to Methionine, and it is translated by reading the 3'-TAC-5' codon in antisense strand, whose corresponding codon in sense strand is 5'-ATG-3'. But this last one is read from 3'->5', so it reads 3'-GTA-5' -> 5'-CAU-3' -> His.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am guessing I'm getting many things wrongly in this... Maybe on the way that I'm reading  the tables: I always take into account that transcription is read 3'->5' and this is the order I take to read DNA tables.</p>

<p>Thank you and sorry if I was confusing.</p>
","<p>I can understand your confusion but it all makes sense. The basic idea is that what we call the ""antisense"" strand is actually the one being transcribed. However, since that is in effect a mirror image, it is much simpler to think in terms of the sense strand. </p>

<p>To take a very simple example:</p>

<pre><code>5' ATG 3' &lt;-- sense strand
3' TAC 5' &lt;-- antisense strand
</code></pre>

<p>The antisense strand will be read in a 3' to 5' direction:</p>

<pre><code>3' TAC 5' &lt;-- antisense strand
5' AUG 3' &lt;-- mRNA
</code></pre>

<p>Since the mRNA is a mirror image, it has the sequence of the sense strand. It is this mRNA that is then translated and this is read in a 5' to 3' direction. So, AUG is translated as Met. To illustrate, have a look at this image from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_%28biology%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> (click on it for a larger version), </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Protein_translation.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GMIf5.gif"" alt=""protein translation animation""></a></p>

<p>In the image above you can see the growing polypeptide (protein) chain snaking its way through the ribosome. The flying blue things are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_RNA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tRNA molecules</a> and the black chain at the bottom is the mRNA being translated. You can't really see it very well in this image but if you look at the original you can clearly see it is moving from the right towards the left. The right hand side is the 5' end and the left is the 3'. Or, in a more static version (adapted from <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/organic/translation.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>):</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YJL3J.gif"" alt=""protein translation""></p>

<p>So, the <em>antisense</em> strand is read, transcribed to RNA (which has the sequence of the sense strand but with T converted to U) and it is this mRNA which is read (in a 5' to 3' direction) to produce the protein.</p>

"How long will a vegetable live for after being harvested?","4217","","<p>I understand this might depend on the types of vegetables, but is there an average or studied specifics? Does it die immediately? Is there a way to precisely diagnose death in plants? If so, what are the conditions for it?</p>
","<p>The short answer is that as long as the vegetable/fruit is fresh looking - i.e. the cells have not disintegrated - they will be respiring, many cells will be functioning quite normally, and the plant is still technically alive. In cases where the part of the plant we treat as a vegetable is a part intended for reproduction (e.g. a seed, or a tuber like a potato) the plant will keep growing.</p>

<p>The point at which the plant dies is not clearly defined like it is in animals, but generally if you can still eat it, it's still alive.</p>

<p>Death in plants is quite different from that in animals - we refer to it as senescence. The key difference is that it happens to tissues and organs which can die and separate from the organism. Individual leaves can die without the plant's health being affected. Once this has happened to all the parts, the organism is considered dead, but if there is any respiring tissue left, it's still alive.</p>

"What is the scientific opinion on plus lens therapy?","4201","","<p><strong>Plus lens therapy</strong> is the theory that most myopia is environmentally triggered and that conventional corrective minus lenses increase nearsightedness over time.

<p><strong><em>What is the scientific majority and minority opinion on plus lens therapy?</em></strong></p>
","<p>Plus lens therapy can indeed reverse myopia, but it does take time. Your eyes did not develop myopia in a few days.</p>

<p>The eye represents its environment. Fitting chicks, monkeys etc. with minus lenses always INCREASED the amount of myopia, while plus lenses always reduced myopia and resulted in hyperopia (lens compensation).</p>

<p>Putting monkeys in a confined environment showed a myopic shift. Monkeys in an open 
environment showed a refractive state about +1.00 diopters.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: As I have said: Unfortunately, it does take time! Do not expect results after 1 week of plus lens therapy. That is why so many people give up and think that myopia is irreversible. You also do not build muscles after 1 week.</p>

It states that the transcribed RNA forms a hairpin loop (or stem-loop), which halts the transcription process.</p>

<p>My question is, why does it halt the transcription process, considering that the RNA polymerase moves in the opposite direction of where the stem loop is created? Does it somehow change the RNA conformation such that no further bases can be added? Interpreting it as a physical obstacle doesn't seem to make any sense here.</p>
","<p>There are two mechanisms of transcriptional termination in prokaryotes.  The one shown here is ""rho-dependent"" because it involves rho, a DNA-RNA helicase that loads on and unwinds the RNA from the DNA, terminating the elongation by the polymerase.  Check out [<a href=""http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=47221&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>] which shows a model for how rho multimers move through the RNA.</p>

<p>The other mechanism involves just a hairpin. The paper [<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M707998200"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>], especially Page 23, part C, shows how ""rho-independent"" or ""intrinsic"" termination works.  Basically, the hairpin slows down the polymerase and destabilizes the transcription bubble, allowing the intrinsically-weaker A:U bonds to fall apart.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for a hairpin in rho-dependent termination, and I think the movie is mixing them up.</p>

But if someone has comparative data, that is welcomed too.</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Temperature differences of 0.02 degrees Celcius can be distinguished, dependent on various factors including experimental conditions and bodily location.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
The ability to discriminate temperature differences depends on whether it is a cooling or heating pulse, the skin temperature, the duration of the temperature stimulus, age, bodily location among other factors. Unfortunately I cannot access the primary literature other than a few isolated smaller studies. However, <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Thermal_touch"" rel=""nofollow"">Scholarpedia</a> has a very nice entry and associated references, and I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thermal sensory system is extremely sensitive to very small changes in temperature and on the hairless skin at the base of the thumb, people can perceive a difference of <strong>0.02-0.07 °C</strong> in the amplitudes of two cooling pulses or <strong>0.03-0.09 °C</strong> of two warming pulses delivered to the hand. The threshold for detecting a change in skin temperature is larger than the threshold for discriminating between two cooling or warming pulses delivered to the skin. When the skin at the base of the thumb is at 33 °C, the threshold for detecting an increase in temperature is <strong>0.20 °C</strong> and is <strong>0.11 °C</strong> for detecting a decrease in temperature.</p>
  
  <p>The rate that skin temperature changes influences how readily people can detect the change in temperature. If the temperature changes very slowly, for example at a rate of less than 0.5 °C per minute, then a person can be unaware of a 4-5 °C change in temperature, provided that the temperature of the skin remains within the neutral thermal region of 30-36 °C. If the temperature changes more rapidly, such as at 0.1 °C/s, then small decreases and increases in skin temperature are detected. [...] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You also were interested in the palmar skin: here average difference limens are 0.02 - 0.06 °C, dependent on the temperature step used. These values were obtained using cooling pulses. In other words, differences in two cooling pulses of 0.02 - 0.06 °C were discernible, with higher limens needed for higher pulses. Baseline temperatures (29 - 39 °C) had little effect (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v69/n1/abs/5616722a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Darian-Smith et al., 1977</a>).   </p>

","<p><strong>General Entry Books to Population Genetics</strong></p>

<p>There are several books that offer an introduction to population genetics. I read <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0878933085"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Principles of Population Genetics (Hartl &amp; Clarke)</a>. I appreciated it but if I were you I think I would rather try <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0981519423"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Elements of population genetics (Charlesworth)</a> or <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1405132779"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Population Genetics (Hamilton)</a>. There is also <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0763757373"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Genetics of Populations (Hedrick)</a>. I would tend to think that this last book presents lots of empirical population genetics data and doesn't take as much focus as the others in theoretical concepts (but I might be wrong). Gillespie's book <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0801880092"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Population Genetics: A Concise Guide</a> is a classic. It is short, very easy to follow and pleasant to read. Gillespie's book might eventually be a little bit outdated but I would still highly recommend it.</p>

<p><strong>Emphasis on Analytical Modelling</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0691123446"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Biologist's guide to mathematical modelling in evolution and ecology (Otto and Day)</a> is a very good and very accessible book. It makes a good review about all subjects that are usually taught to first year students in Biology such as linear algebra for example. It is highly accessible and in the meantime it goes pretty far as it ends up talking about the application of diffusion equation in population genetics (Kimura's work among others). This book presents some important models in population genetics but as it aims to provide the tools for mathematical modelling in ecology and evolution it may under-considerate some fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. For example, the book does not talk about population structure nor about evolutionary game theory and there is little about Coalescent theory.</p>

<p><strong>Other books treating specific subjects within population genetics</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0974707759"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coalescent Theory: an Introduction (John Wakeley)</a> is a good book. I haven't read it completely for both time issues and because the math are a bit complicated for me. Coalescent theory offers a very important set of mathematical tools in evolutionary biology.</p>

<p>There's also <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0387201912"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mathematical population genetics (Ewens)</a>. I am currently reading it. It is definitely not an introductory book and it really doesn't cover much of the most common fields in population genetics.</p>

<p>If you are particularly interested in age-structured population, <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521459672"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Evolution in age-structured populations (Charlesworth)</a> is a very good book.</p>

<p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B005OKYTXU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Modeling evolution (Roff)</a> offers some discussion on how to mathematically define fitness from phenotypic traits.

"What is the difference between a circular and a cat's-eye (slit) pupil?","4178","","<p>I've been to local zoo the other day and one lizard caught my attention: its pupils are circular, which, I thought, is not usual for reptiles. Turns out it is, but now I can't find any explanation on why some animals have one kind of pupil and others have the other. Lizards can have both, and so can snakes. The only difference I have found is that circular pupil can't shrink quite as much as a cat's-eye pupil, but that hardly explains why circular pupil even evolved in the first place as I don't see any advantage to it. </p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

<p>P. S. Fish only have circular pupils so that shape is older, right?..</p>
","<p>Circular pupils are <em>always</em> functionally superior to vertical pupils; a slit does not correctly focus light from all directions whereas a circular pupil does. If you observe cats when they're hunting at dawn and dusk*, they have big, circular pupils; it's only when they're in bright light that the pupil shrinks to a slit. So why have vertical pupils at all? Because, as you mention they're capable of letting a more controlled range of light into the eye.</p>

<p>Thus vertical slits let you be active in a wider range of light conditions at the cost of poorer vision in bright light; whilst circular pupils continue to function well in brighter light but at the cost of not allowing such a large range of control over the amount of light entering the eye.</p>

<p>It is then easy to see why you get both kinds of pupil: circular pupils are favoured by animals that are typically active in bright light and need good vision under these circumstances; vertical pupils are favoured by animals that are primarily active in low light but need some ability to see in bright light.</p>

<p>*- it's often stated that cats are nocturnal, this is untrue; cats are <em>crepuscular</em> - that is they are most active at dawn and dusk.</p>

"Why do humans have only two nipples?","4175","","<p>If other animals have more than 2 nipples, then why do humans have only 2 nipples? </p>

","<p>Questions of the type, ""why does organism X have feature A?"" invite teleological (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story"">just so</a>) explanations which are difficult to substantiate. For example, the number of teats on a cow are difficult to explain in terms of providing milk to humans!</p>

<p>We should look to evolutionary history to explain human traits, not ""just so"" stories. The simple answer is that humans are primates, and primates have similar bodies and lifestyles. If there's a single pressure that lead to the number of teats in primates, it's likely the arboreal niche, not the mean litter size. Indeed, litter size is <a href=""http://www.int-res.com/articles/esr2009/8/n008p201.pdf"">usually a plastic trait</a>, even in primates, and is certainly not an accurate predictor of the number of teats. </p>

<p>There are no strict restrictions on nipple numbers in humans; they can occur <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_line"">anywhere on the milk line.</a> So humans <em>tend</em> to have two nipples because that's what primates <em>tend</em> to have, because of our evolutionary history.</p>

"How does protein denaturation work?","4139","","<p>I was wondering how protein denaturation works.</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there covalent bonds, such as disulfide bridges involved, or is it based purely on non-covalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds? Why is denaturation irreversible in most cases if only non-covalent bonds are involved?</li>
<li>Is it possible to denature protein by rapid changes in electromagnetic field or pressure? (The articles I have read so far mention only stress factors like sudden pH, osmolarity, temperature changes...)</li>
<li>How can I protect a protein against denaturation? e.g. in PCR we use a heat resistant DNA polymerase, so certain amino acid sequences might protect against heat denaturation, but I need reassurance about this.</li>
</ol>
","<p>I investigated the topic too, so here is my answer.</p>

<p>To understand thermodinamic stability of water solved globulins or membrane proteins (all of them proteins hereafter) we have to understand protein folding. Proteins have a 3d structure (composed by their primary, secondary and tertiary structures). The structure of the proteins is constantly changing between the folded and unfolded states. The folded state has a lower free energy while the unfolded state has a higher. Between them there is a free energy barrier which determines the speed of the folding on a specific temperature. </p>

<p>Changing structural on environmental factors can affect these free energies and can shift the equilibrium to the unfolded state. The unfolded protein can suffer irreversible changes (aggregation, disulphide exchange, proteolysis, irreversible subunit dissociation, chemical degradation, etc...), so the denaturation of the protein can be reversible or irreversible.</p>

<p>Note that this is a very simplistic view, I think there are different degrees of unfoldedness, and so different things can happen when the protein is in one of these. For instance by a low degree of unfoldedness misfolding can happen which results a stable, but inactive folded state without coagulation (this can be more or less reversible). By a higher degree of unfoldedness coagulation can happen.</p>

<p>Folding mostly depends on one simple rule: all of the hydrogen bonds have to be satisfied, because a non-satisfied hydrogen bond has a very high energetic cost. The proteins have polar surfaces, which form hydrogen bonds with the water, and one or more apolar center, which have inner hydrogen bonds as backbones. Burial of an unpaired polar amino-acid (e.g. non-satisfied hydrogen bond) is very destabilizing and so it is non-existent in natural working proteins. Other factors, like salt bridges, aromatic-aromatic interactions, disulphide bonds, etc... can affect the stability as well, but hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions are the major factors. The weights of these two major factors is most likely protein dependent (a study suggested 75% and 25%, while another 40% and 60%).</p>

<p>The backbone hydrogen bonds are usually most stable around room temperature, so the lowest free energy and the maximum stability is around 20°C by most proteins and both heating and cooling lowers the stability and can lead to denaturation. High temperatures (>80°C) can cause covalent degradation, and so irreversible denaturation. Pressure has similar effect on the hydrogen bonds and the stability as cold denaturation. </p>

<p>The osmolyte cosolvents like urea or TMAO contribute differently to the free energy of the folded and unfolded states and so shift the equilibrium between them. for example urea can cause denaturation, while TMAO protects the protein from denaturation. I think it is evident that changing pH and saltiness has strong effect on the charges of the amino acid side chains, and so the hydrogen bonds and the stability.</p>

<p>Both ultrasound and pulsed electric field (PEF) can cause denaturation. The effect seems strongly depending on the parameters of ultrasound/PEF and the type of the protein. Interesting that PEF can increase the enzyme activity too. It is hard to find studies about the denaturation mechanisms by these methods.</p>

<p>If we want to increase the protein stability, the method we choose can depend on what we want to protect the protein from. One or more methods from the following list can help to increase the stability:</p>

<ul>
<li>increase of compactness and better packing (minimalization of surface/volume ratio)</li>
<li>increase of electrostatic interactions (formation of additional ion pairs, e.g. more glutamic acid)</li>
<li>additional hydrogen bonds</li>
<li>additional disulphide bridges</li>
<li>increasing hydrophobic interactions (greater proportion of buried hydrophobic residues)</li>
<li>change protein microenvironment (use osmolytes, change pH, saltiness)</li>
<li>glycosylate the protein surface</li>
<li>decrease chain length</li>
<li>change surface amino-acids (the effect can be completely unpredictable, but there are surface residue patterns with known effect on stability; add more ionisable amino acids to the surface; bury hydrophobic residues; etc...)</li>
<li>protein fixation can change the stability as well</li>
</ul>

  <p>Thermodynamic stability of a protein that unfolds and refolds rapidly,
  reversibly, cooperatively, and with a simple, two-state mechanism. The
  easiest proteins in which to study folding and stability are those
  that exhibit this sort of rapid reversibility. Both experimental
  design and also theoretical treatment of data are simplified by
  reversible systems. Thus, it is no surprise that most of the
  literature reports about stability discuss this type of reversible
  system. The stability of the protein is simply the difference in Gibbs
  free energy, dG, between the folded and the unfolded states. The only
  factors affecting stability are the relative free energies of the
  folded (Gf) and the unfolded (Gu) states. The larger and more positive
  Gu, the more stable is the protein to denaturation.</p>
  
  <p>If a protein unfolds reversibly it may be fully unfolded and inactive
  at high temperatures, but once it cools to room temperature, it will
  refold and fully recover activity. In the case of irreversible or
  slowly unfolding proteins, it is kinetic stability or the rate of
  unfolding that is important. A protein that is kinetically stable will
  unfold more slowly than a kinetically unstable protein. In a
  kinetically stable protein, a large free energy barrier to unfolding
  is required and the factors affecting stability are the relative free
  energies of the folded (Gf) and the transition state (Gts) for the
  first committed step on the unfolding pathway. Irreversible loss of
  protein folded structure is represented by: F &lt;-> U -> I, where I is
  inactive due to aggregation, disulphide exchange, proteolysis,
  irreversible subunit dissociation, chemical degradation, etc...</p>

  <p>Evidence from proteins and peptides supports the conclusion that
  intrapeptide hydrogen bonds stabilize the folded form of proteins.
  Paradoxically, evidence from small molecules supports the opposite
  conclusion, that intrapeptide hydrogen bonds are less favorable than
  peptide–water hydrogen bonds. A related issue—often lost in this
  debate about comparing peptide–peptide to peptide– water hydrogen
  bonds—involves the energetic cost of an unsatisfied hydrogen bond.
  Here, experiment and theory agree that breaking a hydrogen bond costs
  between 5 and 6 kcal/mol. Accordingly, the likelihood of finding an
  unsatisfied hydrogen bond in a protein is insignificant. This
  realization establishes a powerful rule for evaluating protein
  conformations.</p>
  
  <p>In their description of the alpha-helix, Pauling et al. (1951)
  asserted that the energy of the peptide N–H• • •O=C hydrogen bond was
  of order -8 kcal/mol, and that “such instability would result from the
  failure to form these bonds that we may be confident of their
  presence.” Pauling’s earlier estimate of the total protein hydrogen
  bond energy was -5 kcal/mol (Mirsky and Pauling 1936). From solution
  studies of urea dimers, Schellman estimated that an intrapeptide
  hydrogen bond would be enthalpically favored over a peptide–water
  hydrogen bond by ~1.5 kcal/mol (Schellman 1955). These and similar
  early studies led to the conclusion that the peptide hydrogen bond is
  a significant factor in stabilizing protein conformations.</p>
  
  <p>This view was to change dramatically following a famous review by
  Kauzmann (1959), who invoked the thermodynamics of small model
  compounds to argue that stabilization of the folded state of a protein
  is due almost exclusively to the hydrophobic effect. Soon after
  Kauzmann’s proposal, Klotz and Franzen (1962) determined that the
  enthalpy of the interamide hydrogen bond of N-methyl acetamide in
  water was zero, and concluded that “the intrinsic stability of
  interpeptide hydrogen bonds in aqueous solution is small.” Similarly,
  hydrogen bonding involving another small molecule,
  epsilon-caprolactam, in dilute solution was shown to be negligible
  (Susi and Ard 1969). Kauzmann’s proposal, bolstered by these later
  studies, led to the widely held view that the hydrophobic effect makes
  the major energetic contribution to protein stability, with hydrogen
  bonds contributing little, or perhaps even opposing, the folding
  process. See Baldwin (2003) for a recent discussion of these issues.</p>
  
  <p>Protein hydrogen bonds are ubiquitous, directional, and largely local,
  partitioning the polypeptide chain into alpha- and 3_10-helices,
  beta-sheet, and beta-turns. Together, these hydrogen-bonded backbone
  structures account for at least 75% of the conformation, on average,
  with remaining residues participating in both additional
  intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hydrogen bonding to water.
  Unsatisfied backbone polar groups are energetically expensive, to the
  degree that they almost never occur. </p>
  
  <p>Force measurements between surfaces functionalized with lipids having
  hydrogen bonding headgroups (NTA, A, T, and MeT lipids) lead to a
  reproducible value of the energy of a single hydrogen bond in pure
  water: ~0.5 kcal/mol. It shows that it is energetically more favorable
  for the headgroups to make hydrogen bonds with each other than to make
  hydrogen bonds with water molecules. This is coherent with past
  studies made on proteins stability, which showed that intramolecular
  hydrogen bonds in a folded protein are energetically more favorable
  than bonds with water molecules in an unfolded protein with an average
  stabilization of ~1 kcal/mol per intramolecular hydrogen bond.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main determinant of cold denaturation tendency is likely the
  stability decrease of backbone hydrogen bonds at low temperatures,
  which in turn is affected by the packing manner of the hydrophobic
  core cluster</p>
  
  <p>Using a newly developed pressure cell, we have now mapped pressure-
  and temperature-dependent changes of 31 hydrogen bonds in ubiquitin by
  measuring HBCs with very high precision. Short-range hydrogen bonds
  are only moderately perturbed, but many hydrogen bonds with large
  sequence separations (high contact order) show greater changes. In
  contrast, other high-contact-order hydrogen bonds remain virtually
  unaffected.</p>
  
  <p>We study the stability of globular proteins as a function of
  temperature and pressure through NPT simulations of a coarse-grained
  model. We reproduce the elliptical stability of proteins and highlight
  a unifying microscopic mechanism for pressure and cold denaturations.
  The mechanism involves the solvation of nonpolar residues with a thin
  layer of water. These solvated states have lower volume and lower
  hydrogen-bond energy compared to other conformations of nonpolar
  solutes. Hence, these solvated states are favorable at high pressure
  and low temperature, and they facilitate protein unfolding under these
  thermodynamical conditions.</p>
  
  <p>We further find that it is the changes in hydrophobic hydration with
  decreasing temperature that drive cold unfolding and that the overall
  process is enthalpically driven, whereas heat denaturation is
  entropically driven.</p>
  
  <p>As a consequence of a weaker penetration upon pressurizing, it was
  found that the pressure-denatured state was partially unfolded
  compared with the heat-denatured state. The mechanism of pressure
  denaturation was related to the disruption of the hydrogen-bond
  network of water onto a set of clusters characterized by strengthened
  O – H interactions, inducing a hardening of protein dynamics. The
  mechanism is opposite to that observed upon heating, i.e., the
  softening of the hydrogen bond network of water inducing a softer
  protein dynamics.</p>
  
  <p>We can conclude that the main driving force of protein denaturation at
  high pressures is the decrease of the hydrophobic effect as a
  consequence of the changes in water structure, without contradicting
  any of the current theories on the hydrophobic effect.</p>
  
  <p>For the pressure denaturation the weakening of the hydrophobic
  interaction between the bulky side chains is found to be crucial at
  lower temperatures, leading to an apparent destabilization of the
  folded backbone structure at elevated pressures.</p>

  <p>The results obtained with the different experimental protocols
  indicate, however, that the conformational equilibrium of GrpE is
  insensitive to electromagnetic fields in the tested range of frequency
  and field strength. </p>
  
  <p>Effects of pulsed electric fields (PEF) treatment (0–547 µs and 0–40
  kV/cm) on physicochemical properties of soybean protein isolates (SPI)
  were studied. Solubility, surface free sulfhydryls (SHF) and
  hydrophobicity of SPI dispersions (20 mg/ml) increased with the
  increment of the PEF strength and treatment time at constant pulse
  width 2 µs, pulse frequency 500 pulse per second (pps) and sample flow
  rate (1 ml/s). When the PEF strength and treatment time were above 30
  kV/cm and 288 µs, solubility, surface SHF, and hydrophobicity of SPI
  decreased due to denaturation and aggregation of SPI by hydrophobic
  interactions and disulfide bonds. Size-exclusion chromatography and
  laser light scattering analyses demonstrated further that stronger PEF
  treatment-induced dissociation, denaturation and reaggregation of SPI.
  Circular dichroism analysis showed that PEF treatment did not produce
  significant secondary structure changes of SPI.</p>
  
  <p>A compact and low cost bench-top, pulsed electric field treatment
  system was designed and developed. The unit consisted of a
  high-voltage pulse generator (? 30 kV) and a treatment chamber with ?
  148 ml capacity. Over the set-up voltage range of 4–26 kV, 30 pulses
  (with instant charge reversal) were applied to eight different enzyme
  solutions using a 0.3-cm electrode distance, a 13–87 kV/cm field,
  0.5-Hz pulse frequency, 2-µs pulse width and 20 °C process temperature. For some enzymes, activities were reduced after the pulse
  treatments: lipase, glucose oxidase and heat-stable ?-amylase
  exhibited a vast reduction of 70–85%; peroxidase and polyphenol
  oxidase showed a moderate 30–40% reduction whereas alkaline
  phosphatase only displayed a slight 5% reduction under the conditions
  employed. On the other hand, the enzyme activities of lysozyme and
  pepsin were increased under a certain range of voltages. Electric
  pulse profile (instant charge reversal) played a very important role
  in reducing the activities of various enzymes.</p>
  
  <p>Effects of high-voltage pulsed electric field (PEF) on native or
  thermal denatured enzyme activities were studied. When PEF was applied
  to various native enzymes, 105–120% of initial enzyme activities were
  observed after PEF treatment. It was suggested that an activation of
  enzyme would be possible by PEF treatment. We attempted a refolding of
  thermal denatured enzyme by using PEF. When PEF was applied to
  denatured peroxidase, enzyme refolding was accelerated in PEF and 60%
  of initial activity was observed after 12 kV/cm and 30 s of PEF
  treatment although spontaneous refolding of this enzyme resulted in
  40% of initial activity. On the other hand, when PEF was applied to
  thermal denatured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), further PEF-induced
  inactivation was observed. It was suggested that the influence of PEF
  is dependent on the type of enzyme.</p>

  <p>In halophiles, protein stability and function are maintained by
  increased ion binding and glutamic acid content, both allowing the
  protein inventory to compete for water at high salt. Acidophiles and
  alkalophiles show neutral intracellular pH; proteins facing the
  outside extremes of pH possess anomalously high contents in ionizable
  amino acids. </p>
  
  <p>These facts suggest that globular proteins should be maximally stable
  around room temperature. Twenty-six of these are unique, and 20 of the
  26 are maximally stable around room temperature irrespective of their
  structural properties, the melting temperature, or the living
  temperatures of their source organisms. Their average temperature of
  maximal stability is 293 ± 8 K (20 ± 8 °C).   The average energetic
  contribution of the individual amino acids toward protein stability
  decreases with an increase in protein size.</p>
  
  <p>Analysed in terms of their effect on the protein structure, the ways
  in which thermophilic organisms obtain relative stabilization of their
  proteins can be classified as follows:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>increase of compactness and better packing</li>
  <li>increase of electrostatic interactions</li>
  <li>additional hydrogen bonds</li>
  <li>additional disulphide bridges</li>
  <li>increasing hydrophobic interactions</li>
  <li>protein microenvironment</li>
  <li>glycosylation</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The rational modification of protein stability is an important goal of
  protein design. Protein surface electrostatic interactions are not
  evolutionarily optimized for stability and are an attractive target
  for the rational redesign of proteins. We show that surface charge
  mutants can exert stabilizing effects in distinct and unanticipated
  ways, including ones that are not predicted by existing methods, even
  when only solvent-exposed sites are targeted. Individual mutation of
  three solvent-exposed lysines in the villin headpiece subdomain
  significantly stabilizes the protein, but the mechanism of
  stabilization is very different in each case. One mutation
  destabilizes native-state electrostatic interactions but has a larger
  destabilizing effect on the denatured state, a second removes the
  desolvation penalty paid by the charged residue, whereas the third
  introduces unanticipated native-state interactions but does not alter
  electrostatics. Our results show that even seemingly intuitive
  mutations can exert their effects through unforeseen and complex
  interactions.</p>
  
  <p>These results suggest that surface charge-charge interactions are
  important for protein stability and that rational optimization of
  charge-charge interactions on the protein surface can be a viable
  strategy for enhancing protein stability. </p>
  
  <p>We have discovered a novel property of single-walled carbon nanotubes
  (SWNTs)their ability to stabilize proteins at elevated temperatures
  and in organic solvents to a greater extent than conventional flat
  supports. Experimental results and theoretical analysis reveal that
  the stabilization results from the curvature of SWNTs, which
  suppresses unfavorable protein-protein lateral interactions. Our
  results also indicate that the phenomenon is not unique to SWNTs but
  could be extended to other nanomaterials. The protein-nanotube
  conjugates represent a new generation of active and stable catalytic
  materials with potential use in biosensors, diagnostics, and bioactive
  films and other hybrid materials that integrate biotic and abiotic
  components. </p>
  
  <p>The main chain to side chain salt bridge between the N-terminus and
  Glu 14 was, however, found to stabilize PFRD-XC4 by 1.5 kcal mol-1.
  The entropic cost of making a surface salt bridge involving the
  protein's backbone is reduced, since the backbone has already been
  immobilized upon protein folding.</p>

"Rust on kettle dangerous to consume?","4138","","<p>I recently traveled to Japan, where I picked up a cast-iron kettle known as a tetsubin. When I opened it up, I found that the inside was heavily rusted. Rust is a result of various combinations of $\ce{Fe^2+}$ and $\ce{Fe^3+}$ bonded to different combinations of oxygens and hydroxides. Would it be safe to drink water boiled in this kettle? I know that Iron is a dietary supplement, but I am not sure in what form our bodies can use iron. Are these oxidation states potentially harmful for the human body? Additionally, is there anything else (such as bacteria) that I should be worried about? I assume that bacteria would be killed since I am boiling the water, though. I am not sure if this question fits withing the scope of the biology stackexchange and if not, where should I post this question? </p>

<p>By the way, I will take full responsibility if I chose to implement any suggestion on this page. If I were to blame anyone else for their free advice, that would make me a <a href=""https://github.com/evantahler/Dont-be-a-Jerk"" rel=""nofollow"">jerk</a>.</p>
","<p><strong>Background</strong>:</p>

<p>Iron exists in a wide range of oxidation states, −2 to +6, although +2 and +3 are the most common.</p>

<p><strong>How is Iron Handled by the Body:</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron#Biochemistry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After uptake in human cells, iron storage is carefully regulated; iron ions are never ""free"". This is because free iron ions have a high potential for biological toxicity. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Performed by the protein <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Transferrin</a> that traps the Fe$^{3+}$ ions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>has such a high stability constant that it is very effective at taking up Fe3+ ions even from the most stable complexes. </p></li>
<li><p>At the bone marrow, transferrin is reduced from Fe$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$ and stored as ferritin to be incorporated into hemoglobin.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dangers of Iron</strong>:</p>

<p>A number of sources reference toxicity and dangers of iron:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. Institute of Medicine indicates that Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (known as ULs) for iron is 45 mg/day. [<a href=""https://www.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fnic_uploads//290-393_150.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>]. </p>

<ul>
<li>Note: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tolerable upper intake level</a> (UL) is the highest level of daily nutrient consumption that is considered to be safe for, and cause no side effects in, 97.5% of healthy individuals in each life-stage and sex group. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <a href=""http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/iron.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">World Health Organization (2003)</a> suggests:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The average lethal dose of iron is 200–250 mg/kg of body weight, but death has occurred following the ingestion of doses as low as 40 mg/kg of body weight </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Of course, one can get <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_poisoning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iron poisoning</a> due to an <em>acute</em> overload of Fe.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Toxic effects begin to occur at doses above 10–20 mg/kg of elemental iron. </p></li>
<li><p>Ingestions of more than 50 mg/kg of elemental iron are associated with severe toxicity</p></li>
<li><p>See <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841496/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abhilash et al. (2013)</a> for an example study examining fatail Fe overdoe in adults. </p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Note: inhalation of Iron Oxide dusts is <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pel88/1309-37.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">complicated</a> but potentially <a href=""http://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/1036.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dangerous</a>, but should be of no concern to you.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However, outside of trying to OD on iron supplements, it's not easy to consume that much iron. So even given all tose nasty numbers, I wouldn't be too concerned</p>

<ul>
<li><p>According to 2 citations (Greentree &amp; Hall 1995 and Goyer 1996) in <a href=""http://www.aspcapro.org/sites/pro/files/zn-vetm0206_082-090.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The toxicity of iron, an essential element</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because iron must be ionized to be absorbed, metallic iron  and <strong>iron oxide (rust) are not generally of concern when they are ingested</strong>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Even when iron is heated (and supposedly ionized) very little becomes available for ingestion:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://whatscookingamerica.net/Information/IronCastIron.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This source</a> cites a 1986 study that found that cooking in a cast iron skillet added typically 1-4 mg (though as high as 7 mg) of iron into the food (well below dangerous levels)</p></li>
<li><p>Besides, iron oxide is already present in most drinking water.</p>

<ul>
<li>Concentrations of iron in drinking-water are normally less than 0.3 mg/L [<a href=""http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/iron.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>] and is seldom found at concentrations greater than 10 mg/L or 10 ppm [<a href=""http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/factsheets/ironFS.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>]. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bacteria connection:</strong></p>

<p>There are bacteria associated with rust:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron-oxidizing_bacteria"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Iron-oxidizing bacteria</a> are chemotrophic bacteria that derive the energy by oxidizing dissolved ferrous iron</p>

<ul>
<li>However, these species are aquatic, and are more likely to be found in ground water or well-water. (not living in your kettle). </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What about Tetanus? From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tetanus is often associated with rust, especially rusty nails. Although <strong>rust itself does not cause tetanus</strong>, objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or in places that harbour anaerobic bacteria. Additionally, the rough surface of rusty metal provides a prime habitat for C. tetani endospores to reside in (due to its high surface area), while a nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound.[21]</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>In other words, rust really has nothing directly to do with tetanus, a soil-dwelling species. One might just inconveniently find a sharp, rough rusty item in the soil to introduce the soil-living species into their bodies.(again, it shouldn't be a concern in your case).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> <em>Would it be safe to drink water boiled in this kettle?</em></p>

<p>Almost certainly. But if you're concerned about it, just sand off the rust and  boil it to kill off anything that <em>might</em> be living there (more likely from old food/drink residues). Otherwise, get yourself a new kettle :p. </p>

"Examples of animals with different number of chromosomes that can interbreed?","4132","","<p>When I was first started to write this question, I wanted to know how species evolve to have a different chromosomal arrangement, such as having two pairs of chromosomes instead of one? However, I think I have resolved my misunderstanding by reading:
<a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/21/basics-how-can-chromosome-numb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/21/basics-how-can-chromosome-numb/</a></p>

<p>My basic misunderstanding was that I thought animals with a different number of chromosomes couldn't reproduce, which appears to be wrong. My question is now, are there examples of animals that can interbreed that have a different number of chromosomes (particularly offspring that are not sterile)? Is there a species that is known to have a variation in the number of chromosomes (yet, somehow, hasn't yet resulted in complete speciation); or are there two species that can be interbred and result in fertile offspring?</p>
","<p>Such examples are not that rare: multiple species are polymorphic for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_chromosome"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">supernumerary (B-chromosomes)</a>, others are known to show intra-specific Robertsonian polymorphism (fusions of acrocentric/separation of metacentric chromosomes).</p>

<p>One very well studied example, which covers both intra- and inter-specific crossings, are isopod crustaceans from the Jaera albifrons complex. They show Robertsonian variation (and additionally sometimes B-chromosomes):</p>

<ul>
<li>different species in the same location normally have different chromosomal numbers;</li>
<li>on the macrogeographical level at least some species show certain gradients in chromosomal numbers;</li>
<li>sometimes the same variation can be observed on the level of local populations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hybrids <strong>between species</strong> are viable and not sterile, but rare in nature. Fecundity of hybrids is lower than that of the parental species, and this seems to serve as an additional post-zygotic mechanism of species isolation.</p>

<p>Crossings between specimens of <strong>the same species</strong> with different numbers of chromosomes do occur in mixed populations and are also possible for parents coming from different extremities of the above mentioned chromosomal cline. In the case of mixed populations frequency of these hetezygotes is less than expected by Hardy-Weinberg. Such offspring is fertile, and its lowered frequency is associated with higher incidence of abnormal meiosis.</p>

<p>On the cytological level (normal) meiosis in a heterozygote individual is remarkable in showing trivalents instead of bivalents for the polymorphic chromosomes:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1u5NQ.png"" alt=""Autosomal trivalent in Jaera albifrons""></p>

<p>(a metaphase with a trivalent in the center and two bivalents) (from Staiger &amp; Bocquet 1956)</p>

<p>In addition, in four out of five species of the complex chromosomal sex determination is of the following uncommon type: males are homogametic with sex chromosomes ZZ, while females are heterogametic with ZW<sub>1</sub>W<sub>2</sub> chromosomes. So, females normally have in total an odd number of chromosomes and in their meiosis one observes a trivalent similar to the one shown above: the metacentric Z-chromosome conjugates with the two acrocentrix W-chromosomes.</p>

"How do RBCs survive without a nucleus?","4112","","<p>So, I was reading this question</p>

<p><a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1037/why-do-mammalian-red-blood-cells-lack-a-nucleus"">Why do mammalian red blood cells lack a nucleus?</a></p>

<p>Now, I do not yet have the privilege to post a comment and so I am forced to create a new question to clear my doubt.</p>

<p>So, according to my understanding, a nucleus is the cell's control center(like the brain). All the functions in the cell are carried out according to  the nucleus's command.</p>

<p>Then how can an RBC survive <strong>without</strong> a nucleus? Why does it still perform all the functions correctly without the nucleus?</p>
","<p>As explained in the previous answer, the RBC loses its nucleus only at maturity. The nucleus contains the DNA and which can in turn produce protein. No nucleus means - no protein/ mRNA synthesis. Also, obviously, the cell loses its capability to divide. </p>

<p>Hemoglobin too is a protein. Knowing that it would lose its nucleus, hemoglobin is synthesized in the precursor stages of RBC. A mature RBC can not synthesize new Hb. Hence, the RBC keeps ready its store of enzymes and structural proteins (not only Hb, all proteins it would need for normal functioning) since it can not form new stuff once it has lost its nuclues.</p>

<p>The lack of a nucleus also limits the cell's repair capabilities. So human RBCs are cleared from circulation once they are about 4 months old. Damage (mostly from oxidative stress) to their structural proteins leads to loss in membrane flexibility. Since, the RBC can't replace the stuff, it gets gulped in by macrophages.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the cell doesn't have a nucleus. The loss of a nucleus renders it better oxygen carrying capability. Even platelets donot have a nucleus. There too, enzymes are prepared and stored beforehand. </p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

"Pathophysiology of pink frothy sputum in pulmonary edema","4103","","<p>Pulmonary edema is a condition where fluid <em>leaks</em> into the alveolar spaces. This can be due to to hemodynamic causes like left heart failure and pulmonary venous obstruction or microvascular injury or increased capillary permeability.</p>

<p>Clinically we are taught to differentiate between various types of sputum. The sputum in pulmonary edema is characteristically pink and frothy.</p>

<p>It is important to mention here that the fluid that leaks into the alveolar spaces is a transudate and not blood. Hence it is by no means that the pink is due to blood. Otherwise it would be called <em>hemoptysis</em>.</p>

<p>My question is, why is the sputum pink if blood has no role to play?</p>
","<p>Even though the fluid in pulmonary edema is a transudate, there is blood in it. This is substantiated by the fact that there are microhemorrhages in acute lung congestion and hemosiderin laden macrophages or 'heart failure cells' in long standing pulmonary congestion on histology. These signify that RBCs have escaped the vasculature to enter the tissue (and failed to get back to the blood), while the macrophages have consumed them later on.</p>

<p>Since the blood loss isn't very high, the color is pink rather than red as seen in hemoptysis. </p>

<p>The reason for this is likely due to the significant differences in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures when compared with the rest of the body. In the Lung, one edge of the capillary is up against a single, extremely thin alveolar cell that provides very little pressure to counterbalance the increased forces present in pulmonary edema. Without this inward pressure to stabilize the capillary wall, you end up with a situation in which small ruptures occur at weak points in the AC membrane, unlike elsewhere in the body where pressures are more equalized and change is an osmotic process rather than one of cellular disruption.</p>

<p>Although hemosiderin laden macrophages can be a proof that RBCs leave the vasculature, it is important to note that they can be found in other organs too. One example is the chronic venous congestion of the liver, where the hypoxia (due to congestion) can lead to endothelial damage letting out the RBC, which later get engulfed by macrophages.</p>

"How to get rid of mosquitoes in a small lake","4101","","<p>I own a small lake. Give or take it is about 50 meters wide and 100 meters long (or 160 feet wide, 320 feet long), with a max depth of around 2 meters / 6.5 feet. One third of the lake is surrounded by forest, the rest is grass / small enclaves of tress. The lake absorbes only rainwater from the surrounding residential area. There is a small outlet towards a much larger lake close by. The lake was recently dredge to remove many years of plantlife that had almost turned it into a swamp. </p>

<p>The lake has a large number of mosquitoes. There is also quite many frogs and a few birds that live near the lake. </p>

<p><strong>What can I do to decrease the amount of mosquitoes in the lake?</strong> </p>

<p>For example, can I set up certain nesting boxes that will attract birds or bats that will eat a large number of mosquitoes? </p>

<p>Can I release certain fish that thrive on mosquites?</p>

<p>It is in Scandinavia. </p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>The shorelines are sharp and most of the vegatation has recently been removed. The lake was recently completely emptied and about 2 meters (or more) of vegatation and soil was removed. The lake has previously been contaminated which was cleaned away. I guess this means that a very large part of the ecosystem has been removed, a few fish did manage to survive, but not very many. </p>
","<p>There are a number of environmentally destructive methods that would be effective, including draining the lake, covering the surface with a continuous layer of oil, or adding toxins to the water, but I'm assuming you're looking for a method that will have the minimum possible off-target effect.</p>

<p>Different mosquito species breed in different habitats and are thus susceptible to different control strategies, so good photos of some adults might help, but I'm assuming here that you've correctly identified the lake as the breeding site. If there are any other possible breeding sites in the area please add them to your question.</p>

<p>If the assumptions above are correct then, broadly speaking, your best options are habitat modification or biological control. I'm not going to go into chemical control here since as stated above I assume you want low environmental and financial cost; if this is incorrect let me know.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Habitat modification</strong>: regularly removing
plant growth within the lake and trimming vegetation overhanging the edges will limit the ability of mosquito larvae to escape predators and may have some effect. However, the recent management you describe has
probably gone some way towards this (did you
notice whether the mosquito problem got any better after the plants
were removed?)</li>
<li><strong>Biological control</strong>: introduce predators or parasites into the environment. Plenty of species eat adult mosquitoes but there aren't really any that primarily feed on them (unless they're the only food source available) and many adult mosquitoes will have laid eggs already - the most effective strategy will be to target the immature population. Larvivorous fish have been shown to be effective in many parts of the world, for example fish in the genus <em>Gambusia</em> ('mosquito fish'). I don't know of any that have been shown to be effective and can thrive as far north as Scandinavia, but if you stock the lake with fish (combined with managing vegetation as above) I'd be surprised if you don't see some improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Biological control, part 2</strong>: Use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis_israelensis"">Bti (<em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> var. <em>israelensis</em>)</a>. This is a bacterium that produces toxins which are highly specific to dipterans and don't really affect anything else. You can buy the bacterium in various formulations including sprays, tablets etc. I'm mainly familar with its use for controlling container-breeding mosquitoes, but <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02043.x/abstract"">this paper</a> describes its use in large lakes so should give you some idea of dose required, optimal application method and time to reapplication. </li>

"Are Whales More Intelligent Than Humans?","4089","","<p>Are Whales smarter than Humans? 
Their brain size leads me to think so.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vgcxI.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The ""wiring"" of the brain is more important than the actual size. If only size would matter that basically humans would be rather unintelligent beings ( many many animals have larger head and brain than us). Intelligence is more related to the complexity of the brain (number and size of different brain components) and the number of connections between neurons. We humans are intelligent because we have high complexity compared to our brain size, our brain has more grooves therefore higher surface than a whale brain. So even though whales are quite smart they're not as smart as us.</p>

<p>EDIT: After getting a few comments I felt I need to clarify my answer, so here it comes: as pointed out by user137 humans have much higher brain-to-body size ration than whales and this is very important. What I was trying to explain (yet failed for the first time it seems), that mere physical size / volume is not that important. The level of development and complexity is that matters the most. Many parts of the human brain is found in lower order animals as shown in the image below: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sPhTI.png"" alt=""brain areas""> (taken from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain</a></p>

<p>The surface to volume ratio matters because the higher ratio implies a more complex brain structure. So while whales have a higher surface in absolute value (approx 2-3 times) yet their brain is larger by approx 5-6 times ( lots of comparison data <a href=""https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/facts.html"">here</a>), thus we have higher surface/volume ratio (i left the ratio part out on my original answer). In the accepted answer on the question linked by Bez it is said that more grey matter in frontal lobe correlates with IQ. Now since grey matter is made of neuron bodies and (fewer)axons, this is quite straightfoward --> more neurons = more connections = higher complexity. But all that comparison was made between humans. So brain size differences between different individuals of the same species may contribute to individual qualities. Comparing mere physical brain sizes of different species is not straightforward because of different brain development levels and brain structure.  </p>

"Were there any flying dinosaurs?","4088","","<p>I've seen some articles which came in contradiction with each other.</p>

<p>The first article was talking about flying dinosaurs, dinosaurs with feathers and so on.</p>

<p>A couple of other articles are talking about misconceptions about dinosaurs one of them being that there are no flying dinosaurs but just flying reptiles (from <a href=""http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/dinosaurs-flying-reptiles"">scholastic.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/24071-pterodactyl-pteranodon-flying-dinosaurs.html"">livescience.com</a>).</p>

<p>So, which one is right?
Also if possible please provide a source for argument.</p>

<p>I cannot find the first article again.</p>
","<p>Birds are both flying dinosaurs <em>and</em> flying reptiles. Yes, that's potentially confusing.</p>

<p>To understand the apparent contradiction, you have to understand how modern classification of organisms works (<a href=""http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/clad/clad4.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">phylogenetic systematics</a>). Under the old (Linnean) classification system, Reptilia (reptiles) was an order and Aves (birds) was a separate order. Phylogenetic systematics, which has completely replaced the Linnean system, views all organisms as interrelated in a nested set of <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14877/birds-and-dinosaurs/14878#14878"">monophyletic</a> groups (clades). It's like a set of venn diagrams, where all organisms fall into a giant circle and then successively smaller circles classify more and more specific groups.</p>

<p>The clade Reptilia includes snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and lots of extinct groups, including dinosaurs. So all dinosaurs are reptiles. The clade Dinosauria includes all the extinct dinosaurs (<em>Stegosaurus</em>, <em>Triceratops</em>, sauropods, etc.), including theropod dinosaurs, which include well known dinosaurs like <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> and <em>Allosaurus</em>. Based on a mountain on anatomical evidence, including lots of transitional fossils, living <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_06"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">birds are a sub-group of theropod dinosaurs</a>.</p>

<p>So all birds (Aves) are theropod dinosaurs (Dinosauria: Theropoda). All dinosaurs are reptiles. Therefore, birds are dinosaurs and reptiles. They are just more closely related to dinosaurs than to other reptiles.</p>

<p>The tricky part is that most people have an intuitive idea of what ""reptiles"" and ""dinosaurs"" are. To a systematist, whose job it is to classify organisms, these terms don't mean the same thing as they do to most people. Systematists think about groups like Reptilia and Dinosauria and how those groups are related to one another. So they have no problem saying that birds are dinosaurs <em>and</em> reptiles, because birds are nested within both of those groups.</p>

<h3>A few words about pterosaurs</h3>

<p>Along with birds and bats, pterosaurs are the other clade of vertebrates capable of powered, flapping flight. Pterosaurs fall within Reptilia (and Diapsida and Archosauria) along with Dinosauria, which includes birds. There are a lot of other extinct lineages in the tree that are not shown, e.g., ornithodirans that are not dinosaurs and not pterosaurs. Pterosaurs and birds share anatomical features that all reptiles, diapsids, archosaurs, and ornithodirans have, which is how we know that they are more closely related to each other than to other groups, like crocodiles. But their flight structures evolved independently and are anatomically distinct fro one another. So pterosaurs <em>are</em> flying reptiles but <em>not</em> flying dinosaurs.</p>

"How does blue white screening work in selecting E coli that have taken up a plasmid vector?","4083","","<p>The plasmid vector I am referring to is pCR 2.1 - TOPO. I added the vector to the E coli and plated them up onto LB+amp+X-gal plate, then incubated. After incubation the plates had two types of bacterial culture on them, one white and one blue. </p>

<p>I think that the blue cultures have accepted the plasmid as they are able to grow on ampicillin, so have the ampicillin resistance gene, and are able to convert the X-gal substrate to blue via the lac Z gene. What i'm confused about is the white colonies. If the colonies are able to grow on ampicillin, surely they have accepted the gene because they have the resistance, and surely they should to be able to convert the X-gal?</p>

<p>So why are these not expressing the lac Z gene? Is it that the lac Z gene and ampicillin resistance aren't on the same plasmid, or is it that the lac z gene didn't make it into the plasmid?</p>
","<p>The traditional blue/white screening is set up so that blue colonies are considered negative for the insert, and white colonies are positive for recombinant DNA. The gene responsible is the lacZ gene, or beta-galactosidase. This enzyme converts a synthetic substrate, X-gal, into an insoluble blue compound.</p>

<p>The pCR2.1 TOPO plasmid is a blue/white selection plasmid in which white colonies are considered positive for the insert. The way this works is by inserting the DNA sequence to clone inside the coding region for lacZ. By having any inserted DNA interrupting the sequences of lacZ, so that the enzyme has lost its function (because it is no longer being translated correctly in the bacteria). On the other hand, no insert present means that lacZ is ligated back together, and the entire enzyme is correctly made, and therefore can metabolize the X-gal substrate to form an insoluble blue dye.</p>

"Why would lactate be high in diabetics?","4078","","<p>Why are lactate level high in diabetes? For example, type II diabetes are resistant to insulin.

<p>Alternatively, type I diabetics don't produce insulin, so the ratio insulin/glucagon would always be very low and gluconeogenesis should be stimulated... So I don't understand why lactate levels are high in diabetes... Can someone help me?</p>
","<p>This condition is also known as ""lactic acidosis"" and can be pretty dangerous, since it influences the pH of the blood. 
When we metabolize glucose to produce ATP and NADH it is metabolized finally to pyruvate in a process called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glyolysis</a> (I am not going into detail here since this is nicely explained in the Wikipedia). Pyruvate can then be used further in the body in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconeogenesis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gluconeogenesis</a>, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Citric acid cycle</a> and other pathways. 
If a lot of energy is needed Pyruvate is converted by the pyruvate dehydrogenase into acetyl-CoA. </p>

<p>The problem with diabetes is that the pyruvate dehydrogenase can be inhibited in diabetes. If the body then needs a lot of energy pyruvate will be converted into lactate which is released by the cells into the bloodstream.
Gluconeogenesis cannot be activated since this needs either Pyruvate, Acetyl-CoA or Oxaloacetate as starting material. The other problem with this process is that this happens in the liver and when the glucose is released into the bloodstream, it cannot be taken up by the cells due to the lack of insulin.</p>

<p>The conversion from Pyruvate to Lactate is katalysed by the Lactate dehydrogenase and needs NADH + H+ as a co-factor. The image below is from the Wikipedia article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lactate dehydrogenase</a>.</p>

<p>Now, to meat and bones (<em>Unintended pun; meat...bones...biology hehe</em>), over the last few days I have noticed that after my drink returning to room temperature, it is so much sweeter than it originally tasted.</p>

<p><strong>Drinks</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>Iced Tea (Bubble Tea)</strong> - Just today I had a bubble tea with the smallest amount of sugar possible, it was still too sweet but I stuck with it, and again when it reached room temperature, it was almost unbearably sweet. (No milk)</p></li>

","<p>Generally, cold suppresses sweetness. As an example, consider soft drinks that are usually served cold: they taste sweeter when warm (like you said with your examples of drinks).</p>

<p>There are taste receptors on the surface of our tongue which refer to the proteins TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 which, which bind to the “sweet-tasting” molecules. 
When the molecules bind to the receptors, they trigger a series of actions which increase the number of positively charged potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>) in the cell to which the receptor is attached. In order for the signal to continue along to the brain, the cumulative positive charge of the potassium ions must be high enough to activate a TRPM5 channel into the cell, so that calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) can pass through. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are required for the release of neurotransmitters which send the signal. This channel requires a much lower positive charge for activation when it is warm than when it is cold.</p>

<p>Now if you were to put, e.g., a cold coke into your mouth, it decreases the temperature of the entire tongue and consequently the TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 proteins, and the TRPM5 channel. This will result in it requiring a greater positive charge in order for the signals to travel to the brain. This means overall also less signals are even received by the brain, thus resulting in us perceiving less sweetness.</p>

"How does non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) work?","4067","","<p>I was reading about non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in my molecular biology of the gene textbook but the explanation provided in the text was rather vague to me, and I was not able to understand it completely. I understood that NHEJ can be used as a repair mechanism when double-strand breaks in DNA occur. The two broken ends are then joined together. What I didn't understand is how this is done. The two broken ends won't always have complementary bases so, won't this lead to mismatched bases? How is this problem fixed? I really need a detailed explanation of how NHEJ occurs please.</p>
","<p>Non-homologous end joining indeed induces errors in the affected sequence. But you have to keep in mind, that NHEJ is an emergency repair mechanism which involves a ""repair or die"" chance. If the chromosomal break is not repaired it is not unlikely that the cell will get into apoptosis, or, even worse, develops into a cancer cell. Introducing small errors is a relatively small price compared to this, although this can still disrupt genes or regulatory sequences. For the mechanism have a look onto the figure (from the first reference):</p>

"Do animals get sick from eating dirty food or eating off the floor?","4057","","<p>Humans have very strict tradition of hygiene, such as washing hands before eating, using utensils, and in general keeping as much distance between food and dirt as possible.</p>

<p>At the same time, most animals would eat off the floor or eat food with foreign particles stuck to it ( after being dropped on the floor). Many animals, like cats groom themselves, practically licking off (and swallowing?) dirt off their coats.</p>

<p><strong>Do animals suffer adverse effects, such as indigestion or disease from consuming food that is dirty by human standards?</strong></p>

<p>Or is it something about the human digestive system that cannot handle the same kinds of dirt that animals can?</p>
","<p>I'm sure it varies wildly based on the animal and what they're eating.  In general, if in the course of an animal's natural feeding process it picks up a little dirt, it has evolved to cope with that.  Animal's behaviors and guts have evolved to fit their food source and lifestyle.  For a behavioral example, seals will eat rough rocks to help breakdown bones (and barf them up when they get too smooth).  Guts have evolved symbiotic relationships with microbes that are specifically adapted to the food source, termites have microbes to help them break down wood, whereas we don't have the microbe population to pull that off.  Interesting side note: it was <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100407/full/news.2010.169.html"">found</a> that one of the gut microbes in some Japanese people has gotten a horizontally transferred gene from a bacteria that lives on seaweed, probably helping them break down seaweed.</p>

<p>There could be a problem when the body is challenged with dirt that contains uncommon substances that the body isn't adapted to.  I'm sure if a cat rolled around in soil contaminated with a lot of arsenic it probably wouldn't be doing very well after licking off all the dirt.</p>

<p>This does bring up an interesting current medical hypothesis called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis"">Hygiene Hypothesis</a>.  Basically, these things you are talking about, utensils, antibacterial soap, etc. are all very very recent developments in human evolution.  As a result, proponents of this hypothesis think that our bodies are adapted to challenges by microbes and parasites, and depriving our bodies of that exposure when we are young totally screws up the development of our immune systems.  This would explain why we see a huge increase in allergies and autoimmune diseases in the developed world, our immune systems are totally miscalibrated, and freak out over harmless things like pollen (allergies), or worse, attack self-antigens (anti-insulin antibodies in type I diabetes).  Human children are animals, and baby animals should play in the dirt!</p>

<p>My question is, can you go the other way? Are there mutagens that just do not cause cancer? If they do not exist or are not known to exist, are they even possible?</p>
","<p>All mutagens are potential carcinogens. Unless the mutagen is highly specific to a site. </p>

<p>HPV causes oncogenic transformation of a cell because of certain proteins that it expresses. Its mechanism is directed and specific. Most ""carcinogens"" are non-specific agents. However according to the <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/en/electromagnetic-fields/glossary/ghi/iarc-classification.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">definition</a>, HPV can be called a carcinogen.  Retroviruses can randomly integrate near an oncogene and cause oncogenic transformation (This is a mutation in principle. Not a point mutation though. They can also integrate within a gene and knock it out). Alcohol and estrogen are not carcinogens. A mutated estrogen receptor can lead to cancer. Estrogen is just a signal. Alcohol consumption for a very long time may perhaps play a role in carcinogenesis because of elevated levels of ROS but higher cancer incidence in alcoholics is not observed. </p>

<p>If you consider the new tools developed for site directed mutagenesis, such as ZFN, CRISPR-Cas and TALEN as mutagens then they are not carcinogenic. However the term <em>mutagen</em> is not used for these molecules. Mutagen almost always refers to a molecule that causes random mutagenesis thereby making it a carcinogen. </p>

"Why isn't the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction of the glycolysis pathway irreversible?","4005","","<p>Step 7 of the glycolysis pathway is the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate into 3-phosphoglycerate by the action of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase, resulting in the production of 2 ATP molecules (per glucose). </p>

<p>This reaction has a large negative value of &Delta;G (-18.5 kJ/mol). If reactions having large negative value of &Delta;G are classed as being irreversible, then why is Step 7 of Glycolysis reversible?</p>
","<p>The free energy change that you quote for the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) forward reaction is, of course, the <strong>standard free energy change</strong> (&Delta;G<sup>0</sup>') for the overall reaction. The standard free energy change is defined for all reactants at a concentration of 1M. Note that this value includes the formation of ATP -  the free energy of hydrolysis of 1,3-BPG would be much larger, and some of that energy is 'captured' in the ATP product.</p>

<p>The actual free energy change for the PGK reaction, &Delta;G,  will differ from this value because of the fact that the actual reactant concentrations are very far from the idealised 1M. You can <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis#Free_energy_changes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">find a Table here</a> which compares, for each step in glycolysis, the standard free energy change with a true free energy change, calculated on the basis of cellular conditions in erythrocytes (also shown). You will see that for the PGK step the actual free energy change is 0.09 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> rather than the -18.9 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> that you quote in your question. </p>

<p>You can also see from the Table that there are only two reactions in the glycolytic pathway with large negative values for &Delta;G: those catalysed by phosphofructokinase and by pyruvate kinase. These are of course the two steps that are bypassed in gluconeogenesis because they are essentially irreversible.</p>

<p>So - your reasoning was correct, but it was based on the wrong &Delta;G values.</p>

"Do all Gram negative bacteria cause septic shock?","4002","","<p>Do all Gram negative bacteria cause septic shock? If they don't could they if you attacked them with an antibiotic that could lyse the cell? For example any antibiotic that attacks the cell wall, although I suppose that could be difficult with the gram negative wall, not to many gram negatives are susceptible to a wall attack.</p>
","<p>all Gram negative bacteria can potentially cause septic shock, but septic shock is not limited to Gram negative cell wall lipopolysaccharides. Any infectious agent can cause septic shock, including gram positive and gram negative bacteria, fungi and even viruses (this is quite evident in the recent Ebola outbreak).<sup>[1]</sup> </p>

<p>The causative agents for sepsis/septic shock have evolved. Originally strongly considered to be related to Gram-negative bacteria, that is no longer the case. About 25 years ago, sepsis was considered to be a response to endotoxin thought to be relatively specific for Gram-negative bacteria. That Gram-negative bacteria were the most common causes of sepsis<sup>[2]</sup> resulted in trials that focused on  specific therapies for G negative endotoxins. </p>

<p>It is now recognized that sepsis may occur from bacterial, fungal and viral organisms. More recent epidemiology studies reveal that Gram-positive bacteria have become the most common cause of sepsis in the past 25 years. According to the most recent estimates in sepsis, there are approximately 200,000 cases of Gram-positive sepsis each year, compared with approximately 150,000 cases of Gram-negative sepsis.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

<p>Fungal causes of sepsis have also grown at a rapid pace. Why this occurs may be two-fold: a general increase in nosocomial (hospital acquired) cases of sepsis, and more effective treatment of bacterial infections, thus promoting fungal infections to a more leading role. The increase of fungal nosocomial infections has also shifted away from the common Candida albicans organism to the more recalcitrant torulopsis, glabrata and krusei subspecies.<sup>[4]</sup></p>

<p>So while the Gram negative Lipopolysaccharide or “endotoxin” is unique to Gram negative bacteria, cell components of Gram positive bacteria have been identified that appear to be biologically equivalent to endotoxin in stimulating the inflammatory response associated with sepsis and septic shock. These include a peptidoglycan layer outside the cell membrane of Gram positive bacteria as well as non-peptidoglycan polymers (such as the teichoic acids). They have been shown to stimulate the release of cytokines, specifically tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1.<sup>[5]</sup></p>

These insects often dwell in beds, couches or other upholstered furniture, and they are also known to live in cracks and crevices in walls, behind wallpaper and wood paneling, or under carpeting (Krueger 2000). </p>

<p>They usually feed nocturnally, and in the absence of allergic rashes from their bites, their presence can go unnoticed. The first signs of a bed bug infestation are often the bed bugs themselves or small dark stains bed bugs can leave behind.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/Creatures/urban/bed_bug.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">University of Florida</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The adult bed bug is a broadly flattened, ovoid insect with greatly reduced wings (Schuh and Slater 1995). The leathery, reduced fore wings (hemelytra) are broader than they are long, with a somewhat rectangular appearance. The sides of the pronotum are covered with short, stiff hairs (Furman and Catts 1970). Before feeding, bed bugs are usually brown in color and range from 6 to 9.5 mm in length. After feeding, the body is swollen and red in color (USDA 1976).</p>

<p><strong>Do you have a problem?</strong></p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Certain signs and symptoms suggest the presence of bed bugs; finding the adult insects confirms the diagnosis. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, other than being a nuisance (e.g., having a ""gross"" factor + some skin conditions such as rashes), bed bugs have not been known to transmit dangerous human diseases (e.g., see Dolling 1991 and <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-8019.2009.01246.x/abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kolb et al. 2009</a>)</p>

They point out that there are grooming behaviors such as licking and social behaviors like dogs touching noses in many species even insects.  They note that it is not decided at all whether kissing is learned or from some sort of instinct.

"How many species did Carl Linnaeus classify?","3981","","<p>How many species did Carl Linnaeus (senior) classify?</p>
","<p><strong>More than 13,000.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Plants: >9,000 names</strong>.
In Systema Naturae 10th edition, commonly taken as the starting point of modern taxonomy, Linnaeus is reported to have published around 6,000 plant names (I haven't counted, but Müller-Wille gives 5,900 and Stearn says ""almost 6,000"". The Wikipedia figure of 7,700 may come from a different edition of Systema Naturae).</p>

<p>However, that's just SN10. Luckily, a wonderful source has compiled the names from all of Linnaeus's work:
The <a href=""http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/linnaean-typification/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linnaean Plant Name Typification Project</a> of the Natural History Museum says that Linnaeus published more than 9,000 valid plant names in his life (names that are still valid under current nomenclatural conventions), and they have many of them in a <a href=""http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/linnaean-typification/database/"" rel=""noreferrer"">searchable database</a> with references to where Linnaeus published them.</p>

<p><strong>Animals: >4,200 names</strong>.
For SN10, different authors give 4,236 or 4,378 animal names. Stearn says ""nearly 4,400"", so perhaps he too was unsure. The total number Linnaues described in his life is probably higher, as he did write separate zoological publications like <a href=""http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/100333#page/11/mode/1up"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fauna Svevica</a>, but I couldn't find a source like the project bringing together all of his animal names.</p>

<p>Human being, in the popular culture generally refers to modern humans, called either <em>Homo sapiens</em> or <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>. The existence of the two names will make sense when talking about the Neanderthals. In the term <em>Homo sapiens</em>, <em>Homo</em> indicates the genus and <em>sapiens</em> indicates the species.

<p><strong><em>PPS:</em></strong> While I'm grateful to everyone for the very nice answers I got, I should point out that I'm waiting for an answer which includes references to accept it.</p>
","<p>This is really the most fundamental concept of Cell Biology, so good question. If you look at the size of a any cell from a whale and compare it to the size of any of cells from a mouse, they are in fact quite similar, despite the extreme difference in the overall size of the organisms they are from. There is a reason why cells are small, and it has to do with the fact that they survive based on their ability to absorb enough nutrients from their environment. As a cell gets larger it needs more to survive (because it has a bigger mass). A bigger cell has also has a larger surface area around it (so it can absorb more nutrients).</p>

<p>HOWEVER, there gets to be a point where the mass of the cell is too large for the surface area to compensate for. Mathematically this is shown by what is called the ""surface-area-to-volume ratio"". Basically, it states that as a a sphere gets larger, the volume increases at a higher RATE than the surface area. So there is a reason cells get only so big, the 60's horror movie The Blob was not scientifically accurate, a single-cell that large (the blob) would not have enough surface area to absorb enough nutrients to sustain itself. Taller (or bigger) people have more cells (not bigger ones) than others.</p>

<p>Effects of osmotic pressure can alter cell size slightly.</p>

<p>When you are talking about taller individuals, you are (I think) really meaning larger people, people with a higher mass. And yes, they have more cells.</p>

<p>Another topic of Cell Biology you may want to explore is apoptosis. Let's say you have two individuals both 180 lbs. one of them is 5' tall and the other 7'. Both these individuals have the same number of cells, but the taller one has a higher percentage of them in the superior and inferior regions of the body. It is the process of apoptosis that sculps an organisms shape.</p>

"Is there an advantage to antibacterial soap?","3947","","<p>There are plenty of different hand soaps out there, as well as hand sanitizers. Is there an advantage to soaps that claim that they're antibacterial vs soaps that just say soap?</p>

","<p>Short answer: There is no benefit for their use in households. </p>

<p>Long answer: These soaps (see <a href=""http://www.colgate.com/app/Softsoap/US/EN/Ingredients.cvsp"">here</a> for the complete list) contain the so called quaternary ammonium compounds <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzalkonium_chloride"">Benzalkonium chloride</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetrimonium_chloride"">Cetrimonium chloride</a> which indeed have antimicrobial properties.</p>

<p>While they do not promote resistance to these compounds (see reference 1), their use is still not recommended, as their permanent use might dry out the skin, can cause contact allergies and the products released into the environment are also problematic.</p>

<p>There are two studies, which compared the use of normal soap (which has some antibacterial properties on its own) to antibacterial soaps in household environments and found no differences. See article linked in reference 2 for a summary and references 3 and 4 for details on the studies.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that antibacterial soaps are useless at all, they simply make no sense in households. For hospitals or doctors they are an important tool to protect their patients before operations. But here detailed instructions for how long and how the hands have to be washed are provided. Hand washing is also followed by another disinfection step, which helps with efficiency. But this is very much different from the way people wash their hands at home.

"Why do plants store energy as carbohydrates and not as fats?","3944","","<p>In my introductory biology class, we are learning about biomolecules. The textbook says fats are a more efficient energy store than carbohydrates.</p>

<p>So my question is - why would plants store their energy as carbohydrates and not as fats, if fats are a more efficient energy store?</p>
","<p>There are quite some reasons for why plants prefer carbohydrates for energy storage rather than fats. I will reach some of them one at a time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fat hates water:</strong> By just applying some common sense, one would get to know that fats are hydrophobic, meaning they literally 'hate' water i.e. don't dissolve in water. So, they cannot be transported very easily. On the other hand, most carbohydrates are water-soluble and can be easily transported via phloem fibers. So, plants prefer to use carbohydrate instead of fat. But they <em>can</em> store fat, by converting them into <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lipoproteins</a>, by binding them with <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821027/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fatty-acid binding protein</a>, by storing them as fatty-acids (i.e. with terminal -COOH which makes them a bit water-soluble) or by storing them in special compartments called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaioplast"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">elaioplasts</a>. Yet, as one might assume, this would require more energy intake than using carbohydrates, so plants don't prefer this process too much.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ckF0u.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ckF0u.png"" alt=""types of plastids""></a><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaioplast"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plants don't want to <em>store</em> everything:</strong> Obviously, plants photosynthesize because they need energy, and because they need energy <em>to survive</em>. So, storing every bit of energy would not be very clever, they need some of it handy. Fats are <a href=""http://www.doublexscience.org/biology-explainer-the-big-4-building-blocks-of-life-carbohydrates-fats-proteins-and-nucleic-acids/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">storehouses</a> of energy i.e. they store energy for extreme conditions, when there is no primary energy source left. Under normal conditions, and at night, carbohydrates are the primary energy source.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cells don't let them in:</strong> Plasma membranes are semipermeable, quite a general fact. So, they do not allow large molecules to enter inside. And fats are one of the largest biomolecules (after, obviously, nucleic acids). So they cannot be transported inside or outside cells. You would say 'but cells are the ones which make fats, so they are already inside!' No, that is why there is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phloem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">phloem</a>, because there are cells which don't synthesize them (say, root cells). On the other hand, carbohydrates, being much smaller, can be transported through small channels or even through simple diffusion through the plasma membrane. Also, as already stated, fats are quite hydrophobic, unlike carbohydrates. So, they are, in a sense, repelled by hydrophilic layer of <a href=""https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/structure-and-function-of-plasma-membranes-5/components-and-structure-64/fluid-mosaic-model-327-11464/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cell membrane</a> just like water itself hates it. So, they find it even more difficult to cross plasma membranes because of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane#Permeability"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">combined effect</a> of size and hydrophobicity.</p></li>

"Making the sense of enzyme Km comparisons","3936","","<p>I have encountered comparisons of the Michaelis-menton constant (Km) a few times. Generally speaking if Km of an enzyme is higher, then it's affinity to its substrate is lower. How does this make sense?</p>

<p>Maybe the maximum velocity (Vmax) of higher-Km enzymes is higher? Then of course Km can have a higher value. Because Km is the substrate concentration at half of the Vmax. But I think we cannot determine affinity with Km.</p>
","<p>Since the Michaelis-Menton constant Km is the concentration of substrate at 0.5Vmax, it is an inverse measure of its substrate affinity, because a lower Km indicates that less substrate is needed to reach a certain reaction speed. Hence, a low Km means a high substrate affinity. </p>

<p>Your statement</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Maybe the maximum velocity (Vmax) of higher-Km enzymes is higher? Then of course Km can have a higher value."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>is incorrect. <strong>Km characterizes how steep reaction speed increases with substrate availability</strong>; it does not determine maximum speed.</p>

<p>Lastly, to address your title question, <strong>comparing affinities can make a lot of sense</strong>. For example, consider the case where enzymes catalyzing similar reactions in different species of organisms are compared. Very low Km means optimal use of small substrate levels, while a high Vmax shows optimized reaction speeds. This in turn may tell you something about optimal habitats and evolutionary pressure.</p>

"What is the point of a runny nose during a cold?","3933","","<p>What is the biological purpose of having a runny nose during a cold?</p>

<p>Note, this is a different question than ""<a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1573/what-causes-a-stuffy-or-runny-nose-when-you-have-a-cold"">What causes a runny nose</a>"" and other similar questions. Those question are about the cause, what starts the nose running. This question is about why? What is the body trying to do by making the nose run. </p>

<p>For example a cough, I'm guessing, is to help remove or loosen gunk in the lungs. Tears seem to have a point of cleaning the eyes. Diarrhea seems to have a point of clearing the bowels. Fevers have a point of killing viruses. Vomiting seems to have a point of getting rid of bad things in the stomach. Sweating seems to have a point of cooling the body down.</p>

<p>During a cold though, while reasons like inflammation etc cause a runny nose, what's the point? Why did we evolve to have runny noses during colds? What's the body trying to achieve by giving us a runny nose, specifically during a cold.</p>
","<p><strong>Edited by request for clarity</strong></p>

<p>The biological purpose of a runny nose is to clear pathogens and allergens trapped in the mucus out of the nasal cavity and sinuses as a result of rhinitis or sinusitis. </p>

<ul>
<li>Mucus is considered to be part of the innate immune system and provides mechanical and chemical defenses against pathogens.

<ul>
<li>Mucus acts as a barrier protection that is difficult for pathogens to breach.</li>
<li>Mucus is capable of trapping pathogens in it and when that mucus is swept out of your upper respiratory track through your nose or down your esophagus, the pathogens are removed from those areas as well.</li>
<li>Defensive proteins called Mucins, Lysozymes, and Immunoglobulins are secreted into the mucus and provide additional protection, as they can lyse or opsonize pathogens.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mucus keeps endothelial cells moist so that they do not dehydrate as air passes over them. This in turn keeps endothelial cells healthy so that they maintain a tight cell layer in order to protect the underlying tissue.</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the mechanical defenses against pathogens, endothelial cells are ciliated and they rhythmically sweep mucus from the sinuses and nasal cavity mainly into your esophagus and digestive system, but can also move mucus into your nose. Most of the time we aren't even aware this clearance of mucus is happening and it travels down our esophagus into our stomach's and intestines where it can be excreted from the body. This is the case when you do not have an infection and your mucus is not viscous.</p>

<p>When you have an infection the inflammatory response is triggered by cytokines from macrophages. Those cytokines induce cells in the area to do many things. One is to increase mucus production. This may cause endothelial cells in your nostrils and nasal cavity and sinuses to secrete more mucus as well, and this will be swept away through your nose, where you will notice it as a runny nose. </p>

<p>Usually your nose is runnier with rhinovirus infections or with allergens than it is when you have a bacterial infection where mucous tends to be thicker and more viscous. The ciliated endothelial cells have an easier time moving the thinner mucous of a viral infection or allergy than the thicker mucus of a bacterial infection, so you notice a runny nose more when you have a cold or hay fever.</p>

<p>So in short, the biological purpose of a runny nose is that it is part of the immune response to clear pathogens away and protect your uninfected endothelial cells from being infected. It also clears out much of the debris and inflammatory proteins that are found at the site of the infection so that they do not remain in the area to further inflame tissue that is trying to heal. When you have allergies your immune system reacts inappropriately to a benign substance, and if the allergen finds its way into your nasal cavity, it will generate rhinitis and cause your nose to run.</p>

<p>I would rephrase this to ""Sodium/potassium <em>pumps</em> establish the concentration gradients of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane."" Potassium <em>channels</em> do not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have found evidence in articles supporting the first claim, but I

<p>Right; because the channels don't set up concentration gradients.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do potassium channel blockers affect the resting membrane potential? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they block the resting state ""leak"" potassium channels, you bet. The resting membrane potential is largely set by the electrical conductance through those channels. Blocking them would greatly depolarize the cell compared to typical resting membrane potential values. But there are many different potassium channels. You may be thinking of blocking the delayed rectifier potassium channel, which shouldn't do much at all to change the resting membrane potential.</p>

In the morning, when being on the edge of waking up, I hear the birds, and the tennis balls already being batted on the court nearby, but I do not hear my radio. If I wait a few more minutes, I start to hear the radio, with no changes in the sound levels outside.</p>

<p>I know that the human eye adapts to the light levels (aperture, what cells used), but is there something similar for sound sensitivity?
Note, the radio is on that occasion running all night long, with always the same sound level. </p>
","<p>In  this instance, I would say your attention has been adjusted, not your ear's ability to perceive sound. Our ears don't have a control setting or a means of adjusting incoming sound levels (though I'm certain when an ambulance with loud siren drives by, we all wish we did). </p>

<p>What you are experiencing is a prioritization of the sound by your brain in relationship to other sounds.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You put the sound on before you go to sleep. Your brain accepts that incoming sound as non-vital, non-threatening sound. (Radio, meant to soothe, supposed to be there, relegate this sound to innocuous)</p></li>
<li><p>Come dawn, new and novel sounds appear. For our brains, the new and novel could indicate a threat, so your brain prioritizes that sound over the known and considered innocuous sound (your radio) which it has heard all night. Birds, tennis balls on courts are distinctive enough your brain would prioritize them even though you know in your conscious mind neither is an actual threat.</p></li>
<li><p>As you waken, your brain then reminds you there is still another sound in your environment which is not threatening and yet still prevalent (your radio) prompting you to decide if you want to do anything with the non-threatening sound.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, this is an oversimplification of a very complex process of sound prioritization but most modern science bears this out. As a curiosity, our minds are predisposed to seek out information which may be vital to us, hence the reason conversations held by other people who are on the phone are so distracting because our brains dislike hearing things which may be necessary to our survival but only hearing half of the conversation.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>As I was reminded there are some involuntary control elements built into the ear via:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle""><strong>tensor tympani muscle</strong></a> whose role is to dampen sounds (mainly internal ones such as chewing)</p></li>

<li>HIV infects <strong>CD4+ helper T-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells</strong>, which are responsible for mediating the host immune response.  Thus, it infects specifically the cells we need to fight an infection.</li>
<li>HIV drastically <strong>reduces the number of CD4+ T-cells</strong>.</li>
<li>HIV has a number of viral proteins that <strong>prevent some of the body's antiviral mechanisms</strong></li>
<li>HIV can infect via <strong>cell-free</strong> (large number of particles, low infection rate) or <strong>cell-to-cell</strong> (low number of particles, high infection rate) routes.</li>

<li>It takes time for virus to mutate enough to be infectious again to people who were already infected with it.</li>
<li>The efficacy of the immune system may vary seasonally, say, due to changes in daylight hours/vitamin D and melatonin levels (which have been shown to affect immune system function in hamsters)</li>
<li>Flu is transmitted better in more crowded conditions + in winter people are more crowded together. This is a popular explanation, but the authors claim that it has not been satisfactorily tested. It <em>has</em> been argued convincingly that the 1918 flu epidemic was exacerbated by the crowded condition of army barracks in WWI (see citation in paper).</li>
<li>Indoor heating encourages air recirculation, which allows virus to persist in the air around you longer.</li>
<li>Viruses survive/persist better in cold, dry conditions. This may allow them to spread in the atmosphere longer during the winter, and be more easily transmitted from person to person via ""bioaerosols"" (sneezes).</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, as I said before, we don't really know yet. Reading that list you can imagine several ways in which a few of those factors are not at all causal and are rather just strongly correlated with the ""true"" cause of flu seasonality.</p>

","<p>Just because you have removed the Nitrogen and CO₂ won't help you keep a higher vapour pressure of H₂O in the air.

<p>The only way to have a high enough vapour pressure of H₂O for something like diving would be to heat it, but I don't think a lungful of very hot water vapour would be terribly good for you.</p>

So far I found that there is a specific relation to osmosis. </p>
","<p><strong>Flaccidity in plant cells</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The failure to display turgidity especially as seen with plant cells. 
  The suspension of cells from plants in isotonic solutions results in the state termed flaccidity. On a cellular level it represents a lack of pressure of the plasma membrane against the plant cell wall. A more extreme state, termed plasmolysis, is seen given suspension of cells in a hypertonic solution, i.e., as occurs with bacteria suspended in solutions containing high salt or sugar concentrations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A flaccid cell is one which is in an isotonic solution, this means that the solution and the cell have an equal water conc.. Although there are always water molecules flowing into and out of the cell, they balance each other out. So a cell is referred to as flaccid when it is between being turgid and plasmolysed.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Plasmolysis in plant cells</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, the plant cell loses water and hence turgor pressure by plasmolysis: pressure decreases to the point where the protoplasm of the cell peels away from the cell wall, leaving gaps between the cell wall and the membrane and making the plant cell flaccid.</p>

"Relationship between turgor pressure and osmotic pressure?","3836","","<p>I would like to know if there is a relationship between osmotic pressure (inside and outside of a cell) and turgor pressure. If so, is there a way to formalize it mathematically?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance,<br>
Eorn</p>
","<p>Turgor Pressure(T.P) is defined as the amount of pressure inside a cell solely due to its water content, whereas Osmotic Pressure(Pi) is defined as the pressure required to stop osmotic flow between the cell and a pure solvent when the pressure exerted by water is zero. </p>

<p>Osmotic Pressure is often given as the negative of the Osmotic Potential(or Solute Potential) of the Cell.(Because more the solute, more pressure will be required to stop the osmosis, but against the gradient). (1)</p>

<p>Therefore, it can be easily seen that Osmotic Pressure is solely dependent on the solute concentration of the cell.</p>

<p><strong>The Total Suction Pressure(S.P)</strong> of a Cell is the pressure required outside of a cell to stop the water flow in a pure solvent. </p>

<p>The T.P in such a situation would try to reduce the S.P (More the T.P, less would be the pressure on the outside). Whereas, the O.P in such a situation would try to increase the S.P (More the solute inside a cell, more would the water on the outside try to get on the inside)</p>

<p>Hence, Mathematically (considering no other pressures to be responsible for Total Suction Pressure)</p>

<p><strong>S.P = Pi - T.P</strong></p>

<p>This can Also be proved in the following way:</p>

<p><strong>Water Potential(Psi W):</strong> Total Pressure inside a Cell.</p>

<p><strong>Solute Potential/Osmotic Potential(Psi S):</strong> Reduction in Water Potential Magnitude due to addition of a Solute(solute reduces kinetic energy of water due to bonding)</p>

<p><strong>Pressure Potential(Psi P):</strong> Hydrostatic Pressure, i.e, pressure exerted by the water present inside a cell if there were no solute particles.</p>

<p>By definition</p>

<p><strong>Psi W = Psi S + Psi P</strong></p>

<p>(We know, Psi S = -Pi) As written above in (1)</p>

<p><strong>Psi W = -Pi + Psi P</strong></p>

<p>(We know, Turgor Pressure is the same thing as Psi P)</p>

<p><strong>Psi W = -Pi + T.P</strong></p>

<p>Suction Pressure is the negative of Total Pressure inside a Cell</p>

<p><strong>(S.P = -Psi W)</strong></p>

<p>(Water flows from high water potential to low potential, but from low Suction Pressure to an area of High Suction Pressure)</p>

"How does the Pectoralis Major work when doing a bench press?","3830","","<p>Disclaimer, I'm not a biology undergrad and I only know the basics about muscle movement.</p>

<p>I know that doing a bench press works the chest, and specifically the Pectoralis Major because, well, I feel muscle soreness. However, it is not obvious to me what the Pectoralis Major has to do with extending the arm.</p>

<p>Thinking about muscle contraction, I see clearly how, for example, the Bicep flexes the elbow when it contracts. In a similar way, when the Pectoralis Major contracts you get horizontal shoulder adduction.</p>

<p>But what about the bench press? The majority of the movement consists of raising the arms upwards from a tucked position, and the is little shoulder adduction. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>The pectoralis muscle attaches to the top to the inner half of the clavicle, just underneath the biceps on the inner part of your arm and the breastbone (a.k.a the sternum) which is found in the middle of your ribs. See below: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i6GfZ.jpg"" alt=""Pectoralis major muscle attachments""></p>

<p>So taking that in account the pectoralis muscle helps bring your arm closer to your body (adducts your arm), pulling it forward in front of you (flexes the humerus) to push up like you would when you bench press. This action can be seen below.</p>

"Molecular cause of cramps, spasms and strengthening in muscles? (incl. intro to muscle contraction)","3825","","<p>When motor neurons are stimulated to trigger an action potential, this potential propagates down the spine, eventually reaching a neuromuscular junction, causing the release of acetylcholine (ACh).</p>

<p>ACh binds to nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR) on the muscle fibers, leading to an action potential. The nAChR is a non-selective, ligand-gated ion channel, permeable to sodium-, potassium- and calcium ions. This means sodium ions will flow in, leading to depolarization, but potassium will flow out, working towards hyperpolarization.</p>

<p>If enough of these channels are opened, the post-synaptic membrane potential will be drawn towards $E_{Na}$ enough to reach a threshold, so that voltage-gated sodium channels open on the post-synaptic membrane, causing a post-synaptic action potential.</p>

<p>This action potential travels down inward extrusions of the plasma membrane, called transverse (T) tubules. <strong>Is the membrane continuous along these tubules, or does the tubule just end somewhere inside the muscle fiber?</strong> Anyway, the action potential comes in contact with the muscle fiber version of an endoplasmic reticulum: The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).</p>

<p>Upon contact with the action potential, the calcium ion channels in the SR open, causing calcium ions to flow into the cytosol. Here they bind to troponin complexes on the tropomyosin protein - a regulatory protein, that twists around the thin filaments of the muscle fiber. In short, when calcium ions bind to troponin, it reveals binding sites for myosin on the thin filaments, letting the muscle contraction cycle of the myosin heads proceed, and the muscle contracts!</p>

<p>When the stimulus goes away, calcium ions are transported back into the SR, and myosin has nowhere to bind, thus the cycle is halted, and the muscle relaxes.</p>

","<p>I think a lot of your questions try to split the hair; <em>is this happening at the chemical or the histological level</em> and I do get what you're asking, but you should know that the distinction is often not worth making. Pretty much whenever a neuron's involved, the interesting biology is multi-scale.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Is the membrane continuous along these tubules, or does the tubule just end somewhere inside the muscle fiber?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The membranes are continuous.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>When the muscle is twitching...</strong> is this neurological of nature, or is it related to a molecular cause in the muscle itself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most things you'd call a muscle twitch are at the whole-muscle-group scale, involving the coordinated contraction of many individual motor units, so it's basically neurological.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>When the muscle is cramping...</strong> I'm almost certain this arises in the muscle. What causes it? A malfunction with regard to the calcium ions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <em>muscle cramp</em> is a colloquialism for a couple of things that are quite different from each other. Overall, as with the previous question, if someone's experiencing a muscle cramp that means it's a fairly macroscopic phenomenon and it likely involves a whole group of muscle filaments, so it's neurological. Most spasms and cramps are neurologically mediated. </p>

<p>The connections with electrolyte balances (cramps from low sodium, potassium, magnesium, or calcium) also hint at the neurological basis because neurons act on each other (and on muscles) by forming or dissipating ion gradients. You may know that low dietary calcium can lead to muscle cramps; if this was relevant to the calcium release within the myocyte (from the sarcoplasmic reticulum) then the calcium-starved muscles wouldn't be expected to chronically contract (which requires calcium) but to chronically relax. </p>

<p>That being said, there's a lot of room for feedback mechanisms. So, let's say a person experiences a muscle tear; the tear is small enough that it doesn't compromise the function of the entire muscle group. In this case it's adaptive for the local damage to 'signal' to the rest of the muscle group to initiate spasm so as to stabilize the damaged structures as they're repaired. In this scenario the local damage would 'inform' a neurological (and/or endocrine) response that actually effects the spasm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lastly, and on a slightly different subject, <strong>what are the microlesions in the muscles that occur during strength training, and what is the overcompensation that happens?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last time I was updated on this (not my bag), there were some large questions remaining. The tricks used by growing muscle to establish large, regular arrays of contractile machinery, that is organized over many spatial orders of magnitude, are poorly understood. There are structures that monitor the overall organization and that detect any large deformations. Regarding overcompensation, let's play through a generic scenario. A muscle cell is loaded too much and becomes physically damaged. It has to stop taking orders (stop responding to contraction/relaxation signals) and to initiate repairs. The overcompensation results because muscle cell's not really capable of knowing how large it was before the damage, so the safe amount of repairs to do is <em>extra.</em> Probably there are epigenetic processes that let a muscle cell 'count' the number of times its been greatly damaged and to scale-up the response appropriately.</p>

<p>If you just consider two likely sources of damage -- mechanical strain and lactic acidosis -- you can see that there are widely different mechanisms that would be required to detect the damage and to initiate repairs. </p>

<p>Alternatively is there something <em>special</em> about photons with those energy levels that is leading to stabilising selection in multiple species as diverse as humans and plants?  </p>
","<p>Good question. </p>

<p>If you look at the spectral energy distribution in the accepted answer <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/450"">here</a>, we see that photons with wavelengths less than ~300 nm are absorbed by species such as ozone. Much beyond 750 infrared radiation is largely absorbed by species such as water and carbon dioxide. Therefore the vast majority of solar photons reaching the surface have wavelengths that lie between these two extremes.</p>

<p>Therefore, I would suggest that surface organisms will have adapted to use these wavelengths of light whether it be used in photoreceptors or in photosynthesis since these are the wavelengths available; i.e., organisms have adapted to use these wavelengths of light, rather than these wavelengths being special <em>per se</em> (although in the specific case of photosynthesis there is a photon energy sweet spot).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I couldn't find any detailed descriptions about the alleged evolution of slow worms, whereas for snakes it is easy to find material.</p>
","<p>You are correct that the reason is similar to that of convergent evolution of the eye.</p>

<p>Both snakes and legless lizards are lizards (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamata"" rel=""nofollow"">Squamata</a>) that have lost their legs. <strong>However they have done so entirely separately much as octopus and human eyes have evolved entirely separately.</strong> An easier analogy is between whales and sea cows. Both are legless mammals but as they have evolved separately the must be given separate names.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it seems that the exact position of the snakes in the tree is unknown which makes this explanation less clear.</p>

<p><a href=""http://tolweb.org/Squamata/14933"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tolweb.org/Squamata/14933</a></p>

<p>However, the legless lizards (subfamily Anguinae) are within the family <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anguidae"" rel=""nofollow"">Anguidae</a>, most of which have legs. This family is within the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anguimorpha"" rel=""nofollow"">Anguimorpha</a>, which includes even more species with legs.

On the other side of the tree, separated by many millions of years is the snakes (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake#Biology"" rel=""nofollow"">Serpentes</a>).</p>

<p>A related question is why are snakes given their own name while legless lizards are just considered lizards without legs. This is partially due to the fact that there are so few species of legless lizard while there are thousands of species of snake. It is also probably due to cultural history. As snakes are dangerous to humans and prevalent in most inhabited areas of the world words for snakes are much older than the study of taxonomy.

<p>It seemed most likely that the agent was a virus rather than a bacterium (though every possible angle was covered), and just about every virologist tried looking for their favorite agent, but retroviruses also seemed like logical candidates and several groups tried isolating infectious agents from the blood of AIDS patients.</p>

<p>The two groups who were most successful were those of Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo.  There turned out to be a lot of politics and personalities involved and I won't get into that.  Here are some comments from Montagnier summarizing the story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There were only a few patients with this disease in France, but Gallo's idea that a retrovirus was the cause had already crossed the Atlantic. His idea was disseminated by a small group of clinicians and immunologists led by Jacques Leibowitch and Willy Rozenbaum. At the end of 1982, Françoise Brun-Vezinet, a former student of mine and a member of this group, proposed that we collaborate to discover if a retrovirus was the cause of this disease, now called AIDS. </p>
  
  <p>We were ready to start because my laboratory was equipped to hunt for lymphotropic retroviruses in human T cell cultures.  ... On 3 January 1983, Françoise Brun-Vezinet obtained a lymph node biopsy from one of Rozenbaum's patients, ... I minced the lymph node, dissociated the fragments into single cells, and cultured the T lymphocytes with interleukin-2 and antiserum to human interferon. Fifteen days later, Françoise Sinoussi (by then Barré-Sinoussi) found the first traces of RT in the supernatant of the lymphocyte culture, indicating the presence of a retrovirus.  ... A few months later, I received a blood sample from a young hemophiliac (LOI) with full-blown AIDS, and blood and lymph node samples from a young gay man (LAI) with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma. The LAI virus could be isolated from the patient's blood cells and grew very quickly in the patient's cultured T lymphocytes, killing them as well as killing T lymphocytes from blood donors. </p>
  
  <p>New evidence that this strange retrovirus was the cause of AIDS came from our team in the fall of 1983 and the winter of 1984 (7). We observed a high frequency of antibodies against the virus in lymphadenopathy patients, and noted the favored tropism of this virus for CD4+ T lymphocytes. Our results were still controversial, however, and we had difficulty in obtaining the funding needed to better characterize the virus and to develop a blood test. The tide only turned in France when Robert Gallo and his group in the United States made a similar discovery. In the spring of 1984, Gallo published more convincing evidence that HIV causes AIDS ...</p>

<p><strong>Segmentation inside the citric fruits are due to its development from the ovary, as each of the segment is evolved from the ovary locule, the number of segments varies according to species</strong>(also there are variations in single species). The evolutionary advantage of segmentation inside the fruit is a debated topic.A digestible theory is that, each segment of the fruit contains 1-3(in the case of orange) seeds, due to the evolution by mammalian resources, keeping segments inside the fruits helps in the dispersal of seeds by different agents. When a ripe fruit falls down, its individual segments are broken apart and eaten by different animals/birds, this in turn helps in dispersal of seeds to geographically distinct(distant) locations. <strong>With each segments featuring seeds inside them, its a good adaptation to produce a single fruit which can be distributed by different agents.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do ants really find the shortest path to a food source?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No! But they can find a decent path</p>

<p><strong>Longer answer</strong></p>

<p>Optimization algorithms are used to search through a possibility space that is too large to explore every single possibility. Such algorithms attempt to find a good enough solution, often without necessarily knowing how 'good' the found solution is to the best possible solution. So optimization algorithms don't always find the best solution. Actually, most of the time, they do not find the best path but a good enough one in a reasonable amount of time. </p>

<p>Same holds true for ants. In the analogy, an ant colony is an agent based algorithm where agents leave pheromone trails. The concentration of the pheromone depends upon the length of the trail. By following the trails that smells the strongest and by regularly making small errors (so that they can keep exploring other paths), they end up with a decent solution.

"What is the maximum altitude where humans can survive?","3784","","<p>What is the highest altitude that a human can survive without being pressurized?  Let's assume that oxygen and heat/insulation are not the limiting factors?
<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/24420/can-a-giant-kite-carrying-a-person-fly-around-the-world-by-riding-jet-streams"">Why I asked.</a></p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Between 62,000 and 63,500 feet (18,900 and 19,350 meters) blood begins to boil at body temperature. This altitude, referred to as the Armstrong limit, is generally considered to be the absolute limit compatible with life. At this point, humans cannot survive without pressurization measures.  </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Atmospheric pressure drops at higher altitudes. As you go higher into the atmosphere, gases start to expand due to the lower atmospheric pressure. This is what causes your ears to pop when driving up in the mountains or when an airjet lifts off. At altitudes higher than <strong>10,000 feet</strong> (3.5 km) people unaccustomed to the reduced atmospheric pressure may become <strong>short of breath</strong> or experience <strong>dizziness</strong>. At altitudes above <strong>20,000 ft</strong> (6.1 km) supplemental <strong>oxygen</strong> is required to support life and at <strong>34,000</strong> ft (10.4 km), 100% oxygen is necessary to equal the partial pressure of oxygen in sea level air. Above <strong>40,000</strong> ft (12.2 km), 100% oxygen must be administered pressurized (<strong><a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/research/AirSci/ER-2/pshis.html"">NASA</a></strong>).</p>

<p>Altitudes above <strong>50,000</strong> ft (15.2 km) are considered <strong>near-space</strong> and man requires a pressurized suit to be safe. At <strong>55,000 ft</strong> (16.8 km), atmospheric pressure is so low that <strong><em>water vapor in the body starts to boil at ambient temperatures, causing the skin to inflate</em></strong>. At <strong>63,000 ft</strong> (19.2 km) blood at normal body temperature (98 F / 37<sup>o</sup>C) starts to boil. At altitudes above <strong>65,000 ft</strong> atmospheric pressure approaches that of space, i.e., a vacuum (<strong><a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/research/AirSci/ER-2/pshis.html"">NASA</a></strong>).</p>

<p>Between <strong>62,000 and 63,500 ft</strong> (18.9 - 19.4 km), blood at body temperature (37<sup>o</sup>C) begins to boil. This is the point beyond which humans absolutely cannot survive in an unpressurized environment. This point is named the <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_limit#cite_note-2"">Armstrong limit</a></strong>, after <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_George_Armstrong"">Harry George Armstrong</a>, who founded the U.S. Air Force’s Department of Space Medicine in 1947. On Earth, the Armstrong limit is somewhere between 62,000 and 63,500 feet (18.9 and 19,4 km), or about 12 miles.</p>

<p>As a reference, the highest point on earth is the <a href=""http://earthsky.org/earth/highest-and-lowest-points-on-earth"">peak of the Mt. Everest</a> at 29,000 ft (8,8 km). </p>

<p>Above the Armstrong limit, water in the soft tissues of your body vaporizes, causing gross swelling, though the tight seal of your skin would prevent you from actually bursting apart. Your eyes, likewise, would refrain from exploding, but continued escape of gas and water vapor leads to rapid cooling of the mouth and airways <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/survival-in-space-unprotected-possible/"">(Goslin, 2008)</a>.</p>

<p>Water and dissolved gas in the blood forms bubbles in the major veins, which travel throughout the circulatory system and block blood flow. After about one minute circulation effectively stops. The lack of oxygen to the brain renders you unconscious in less than 15 seconds, eventually killing you. <strong><em>When the pressure gets very low there is just not enough oxygen</em></strong>, which is thought to be the first and most important concern <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/survival-in-space-unprotected-possible/"">(Goslin, 2008)</a>. </p>

<p>Note that under conditions of near-vacuum, death is not instantaneous. At one three-hundred-eightieth of atmospheric pressure at sea level, dogs were shown to survive up to 90 seconds. During their exposure they weren't in a great state (the dogs were bloated, ice covered their tongue, and many more horrible facts to be read in <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/survival-in-space-unprotected-possible/"">(Goslin, 2008)</a>). Monkeys were even shown to cope for 3.5 minutes under these conditions.</p>

"Pros/cons: linear vs. circular DNA","3781","","<p>Why did Eukaryotes evolve to have linear DNA and not circular like Prokaryotes? What are the pros and/or cons?</p>
","<p>This question has been asked before: <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3455/is-there-an-advantage-to-linear-chromosomes"">Is there an advantage to linear chromosomes?</a></p>

<p>Firstly, I should state that the generalisation that ALL prokaryotes have circular genomes is incorrect. A growing number of prokaryotes have been discovered which have linear chromosomes, such as <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> ,which causes Lyme disease, members of the <em>Streptomyces</em> family and <em>Agrobacterium tumafaciens</em>, which has both a circular and a linear chromosome.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the question being asked: </p>

<p>Generally, my feeling is that large circular chromosomes would have much greater supercoiling and related torsional problems, making it difficult to unwind them for transcription, replication or repair. This limitation on physical size limits the amount of genetic information that can be carried in a single chromosome, thereby limiting complexity of the organism.</p>

<p>You could increase the number of circular chromosomes to compensate for their lack of size, but again, you end up having a physical limitation (size of the nucleus or size of the cell for anuclear organisms) on how many chromosomes you can pack into the cell. </p>

<p>Linear chromosomes are just a more efficient shape when it comes to larger sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A wide range of factor VIII and IX levels is observed in heterozygous carriers of hemophilia as well as in noncarriers. In female carriers, extreme lyonization may lead to low clotting factor levels. We studied the effect of heterozygous hemophilia carriership on the occurrence of bleeding symptoms. A postal survey was performed among most of the women who were tested for carriership of hemophilia in the Netherlands before 2001. The questionnaire included items on personal characteristics, characteristics of hemophilia in the affected family members, and carrier testing and history of bleeding problems such as bleeding after tooth extraction, bleeding after tonsillectomy, and other operations. Information on clotting factor levels was obtained from the hospital charts. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation of carrier status and clotting factor levels with the occurrence of hemorrhagic events. In 2004, 766 questionnaires were sent, and 546 women responded (80%). Of these, 274 were carriers of hemophilia A or B. The median clotting factor level of carriers was 0.60 IU/mL (range, 0.05-2.19 IU/mL) compared with 1.02 IU/mL (range, 0.45-3.28 IU/mL) in noncarriers. Clotting factor levels from 0.60 to 0.05 IU/mL were increasingly associated with prolonged bleeding from small wounds and prolonged bleeding after tooth extraction, tonsillectomy, and operations. Carriers of hemophilia bleed more than other women, especially after medical interventions. Our findings suggest that not only clotting factor levels at the extreme of the distribution, resembling mild hemophilia, but also mildly reduced clotting factor levels between 0.41 and 0.60 IU/mL are associated with bleeding.</p>

","<p>Teflon is a polymer of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related compounds.  PFOA is thought to be a carcinogen.  </p>

"How much does donating blood affect the amount of oxygen in your blood stream at high altitude?","3747","","<p>I am a regular blood donor and I am also a skydiver.  We normally go to around 13,000 feet AGL (above ground level).  Depending on how high above sea level the ground is, altitudes could be as high as 15,000 MSL (mean sea level) before a jumper is required to use supplemental oxygen.  </p>

<p>At those altitudes hemoglobin is less effective at carrying oxygen, which is why hypoxia is a risk.</p>

<p>The following chart taken from <a href=""http://www.avweb.com/news/aeromed/181893-1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> about aviation and the body shows how oxygen levels decrease as altitude increases:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oP67i.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>What I would like to know is if there is any research into the effect blood donation has on the blood stream's oxygen capacity?  Is it possible to say that x days after a donation, due to reduced hemoglobin levels, operating at 15,000 MSL would be equivalent to operating at 15,000 + x MSL without donation?</p>
","<p>The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>amount of haemoglobin * % saturation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The average blood donation is approximately 10% of total blood volume. . Since the donation will have no effect on the % saturation, the oxygen-carrying capacity at each altitude will go down by 10%.</p>

<p>By inspection of the graph in the question, the % saturation goes down by 10% at 10,000 feet. So I conclude that donating 10% of blood volume is equivalent to ascending to 10,000 feet in terms of the effect upon the blood's oxygen-carring capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Response to OP comments:</strong></p>

<p>1) Anyone living at 5,000 feet will have adapted to that altitude in two ways. First of all the erythrocyte levels of 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate will be elevated to maintain unloading of oxygen from haemoglobin in the tissues. Secondly, the number of red cells per mL of blood will have increased, to restore oxygen delivery. Incidentally this increases blood viscosity which is deleterious in the long term. Tibetans living in the Himalaya have adapted genetically to prevent this effect on their blood viscosity.</p>

<p>2) The effect of air pressure is already included in the graph, since it shows the actual degree of saturation of the blood. </p>

"Long term storage of agarose-ethidium bromide gels that have already been cast","3740","","<p>I have come up with what I thought was a clever idea: Store the agarose gels I pour, and only cut as many lanes as I need to run later, minimizing wasted agarose (and wasted effort/time) when I need to make many electrophereses using a small number of lanes.</p>

<p>I realized that over time, the EtBr would diffuse out of my gel into the buffer that the gels are kept in. Since I add 2 µl of EtBr to 50 ml gel, and the gels were kept in 400 ml TAE buffer, I added 16 µl EtBr to the buffer, reasoning that now concentrations are equal and no net diffusion will take place.</p>

<p>However, after several weeks, I noticed that the EtBr signal from the gel is severely weakened. What can I do to fix this? I can see the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use higher concentration of EtBr in the buffer (how much?)</li>
<li>Change buffer weekly, adding fresh EtBr every time</li>
<li>Cover the transparent container with aluminum foil to prevent hypothetical photobleaching</li>
</ul>

<p>Which one is most likely to solve my problem? Should I just give up, and throw away gels that are older than a day or two (I want to avoid this option, because of the record keeping needed to track when the gel was last made)?</p>
","<p>To increase storage life: after gel solidifies, dampen it with running buffer. Wrap the gel in polyvinyl chloride. Place in plastic container with a lid. Store in fridge in dark. It will last for a year as long as you re-dampen it with buffer each time you access it. <strong>Don't keep it submerged in buffer as the etbr will diffuse out.</strong> this is probably the cause of your problem. Notice when you order precast gels (either agarose or acrylamide) they are sealed and only a small vol of buffer is added to keep it hydrated. Additionally, the etbr and EDTA in the buffer helps prevent most mold growth although I have seen black mold grow a few times at around a year.</p>

<p>You can always spike the buffer with etbr adding it directly to the electrophoresis chamber before you run the gel (etbr doesn't even need to even be in the gel for it to work) although I find you get a little more sensitivity with the etbr in the gel. If you spike it be sure to mix and let it sit for about 20 min for the etbr to diffuse.</p>

<p>If you are trying to cut down on cost you are probably using a higher grade agarose than you really need for the application your doing so I would take a look at that</p>

<p>If you end up needing to store gels for rna work, add plain old Clorox bleach to a final concentration of 1% to your TAE gel just after microwaving. It sounds crazy but it works extremely well. You will completely inhibit RNAse and your rna bands will look nice!!!. The bleach also helps  with storage of the gel.</p>

"How does HIV mutate into other strains while keeping their virulent phenotype?","3730","","<p>How does a virus like HIV mutate into so many strains, and yet all of them are  harmful to our immune system? What gives this virus the ability to mutate so efficiently?</p>
","<p>Others have already touched the important points. Consider this as a summary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What gives HIV the ability to mutate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All organisms mutate by two mechanisms:</p>

<ol>
<li>Replication errors</li>
<li>Mutagenesis by physical/chemical agents that cause a chemical change
(lesion) on DNA</li>
</ol>

<p>The main enzyme responsible for HIV replication is <strong>reverse transcriptase</strong> which makes a DNA copy of its RNA genome. All RNA and DNA polymerases make some amount of error but the error rate of reverse transcriptase is much higher than usual DNA-dependent DNA polymerases because it does not have a proofreading mechanism. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does a virus like HIV mutate into so many strains, and yet all of
  them are harmful to our immune system?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As indicated in previous answers, the mutations will produce a virions with a spectrum of infectivity/pathogenicity (some can even be non-infective).
However, the immune system acts as a selective barrier which selects only those mutants that can survive (similar to what happens in evolutionary process of natural selection). The selected strains expand their population and that is how these strains get established.</p>

Would that mean that the extract from these plants would contain all these toxic elements.  </p>
","<p>Not ""all of them"". But yes, plants suck up water from the soil, with everything dissolved in this water - nutrients, heavy metals, poisons. And also they breathe air, and absorb stuff via this route. </p>

<p>There probably are some toxins which will not enter the plant, because their molecules are too large and/or fragile. For example, should a plant root come in contact with snake venom, I cannot imagine that any venom will end up stored in the plant leaves.</p>

<p>Plants also have their own metabolism, so they will change/deactivate some toxins. I've seen claims that some plants ""purify"" formaldehyde, although I don't trust the sources enough to be sure of that.  </p>

<p>But the smaller the poison molecule, and the less similar to stuff which is usually digested in nature, the more likely that it will enter the plant and stick around instead of being broken down. The heavy metals you mentioned are prime candidates. If they are present in the groundwater - or also lead from air pollution, before we banned leaded gasoline - they end up in plants, including food plants. And mushrooms are even more at risk. </p>

So I have never really quite understood this facet of human evolution, (or any other for that matter), in that, I understand the evolutionary process, but I get lost on the 'border' cases. </p>

<p>For example, we, as humans, evolved from monkeys, (to use the colloquial term, I am not a biologist by any measure). </p>

<p>My question is, doesn't this mean that at some, discrete point, there had to have been a human, whose parents were not? If that is true, how does that work, in the sense that we now have species1 giving birth to species2. </p>

<p>If not, then how exactly does this border case work? The only other alternative I see, is that the borders are 'fuzzy', but then that necessarily means that the definition of a species is itself fuzzy, which I understand is not the case. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Actually, your last paragraph is more the case than not.</p>

<p><strong>There are currently three common definitions for delineating discrete species:</strong></p>

<p>1) Phenotypically different from related species (looks or acts differently).</p>

<p>2) Produces viable offspring in the wild.</p>

<p>3) Some % of genetic difference.</p>

<p><strong>There are strengths to all three:</strong></p>

<p>1) Very easy to ascertain and measure.</p>

<p>2) Most common conception of a species.</p>

<p>3) Genes control the first two, so genetic divergence gets to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p><strong>There are also weaknesses to all three:</strong></p>

<p>1) Is notorious for mis-labeling and missing species.</p>

<p>2) Some species which can mate and produce fertile offspring under enclosed conditions do not do so in the wild (Tigers and Lions, for instance).</p>

<p>3) The <em>amount</em> of divergence has, thus far, been completely arbitrary. If there is a certain % or patterns of mutation required in the genome, science hasn't yet discovered it.</p>

<p>The fuzzy definition of species, combined in the not-exactly-intuitive generational-type thinking required for understanding evolution, and the answer to your question is (at least to the best of my understanding) the following:</p>

<p>Yes, at some point one of our ancestors gave birth to the first <em>Homo sapien</em> that was somehow genetically different from its parents. However, the magnitude of the difference is probably not as great as you might think. </p>

<p>We've already observed our closest evolutionary cousins, the Bonobos, making basic tools through flint napping: <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22197-bonobo-genius-makes-stone-tools-like-early-humans-did.html"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22197-bonobo-genius-makes-stone-tools-like-early-humans-did.html</a></p>

<p>The idea that humans jumped onto the scene with unforeseen amounts of intelligence and capability probably isn't what happened. Obviously we are capable of constructing and using the most advanced tools on the planet, but this is after several thousand generations of innovation. The very first human might have been more intelligent (or at least had the capacity to be), but otherwise probably fit in pretty well with its parents and other relatives since the <em>vast majority</em> of what we learn comes from our parents and personal experience.</p>

<p>Then over time the number of individuals with the capacity for higher modes of thinking increased as a result of the genetic inheritance of whatever mutation created the first human. The first human, to put it simply, was successfully able to pass on their mutation which gave them our unique traits, and their offspring were also successful - until you have an entire population of humans living amongst each other. Eventually our innovative capacity lead, step by step, to our dominant position on the planet.</p>

<p>Even now humans are yet evolving. Lactose tolerance (the ability to consume dairy products after childhood) is a <em>very</em> new trait among humans (and unprecedented among all mammals) only a few hundred generations old (roughly 10,000 years) that evolved <strong>twice</strong> in separate populations of humans (North Africa and Northern Europe). Our jaws are getting progressively smaller (which is why some people have to remove their wisdom teeth to maintain a straight smile - and some people don't have wisdom teeth at all), some muscles are disappearing (the Palmaris Longus is one example - it's present in about 80% of humans), and other subtle changes are occurring. </p>

<p>Just don't make the mistake of equating ""evolved"" with ""superior."" Evolution is dictated by the ever-changing demands of the environments we find ourselves in, and what's beneficial today isn't guaranteed to be beneficial forever. </p>

","<p>A pre-tRNA is transcribed from tRNA genes in DNA by RNA polymerase III. Processing occurs in the nucleus, where a 5' sequence is cleaved by RNase P, the 3's CCA motif is added, and ~10% of the nucleotides are substituted. The tRNA are transported out via the pore complexes. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes attach amino acids in the cytoplasm in a 2-step reaction that requires ATP. You'll find there's a unique splicing mechanism in tRNA that additionally splices out an anticodon intron which is abesnt in mature tRNA's:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <strong>mitogen</strong> is a chemical substance that encourages a cell to commence cell division, triggering mitosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What’s the difference between them? I suppose a mitogen specifically refers to mitosis, but if something is stimulating mitosis, isn’t it stimulating growth? Are mitogens all growth factors? Are all growth factors mitogens?</p>
","<p>There is a lot of confusion and conflicting / imprecise definitions of these terms. It's biology after all :)</p>

<p>A <em>mitogen</em> is an agent that causes a cell to enter mitosis. This definition is pretty clear, and there is a good consensus about it. (Well technically, mitosis is not the same as cell division, but we will gloss over this distinction.)</p>

<p>The term <em>growth factor</em> has at least two different definitions: (1) a factor that causes growth of tissues, organs or entire individuals; or (2) a factor that causes growth of <em>cells</em> (increase in cell size). These two versions are often mixed up, and this causes no end of confusion. Let's consider them both in turn.</p>

<p>Definition (1) is more common and probably older. Since growth of whole tissues usually (but not always) implies both cell growth and division, according to this definition, a growth factor is also a mitogen. But the reverse is not true: there are cases where cells divide without growing, for example the first few cell divisions of a fertilized egg. But note that, since this definition concerns the level of tissues or individuals, it's meaning is not entirely clear in terms of cell growth and division. Muscle growth in the adult stage usually does not involve cell division, for example.</p>

<p>Definition (2) is better suited to cell biology (in my opinion), because it actually concerns cells, not tissues. This definition is more common when studying cell growth and division; see for example <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400805632"" rel=""nofollow"">this review</a>. Cell growth is a separate phenomenon from cell division: cells can grow without dividing (fat cells, muscle fibers and neuron do this, for example), or divide without growing (as mentioned above). So with this definition, growth factor and mitogen are two completely unrelated concepts. Now, it is certainly true that many proteins can act <em>both</em> as growth factors and mitogens; Matej Pribis gives some nice examples in the other answer. But that is an empirical fact, not a question of definitions.</p>

<p>If this is her conclusion about protein levels, then any correlation between protein activation and mRNA abundance seems unlikely (as a rule. Some protein levels <em>do</em> correlate with the RNA - see the paper).</p>

<p>I am still interested in any answers that give any information about specific examples of protein activation and mRNA levels - it seems highly unlikely there are no such studies, but I have been as yet unable to find any!</p>
","<p>It has been well established that mRNA abundance serves as a poor proxy for protein abundance in most cases. <a href=""http://mcb.asm.org/content/19/3/1720.short"">This paper on yeast</a> and <a href=""http://www.mcponline.org/content/1/4/304.short"">this paper on cancer</a> both establish this, although using older techniques (SAGE and microarrays, respectively), while <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2009.10.036"">this more recent review</a> discusses the topic in light of more recent technologies (e.g. RNA-seq).</p>

<p>Perhaps the difficulty with exploring the correlation between mRNA levels and levels of active, mature proteins is that we still know so little about so many proteins and and what makes them active and mature versus inactive, premature, etc. Not all proteins need post-translational modifications to be active, but some do. Currently, this is investigated on a very detailed protein-by-protein basis (as far as I know), so gathering enough data for a large-scale study could take a long time. On the other hand, there are a variety of (increasingly affordable) high-throughput methods for measuring the abundance of thousands of RNA species simultaneously. I think people are using mRNA levels to estimate expression not because it's the most biologically cogent course of action, but rather because it is much easier, more affordable, and more high-throughput (which is all the rage these days).</p>

"Can rats pass on memories of a maze to their offspring?","3662","","<p>A friend of mine told me once about a documentary movie he saw some years ago. On this movie he saw scientists talking about particular experiment. This experiment involved rats and probably electrical traps. The rat had to get to the cheese, there were traps on the shortest route to it, and obviously it got shocked few times. What is interesting is that my friend says that when they took its offspring (probably born later) they avoided those traps.</p>

<p>I'm aware that its not how ""genetic memory"" works. Its not memory of individual, but of species (so it requires evolution). This is what I'm trying to explain to him, but he says ""he knows what he saw"". </p>

<p>Anyway <strong>maybe someone</strong> here <strong>is aware of such an experiment</strong>. I believe that he is wrong about something (or conclusions drawn where changed later), so I would like to find out more about it. </p>

<p>To sum up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Its not Tryon's Rat Experiment</li>
<li>It involved: rats, traps (probably electrical), more then one path to cheese, rat's offspring and some sort of memory/learning amongst rats.</li>
</ul>
","<p>The phenomenon you're talking about was a fad in the 60's, called 'interanimal memory transfer'. It started out when <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V._McConnell"">James McConnell</a> performed a later-discredited experiment in which he found that if you chopped up flatworms which had been exposed to some stresses, and fed them to other unexposed flatworms, the unexposed worms became wary of the source of stress quicker after eating their dead companions. He jumped to the conclusion that a 'memory molecule' was being transferred, and that the cannibal worms gained the food worms' memories of the stress.</p>

<p>People then started looking to see if they could:</p>

<ol>
<li>repeat the experiments</li>
<li>find the same phenomenon in other animals</li>
</ol>

<p>In the first case, nobody could replicate the experiments in worms, but because McConnell was such a PR genius he managed to convince the public that his results were valid (see Rilling, 1996 for more on this).</p>

<p>In the second case, Frank et al. (1970) and others tried working with rats - I think this is the experiment you're talking about in the question. They found various interesting results including that if you trained rats to run through a maze by using particularly stressful negative reinforcement (like electrocution), then those rats' children would be able to learn the new maze much faster. However, Frank et al. didn't make the same mistake as McConnell - first of all they wondered if the parent rats might be leaving a scent trail. So they used duplicate mazes with the exact same design, putting the children into clean mazes. The children of adults who had already learned the maze continued to outperform the control rats - the explanation was not scent trails.</p>

<p>Next they wondered whether it might be that the second generation rats had been born with a higher wariness as a result of the stress their parents suffered; i.e. it could be a hormonal transfer from mother to child (e.g. cortisol, the stress hormone).</p>

<p>Frank et al. tested their hypothesis by torturing some rats for a while (rules about animal welfare were not strict in the 70's). They would lock some rats in a small jar and bash them about for a long time, then kill them, chop them up, and take out their livers. They fed the livers to other rats, and found that after eating the livers the other rats learned the maze much faster. They interpreted the results in what now seems a sensible light: <strong>the stressed rats were producing high concentrations of a stress-signalling molecule. When those rats either had children or were fed to other rats, they passed on high doses of the stress molecule. This raised the alterness and wariness of the receipient rats so that they were much quicker to learn which parts of the maze were dangerous.</strong></p>

<p>There is no evidence that the child rats actually 'remembered' the maze - they still had to find their way around, but they were extremely wary of the electrocution plates and so avoided them, finding the safest way to the end. <strong>This is not a case of genetic memory</strong>.</p>

"Do insects' muscles become stronger with exercise?","3660","","<p>I am curious to know if insect muscles become stronger with exercise, because I have seen many insects get tired out, but I have never seen one get stronger. They always seem to become permanently weakened from excessive exercise. Do they get stronger like people do?</p>
","<p>There are instances of insect muscle growth in response to increased use. The flight muscles of the tsetse fly (<em>Glossina morsitans</em>) have been observed to grow at a faster rate when subjected to enforced exercise <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.1051500205/abstract"">(Anderson and Finlayson, 1976)</a>. Also larger mandibular adductor muscles (which power the feeding apparatus), and associated head capsule have been noted for caterpillars and grasshoppers feeding on particularly hard grasses <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/1696716"">(Bernays, 1986)</a>. However these examples occur immediately post-eclosion (i.e. after emergence as adults), and during immature stages respectively. Insect muscle typically grows during larval/nymphal (immature) stages, and often for a brief period at the start of adulthood - known as the teneral period. During immature stages, insects typically have a flexible membrane to allow for tissue growth and expansion, this can also be the case during the teneral period, before the inflexible exoskeleton has fully hardened. However at full maturity, insect growth is limited by the rigidity of their exoskeleton.</p>

<p>As far as excessive exercise is concerned, that some insects may be weakened permanently may be more to do with the fact that their life strategy is different to ours. Due to the vast number of offspring per adult, and subsequent low survival chance of any given individual, there could be an evolutionary advantage for individuals pushing themselves to possibly deadly extremes. This could lead to many deaths, whilst retaining a viable population and thus accelerate the emergence of a population of fitter individuals.</p>

"Why are plants classified in living things?","3655","","<p>@Volunteers Beware that I am none of the biological magnates. Nor a philosopher. This is just a sign of curiosity. And, I want only an intuition that enables me to see the difference.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the growth of the plants and their metabolism is induced by Chemical laws and physical laws (govern matter and energy). Whatever, absorbing sunlight, photosynthesis, pollination etc are persuaded by physical and chemical laws. And, it is not surprising because all matters experience Physical and Chemical laws. The Food going upward in a plant is illustrated by Capillary Action. Pollination is influenced by wind and like that.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the chief thing which differs us from non-living things is the existence of 6 senses. At least, (various) animals have some of these. But as far as I know, plants possess none of that. So, after all, why are they classified in group of Living things? (Or, why plants' behaviour is not classified in Physics and Chemistry in stead of Physiology?) </p>
","<p><strong>Short Answer</strong></p>

<p>Yes, plants are alive!</p>

<p><strong>How to define life?</strong></p>

<p>It is up to anyone to define what is living and what is not. In other words, the definition of what is living is arbitrary. Viruses are a common limit case (see the post <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9438/why-isnt-a-virus-alive"">why-isnt-a-virus-alive?</a>).</p>

<p><strong>What are plants able to do?</strong></p>

<p>Now coming to plants, everyone seem to agree quite well on whether plants are alive or not. I think that you misunderstand what plants really are and that  brought you to eventually consider them as non-living. Here is a short list of things you might want to consider about plants.</p>

<ul>
<li>Plants have DNA (plants often have very large genomes compared to animals).</li>
<li>Plants reproduce</li>
<li>Plants evolve (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_history_of_plants"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki > Evolutionary_history_of_plants</a>)</li>
<li>Plants grow</li>
<li>Plants have a rich and complicated physiology and metabolism (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_physiology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki > plants_physiology</a>)</li>
<li>Plants interact with other species of the same species and different species.</li>
<li>Plants can communicate (chemical cues) with other plants.</li>
<li>Plants are made of cells. Their cells contain a nucleus and a mitochondrion (just like animals). They also have other double-membrane organelles than mitochondria.</li>
<li>Plants are more closely related to animals than they are to bacteria. Animals are more related to fungi than they are to plants. (<a href=""http://tolweb.org/Eukaryotes/3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Explore the tree of life by yourself on tolweb.org</a>)</li>
<li>Some plants also consume organic material (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous_plant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki > carnivorous plants</a>)</li>
<li>Plants get disease such as all kind of infection and cancer (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_plant_diseases"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki > Lists_of_plant_diseases</a>)</li>
<li>Plants can be parasitic.</li>
<li>Some plants are motile (SE post > <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1008/are-there-any-motile-plants"">are-there-any-motile-plants</a>)</li>
<li>Some plants are symbiontic (including endosymbiontic) and some are parasiti</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sensing</strong></p>

<p>You seem to consider senses as an important distinction between living and non-living things. Note that the 6th sense that we attribute to humans have a pretty bad semantics and one could count more or fewer senses. Anyway, plants have tons of sense. They are able to sense:</p>

<ul>
<li>chemicals</li>
<li>gravity</li>
<li>light</li>
<li>moisture</li>
<li>infections</li>
<li>temperature</li>
<li>oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations</li>
<li>parasite infestation</li>
<li>disease</li>
<li>physical disruption</li>
<li>sound</li>
<li>touch</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>It would actually be quite complicate to find a definition that is not based on phylogeny or structural differences that would allow you to exclude plants but nothing else from the realm of what is considered alive. So, Yes <strong>plants are alive!</strong></p>

"How are Maggots Sterilized (Disinfected)?","3653","","<p>For maggot therapy, how are maggots disinfected? I'd imagine there's a limited scope of measurements that can be taken to sterilize the maggots - i.e. we don't want to sterilize them and kill them too. </p>
","<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambroise_Par%C3%A9"" rel=""nofollow"">Ambroise Paré</a> is credited with being the first to note his observations on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggot_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">Maggot Debridement Therapy</a> (MDT) in the 1500 though it is a technology that has been used for centuries (<a href=""http://medent.usyd.edu.au/projects/maggott.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>). It wasn't until the 1920's that therapeutic experimentation with maggots was instigated by William Baer, a clinical professor in orthopaedic surgery at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, whose unorthodox methods were successful in the treatment of osteomyelitis and pyogenic wounds. He is also considered the father of modern MDT since he was the first to devise a way to sterilize maggots (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048269/"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>). </p>

<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>

<p>In addition to removing necrotic tissue from the wound (a procedure known as debridement) maggots have also been proven to disinfect wounds, promote healing, and inhibit a pesky substance known as biofilm from forming on the wound bed. Maggots are nature’s cleansers, showing up to remove dead tissue and promote healing (<a href=""http://www.thewca.com/blog/201401/%E2%80%9Coh-maggot-where-art-thou%E2%80%9D-quick-history-and-update-maggot-therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>).</p>

<p>Currently <em>Lucilia sericata</em>, or the greenbottle blowfly larvae is preferred for MDT because</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Firstly, larvae have been shown to debride wounds with extremely low
  probability of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myiasis"" rel=""nofollow"">myiasis</a> upon clinical application. Larval secretions
  have been shown to help in tissue regeneration. <em>L. sericata</em> have also
  been shown to lower bacteremia levels in patients infected with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"" rel=""nofollow"">MRSA</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_green_bottle_fly#Medical_importance"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Sterilizing maggots</strong></p>

<p>In early applications, sterilizing the larvae was a major problem. Doctors had to first bathe the eggs in bleach and then soak them in mercuric chloride or formaldehyde. The bandages, gaudy and cumbersome for the patients, were held in place with either surgical tape or Unna’s paste—made of zinc oxide, gelatin, glycerine, and water. Other problems that doctors faced included the maggots escaping during the application process and the leakage of toxic waste secreted by the maggots into the wound, which led to infections such as tetanus. Today, commercial and research laboratories produce sterile larvae. And instead of the bulky gauze bandage, a form-fitting cast with a nylon net to corral the larvae is placed over the wound. An absorbent pad put on top of the netting soaks up the larvae’s toxic waste products. The number of larvae used has also changed. Early prescriptions ranged from 5–6 maggots for a fingertip injury to 500–600 for a more serious wound. Today, the scientific standard of 10 larvae/cm<sup>2</sup> is used (<a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/mdd/v04/i10/html/10health.html"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>).</p>

<p>William Baer proposed a method to produce sterilized maggots and it is understood that sterilization has to start from the egg stage in itself (<a href=""http://jbjs.org/content/16/3/572"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>). The sterilization solution that he proposed was.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stock Solution of bichloride of mercury, strength one in 1,000 parts.
  Stock Solution of fifty per cent. ethyl alcohol. Take equal volume of
  each Solution, mix, and add one-half of one per cent. chemically pure
  hydrochloric acid. The final Solution will contain bichloride of
  mercury, strength one in 2,000 parts, twenty-five per cent. alcohol,
  and one-half of one per cent. hydrochloric acid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He did not sterilize the maggots as such but took care to feed it sterile food. His work can be read <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048276/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Another solution used for sterilization was  5 per cent solution of formalin plus 1 per cent sodium hydroxide (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002961034901471"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>).  Sterilization of maggot larvae in itself was found to be hard with some success being reported (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002961033904614"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>). Current maggot sterilization techniques include.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is no first generation that has been detailed as such. Mostly sterilization starts from the egg stage. As far as bacteria in the gut is concerned, if sterilization is carried out well, it has been found that there is a significant decrease in any harmful bacteria present (<a href=""http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1603/0022-2585-38.2.161"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a>).

"Is urine dirty as soon as it leaves the human body?","3632","","<p>Human urine is sterile as long as it is in the human body. But is it dirty after leaving the human body? Could you get sick from it, if you drink it or don't wash your hands, for example?</p>
","<p>It was believed for a long time that urine stored in the urinary bladder is sterile. However, Wolfe et al(<a href=""http://jcm.asm.org/content/50/4/1376.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>). recently found evidence of bacterial presence in the urine extracted from bladders of healthy women. In an article just published, Hilt et al. found that at least some bacteria found in the bladder of healthy women are viable and can be grown in a laboratory after extraction from the bladder).<a href=""http://jcm.asm.org/content/52/3/871.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a> (Paywall). They expect that the same is the case for men.</p>

<p>From the Hilt et al. paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thirty-five different genera and 85 different species were identified
  by EQUC. The most prevalent genera isolated were Lactobacillus (15%),
  followed by Corynebacterium (14.2%), Streptococcus (11.9%),
  Actinomyces (6.9%), and Staphylococcus (6.9%). Other genera commonly
  isolated include Aerococcus, Gardnerella, Bifidobacterium, and
  Actinobaculum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that these species for the most part (Actinobaculum being one exception, as a possible uropathogen) appear to be part of the normal microbiome (collection of microorganisms) in healthy people in the same way as bacteria inhabit other parts of healthy persons. Additionally, the recovered organisms required special care to achieve growth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the bacteria isolated required either increased CO2 or
  anaerobic conditions for growth, along with prolonged incubation, and
  they often were present in numbers below the threshold of detection
  used in routine diagnostic urine culture protocols.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, fresh urine is non-sterile but probably unlikely to cause infection in healthy persons.</p>

<p>In the process of leaving the body, there is a chance of contamination from organisms living in the urinary tract or on the surface of the body. However, if organisms picked up from the urinary tract made you sick, I except that you would already be having symptoms of an urinary tract infection, as the stomach is hardly a more forgiving environment. The risk of contamination from the surface of the body would depend on personal hygiene.</p>

"What's the difference between male and female?","3621","","<p>As long as we only look at humans the differences are clear: males have chromosomes XY, produce sperm and don't get pregnant. Females have chromosomes XX, produce egg cells and bear babies. But when you consider other species, things are more complicated: in birds, it's females who carry the Y chromosomes. In pipefish and sea horses, it's the males who get pregnant. So maybe the only reliable criterion to tell if an animal is a male or a female is looking at its reproductive cells, and decide if they look like spermatozoa or egg cells. But then there are male and female plants, where none of the methods above applies.</p>

<p>So how do you tell, in general, who's male and who's female in a species? Or is the distinction arbitrary?</p>
","<p>Sexes (male and female) are generally defined in terms of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisogamy""><strong><em>Anisogamy</em></strong></a>, which means that there are size differences between the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete"">gametes</a> (i.e. the reproductive cells that fuse at fertilization). The sex with smaller gametes is defined as male and the sex with larger gametes is defined as female (individuals that can produce both types of gametes are called hermaphrodites). This is the case in both animals and plants (plants have pollen vs. ovules and microsporangia vs. megasporangia), and the definition of sexes is therefore not dependent on chromosomal makeup as such or which sex that carries the young. Actual sex determiniation in a particular species is often based on chromosomal inheritance though, but other systems also exists (e.g. environmental cues or sequential hermaphroditism). <em>Anisogamy</em> also comes in several different types, where animals generally have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oogamy"">Oogamy</a>, where males have small mobile spermatozoa and females large stationary egg cells.</p>

<p>More generally, <em>Anisogamy</em> is a special case of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating_type""><strong><em>mating types</em></strong></a> in sexually reproducing organisms. In for instance fungi, gametes of different mating types are of the same size (<em>isogamous</em>) and they are therefore only labelled as mating types (e.g +/-) and not different sexes. Functionally, if we are simplifying the issue, male gametes can be viewed only as carriers of genetic information, while female gametes also contain the nutrients necessary for the early development of a newly formed embryo.</p>

"What are the major causes of mutations in DNA?","3609","","<p>I know that point mutations can change the base sequence of a gene by altering a specific codon that codes for a particular amino acid. Are these mutations purely random events that occur when DNA is being copied into a cell? Furthermore, can environmental factors play a role in the amount of mutations that occur?</p>
","<p>Welcome to Biology.SE!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>can environmental factors play a role in the amount of mutations that occur?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! The environmental factors that increase the mutation rate are called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mutagens</a>. You will definitely want to have a look in the wikipedia article. You may also want to read the wikipedia page on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagenesis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mutagenesis</a></p>

<p>Some chemicals increase the mutation rate, physical agents such as radiation also increase the mutation rate. There are viruses that are mutagens as well. Also, the number of mutations that an organism produce can also be phenotypically plastic. For example, plants have been shown to increase thee number of mutations they produced in response to stressing environment. The reason (or at least the commonly stated reason) is that they produce many mutations, ""hoping"" that at least one of the offsprings will carry a beneficial mutation and will be very fit even in this environment that is stressing for the parents. Many viruses and some bacteria also act as mutagens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are these mutations purely random events that occur when DNA is being copied into a cell?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mutations are random in the sense that it is impossible to predict with certitude that a given mutation will occur at a given locus (locus=position in the genome). As a consequence, it is also true that mutations are random in the sense that it is impossible to predict the effect on the phenotype (and on the fitness) of a future mutation. Mutation rate varies throughout the genome. Typically, repeated DNA sequence tend to have higher mutation rate. Also, transposons causes many mutations and regions in the vicinity of transposons have higher mutation rate. But again, you should have a close look to the wikipedia pages I linked above.</p>

<p>Note that a full answer would require going into the terminology of the term ""random"" which itself is a question of philosophy. When using the term random, it is always important to specify what is meant exactly (which is not done in the question) as one may argue that since the Big Bang happened everything has been deterministic.</p>

<p>The nutrients that contain are far better than average meal a person eats the majority of times, al least me. However, since is not solid food, do our digestive system need to work harder?</p>

<p>Scientific reports would be appreciated, comparing these two modes of feeding.</p>
","<p>Yes you could live off a protein shake type supplement if it had the vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, and fats you would need. Would you want to? Probably not. </p>

<p>First thing we must determine is the protein whey or soy? If a male is consuming this meal replacement and the only protein is from soy, their estrogen levels will be elevated. In <em>Soy Protein Isolate Increases Urinary Estrogens and the Ratio of 2:16α-Hydroxyestrone in Men at High Risk of Prostate Cancer</em>, Dr.s Jill M. Hamilton-Reeves, Salome A. Rebello, William Thomas, Joel W. Slaton, and Mindy S. Kurzer concluded that soy does elevated estrogen in men which helped with the reduction of prostate cancer [<a href=""http://jn.nutrition.org/content/137/10/2258.long"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>], but as a male, you wouldn't want to have a lifetime of increased estrogen [<a href=""http://www.healthline.com/health/high-estrogen"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>].</p>

<ul>
<li>Infertility. Estrogen is partly responsible for creating healthy
sperm. When estrogen levels are high, sperm levels in semen may fall.
This can lead to fertility issues.</li>
<li>Gynecomastia. Estrogen may stimulate breast tissue growth. Men with
too much estrogen may start developing larger breasts.</li>
<li>Erectile dysfunction. A balance of both testosterone and estrogen is
important for healthy sexual growth and development. Sexual function
may be impacted when these hormones become imbalanced. Men with high
levels of estrogen may have difficulty getting or maintaining an
erection.</li>
</ul>

<p>So to be on the safe side, let's assume that the protein is from whey and we have one less thing to worry about. Now as for the vitamins and minerals, the Mayo Clinic states that [<a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/supplements/art-20044894"" rel=""nofollow"">3</a>]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Supplements aren't intended to be a food substitute because they can't replicate all of the nutrients and benefits of whole foods, such as fruits and vegetables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and there are three main differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Greater nutrition. Whole foods are complex, containing a variety of
the micronutrients your body needs — not just one. An orange, for
example, provides vitamin C plus some beta carotene, calcium and
other nutrients. It's likely these compounds work together to produce
their beneficial effect.</li>
<li>Essential fiber. Whole foods, such as whole grains, fruits,
vegetables and legumes, provide dietary fiber. Most high-fiber foods
are also packed with other essential nutrients. Fiber, as part of a
healthy diet, can help prevent certain diseases, such as type 2
diabetes and heart disease, and it can also help manage constipation.</li>
<li>Protective substances. Whole foods contain other substances important
for good health. Fruits and vegetables, for example, contain
naturally occurring substances called phytochemicals, which may help
protect you against cancer, heart disease, diabetes and high blood
pressure. Many are also good sources of antioxidants — substances
that slow down oxidation, a natural process that leads to cell and
tissue damage.</li>

"Pipetting damage to cells","3590","","<p>I'm curious how much damage is potentially inflicted by shear stress by pipetting. I know that syringes used for stem cell injection can cause a lot of damage. However, to what extent does this happen with P20 and P200 pipette tips? Understandably the shear modulus of bacterial cells is significantly different from that of cancer cells, which will be different from that of stem cells.</p>
","<p>This is an excellent question, I have been training people to culture cells for about 12 years and students have a hard time grasping this and appreciating the importance etc.</p>

<p>What cells are usually experiencing during pipetting is analogous to a crowd of people trying to fit through the doorway of a building. Shearing during pipetting  is certainly a legitimate concern in cell culture. You will notice its negative effect on viability most explicitly when pipetting cells in freezing
 medium (containing DMSO) following a thaw. Until their DMSO concentration drops their membranes are weaker &amp; more fluid. That's why you pipette the frozen cells drop-wise to the fresh medium, to be especially gentle at this point.</p>

<p>Prokaryotic cells such as the above mentioned TOP10 cells are treated with Calcium chloride and glycerol which has essentially the same effect on their walls and membranes. Hence pipetting should be delicately performed after thawing these cells as well. </p>

<p>With that being said, if you compare the sensitivity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to shearing, eukaryotic cells are profoundly more sensitive.</p>

<p>For individuals using competent bacteria for sub-cloning and other routine uses, killing a small percentage of of your cells is not that important. However if you are using the transformation to generate cDNA libraries it's very important that you have a titer sufficiently representing the transcriptome the library is composed of. </p>

<p>In these instances using a more premium competent cell, adhering to correct temperatures and minimizing pipetting is essential. This is why many are taught to swirl the DNA the with the competent cells, rather than the harsher alternative: pipetting up-and-down.</p>

<p>The four most important factors that contribute to cellular shearing are, and in order form most to least contributory:</p>

<ol>
<li>Diameter of the bore in the pipette tip, the smaller the more shearing. </li>
<li>Speed at which the suspension is passing through the opening of the tip. The faster the more damaging.  </li>
<li>Size and rigidity of the cell. Larger cells are more prone to damage.  Cells with a murein wall are less prone to damage.  </li>
<li>Concentration of cells. Cultures that are more concentrated are more prone to damage.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because the make up if the cell itself is so influential on the amount of damage, and because of the enormous variety of cells; designing a representative experiment to assess damage would be very difficult and  laborious.</p>

<p>Finally,  the variety of tips and seriologicals is also enormous. However if one were to attempt to assess this it could be done:</p>

<p>Choose a representative variety of cell lines, choose a representative variety of pipettes. One would probably want to use a robotic pipette to be able to  evaluate incrementally assigned speeds and pressures. Look at different culture concentrations,  phases of the growth curve, time between pipetting and analysis, distance between the exiting fluid and the culture etc, etc.</p>

<p>I think a very successful analysis method would be using propidium iodide and FACS.</p>

<p>After your experiment which will cost a lot of time and $, I think you will find common sense rules: keep pipetting to a minimum and use wider tips whenever possible.</p>

"Is humans' height ideal?","3590","","<p>More or less we humans are around 1.70 meters tall. </p>

<p>My question is, would it be possible to scale us? that is, is it in principle possible having humans 1 cm tall, or 10 meters tall or is there some reason that makes our height somehow ideal?</p>
","<p>Humans can, to some extent, be scaled: While most humans are two meters tall; the human body essentially works throughout the entire range from around a meter to around two and a half meters, although you tend to run into problems at the extremes.</p>

<p>However, outside of that range you run into the tyranny of the square-cube law:</p>

<p>As you scale a creature (or, in fact, anything), it's mass increases proportionally to the cube of the scale, while its surface area increases proportionally to the square of the scale.</p>

<p>This means that as you scale humans down, their mass, and hence their ability to <em>generate</em> heat would drop faster than their skin area, and hence their ability to <em>dissipate</em> heat; meaning that if unaltered, smaller humans would rapidly run into problems of freezing to death.</p>

<p>(Small animals typically solve this through a number of methods: Higher metabolic rates, rounder bodies, and more fur. Small humans, i.e. babies also suffer under this, and solve it by having what is typically referred to as ""baby fat"", a blubber that, among other things, aids thermoregulation.)</p>

<p>Similarly, as the human body is scaled up, the opposite problem arises: The body becomes unable to dissipate heat quickly enough. Larger animals solve this problems with giant organs specifically suited to radiate heat, such as elephant ears; or through submersion in water, as seen is cetaceans and hippopotamuses; or simply through living in cold climates, such as the polar bear. (All of this is typically augmented by lower metabolic rates.)</p>

<p>Heat economy isn't the only problem with size, however:</p>

<p>Especially when scaling up, the strength of various structures in the body become problematic. Unusually (yet not even freakishly) tall humans generally have some manner of bone problems, and also often have problems with too small hearts, leading to low blood pressure, or too big ones, leading to heart failure.</p>

<p>If the change was gradual enough, with sufficient adaptation, this wouldn't <em>necessarily</em> be a problem. After all, giraffes and elephants get on perfectly well; but a pump-valve heart such as we have cannot be scaled up indefinitely.</p>

<p>With a continuous-flow heart, this limit could probably be stretched, but how that would even begin to work biologically I have no idea.</p>

<p>Further problems with very large humans include getting enough air flow through the lungs, the enormous chore it would be to stand up or sit down, and of course, just getting enough food to drive the enormous body.</p>

<p>The long and short of it is: Anything less than about half a meter would probably leave us freezing to death; and anything more than two and a half meters is quite frankly a stretch (if you'll pardon the pun).</p>

<p>(There are people alive now that are more than two and a half meters tall, but they are not generally speaking in good health, although some do get on.)</p>

<p>Of course, all of this is predicated on the specific gravitational and atmospheric conditions on Earth.</p>

<p>On another planet with a greater or lesser gravity, a different proportion of oxygen in the air, or just a denser atmosphere; many of these limits and limitations would be quite different indeed. (Which is why whales, living in such an alien world as the sea, can be an order of magnitude bigger than any animal that lives on land.)</p>

I have no trouble whatsoever seeing ladders and DNA samples of down to 100 ug in wells not much bigger than about 4 mm.</p>

<p>Here are the factors that you can manipulate to alter the brightness:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amount of EtBr. More is brighter. (However, you already use a lot - using less may even be better because it would reduce background while still saturating the DNA with EtBr)</li>
<li>Amount of DNA. More is brighter. To avoid guesswork, use a ladder and consult the instructions in its manual or spec sheet. They usually have an example picture of a gel, and say exactly how they obtained it.</li>
<li>You messed up. Do other people in the lab get good gels? Ask them to do the protocol with you.</li>
<li>Sample preparation. Are you using a loading dye in the correct amount? Is the DNA diffusing out of the wells? Are you spilling a lot of it when you load?</li>
<li>Band width. Obviously if you load the same amount of DNA in a well 4 times as wide, it will be 4 times fainter.</li>
<li>Strength of UV light. Many illuminators have a knob to adjust the intensity, people turn it down to avoid damaging DNA when gel-purifying restriction fragments. You can also play with intensity, gamma and exposure in a geldoc machine.</li>
<li>Quality of EtBr. I've never actually had this happen, but your stock may be bad for some reason. Ask another lab for a ul or two to easily control for this.</li>
<li>Quality of DNA. Obviously, your sample must actually have DNA in it, and not be degraded. You can check amount and purity easily with a spectrophotometer, but it will not tell you if the DNA has been digested into its component nucleotides (that is usually checked with a gel).</li>
<li>Amount of gel. The crucial variable is obviously not total amount of EtBr, but concentration. Less gel, brighter bands - but you seem to be using a standard gel amount.</li>
<li>Quality of gel. Again, never had this happen, but try making the gel with someone else's reagents.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can see that you have a ladder in the middle, so at least some DNA is definitely there.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that off-the-shelf cameras are not good at imaging the EtBr fluorescence, because the wavelength is a bit unusual. The nice pictures you see in papers are taken with a specialized geldoc machine or a camera with an appropriate filter.</p>

Birds on the other hand seem to point their head in one direction for a while, then abruptly point their head in another direction and stay in the new position for a while. Then they continue with the abrupt movement. Why is that?</p>
","<p>Most species of birds have 2 foveas, the <strong>temporal fovea</strong> and the <strong>central fovea</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>temporal fovea, which is like ours in the sense that it looks straight
  ahead and offers binocular vision (i.e. the temporal foveas of both
  eyes point in the same direction). But birds also have a central
  fovea, which points sideways and is, obviously, monocular (i.e., the
  central foveas of both eyes look in opposite directions).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the bird has a choice of which fovea it wants to look through. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can look straight ahead with its temporal foveas, to the left with
  the central fovea of its left eye, or to the right with the central
  fovea of its right eye. And this is not a hypothetical possibility:
  Birds actually do switch between foveas all the time! This is why they

"Magnetic-activated cell sorting vs. FACS","3543","","<p>When sorting cell populations it is possible to use either magnetic-activated cell sorting or fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS). I am wondering when you would choose either technique and what the pro's and con's of each technique are.</p>

<p>As FACS sorts cells one by one, I can imagine magnetic-activated cell sorting is a faster process. So I guess if time is an important factor this could be used to base your decision on. Also by sorting cells one at a time I assume FACS is a lot more precise, and will lead to less 'contamination'.</p>

<p>So, are there <strong>other factors</strong> at play here that can influence the choice of magnetic-activated cell sorting over FACS, and what are the <strong>pro's and con's</strong> of these techniques respectively?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.miltenyibiotec.com/~/media/Files/Navigation/Cell%20Separation/macs-technology-cell-isolation-brochure.ashx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Magnetic-activated cell sorting</a> (PDF download), or MACS, is a procedure developed by <a href=""http://www.miltenyibiotec.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Miltenyi Biotec</a> to separate cells from complex mixtures using antibody-coated magnetic nanoparticles. The antibodies are specific for certain cell surface markers, either expressed on your population of interest (positive selection), or expressed on undesired cell types (negative selection). After adding the antibody-coated beads to the cell mixture and incubating, the suspension is added to a special single-use separation column affixed to a magnet, to which the beads stick, while unlabeled cells flow through. If performing a negative selection, the flow-through is your population of interest and the bound beads and cells are discarded. If your cells of interest are bound to the beads (positive selection), the column is washed several times to make sure unbound or weakly-bound cells are washed through, then the column is removed from the magnet and the cell-bead complexes are eluted.</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry#Fluorescence-activated_cell_sorting_.28FACS.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fluorescence-activated cell sorting</a> or FACS, the initial complex cell mixture is first labeled with one or more cell surface marker-specific antibodies that have been conjugated to fluorescent dyes. Cells can also be analyzed that express one or more recombinant <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fluorescent proteins</a> in conjunction with a gene of interest, allowing for selection of cells without using antibodies. After incubation and wash steps, red blood cells are lysed, if analyzing whole blood. The reason for RBC lysis is shown below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WZm0j.png"" alt=""whole blood FACS""></p>

<p>Without lysis, the RBCs overwhelm the cytometer, as they make up around 95% of the cells in human whole blood. White blood cells (leukocytes), on the other hand, only make up 0.1-0.2% of cells, and lymphocytes between about 15 to 50% of leukocytes.</p>

<p>The cell mixture is then analyzed on a cell sorter such as a <a href=""http://www.bdbiosciences.com/us/instruments/research/cell-sorters/bd-facsaria-iii/m/744763"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BD FACSAria</a>. </p>

<p>The cells pass in single file past one or more laser beams, which excite the dyes and cause them to fluoresce at a certain wavelength. The user can then use gating to select the combination and intensity of colors they are interested in, and when a cell meets the criteria, it is given an electrical charge, and electro magnets direct it into a collection container.</p>

<hr>

<p>So what are the pros and cons of each technology? MACS separation generally is quicker than FACS staining, and a greater number of cells can be processed at one time (sometimes orders of magnitude more, depending on instrument and protocol). If you are, for example, looking to purify large numbers of CD4+ T cells from whole blood, MACS may be the better choice of the two (although I prefer the <a href=""http://www.stemcell.com/en/Products/Popular-Product-Lines/RosetteSep.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RosetteSep</a> system for that particular requirement). MACS doesn't require a rather expensive dedicated instrument, although automatic platforms are available if needed. On the downside, most MACS-qualified beads are mostly only available from Miltenyi, so if they do not have beads with your particular marker of interest available, you will need to do the conjugation yourself, at the expense of time and possibly precious antibody while you optimize conditions. Fluorescent-conjugated antibodies are extremely common, and available from practically innumerable companies, so unless you are working with a self-generated antibody it's much more likely that you'll be able to find one for FACS quite easily. There <em>are</em> MACS beads that contain antibodies directed at certain fluorophores, so you can use flow antibodies for MACS, although optimization is likely still necessary. Finally, MACS separation is only an option for cells that have your marker of interest expressed on the cell surface.</p>

<p>One of the major advantages of FACS is multicolor staining (depending on the instrument you're using). This makes it much more straightforward to purify potentially rare populations that are only differentiated by their combined expression of a number of surface markers, necessitating multiple gating steps. If this were to be accomplished by MACS, you would need to go through multiple rounds of purification, something that could take longer than FACS, and not necessarily be feasible, as a certain number of cells are required for each MACS run. With FACS, these rare populations (which may only be tens or hundreds of cells per million) can be collected just as easily as more common ones. Also, as mentioned above, there are more antibodies available for flow/FACS than for direct MACS. Additionally, FACS allows for sorting of cells expressing GFP and relatives, letting you collect populations based on internal markers.</p>

"Why do men have nipples?","3541","","<p>I'd be tempted to call nipples in men vestigial, but that suggests they have no modern function. They <em>do</em> have a function, of course, but only in women. So why do <em>men</em> (and all male mammals) have them? </p>
","<p>The two key concepts here are </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>sex-specific selection</strong>, and the fact that </li>
<li><strong>males and females share the majority of genes</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>1) sex-specific selection</strong></p>

<p>Obviously any population where females lacked nipples would be in trouble. Men, on the other hand, have no evolutionary need for them, but they don't <em>pay</em> much either—there is no strong selection <em>against</em> men with nipples. So at first sight, it seems that <em>nipples are positively selected in females while seem to be quite neutral in males</em>.</p>

<p><strong>2) Males and females share the majority of genes</strong></p>

<p>If you consider two separate species where the two species undergo different selection pressures, you will just see one species evolve toward one optima while the other one will independently evolve toward the other optima.</p>

<p>However, males and females are not independent entities. The vast majority of our genes can be found in one sex as well as in the other sex. In other words, <strong>male phenotypes do not evolve independently of female phenotypes</strong>. As a result of this interdependence, you can end up with the trait that is selected in one sex present in the other sex.</p>

<p><strong>Evolutionary equilibrium</strong></p>

<p>This is all much more rigorously defined in terms of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_coefficient"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">selection coefficients</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_pressure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">evolutionary pressure</a>. Without going into the math, the questions of <em>who has the highest selection coefficient</em> and <em>How differential is gene expression for this trait</em> are important questions to predict the equilibrium trait value in both sexes.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of a strong selection pressure</strong></p>

<p>Finally, any trait that is seemingly not-useful has to have a significant disadvantage on the fitness of the organism to be selected out (<a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/35532/3340"">Why do some bad traits evolve, and good ones don&#39;t?</a>). Even if a trait is useless for both males and females it may persist. The case of females needing the trait just makes its elimination in males even more difficult, as explained above. However, in some mammalian species the males do lack the nipples (<a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/34150/3340"">Evolutionarily, why do male rats and horses lack nipples?</a>).</p>

"Why does a light object appear lighter in your peripheral vision when it's dark?","3540","","<p>So, I am not sure I can reproduce it via images, but the steps are:</p>

<p>1) At night, open a window and have a look at the surface of the earth</p>

<p>2) Suppose there's an object that reflects a tiny amount of light</p>

<p>3) When you actually try to focus your eyes at this object, you either don't see anything (depends on the amount of light it reflects) or you can hardly see it</p>

<p>4) When you focus your eyes on something that is 3-10 metres away, you can easily see this object with your ambient vision. Not the details, but it seems that it reflects more light. </p>

<p>Why does it happen?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
Peripheral vision is more light-sensitive than central vision.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
When you look directly at an object the image is projected onto the <em>fovea</em>. The fovea has maximal visual acuity (high resolution) and a high density of cones, which are specialized photoreceptors to sense colors. However, cones are not very sensitive to light.</p>

<p>Here is a picture showing the foveal field of view:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xcRLD.jpg"" alt=""foveal view""><br>
<sup><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=""http://cleareyesight-batesmethod.info/id114.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pinhole Eyeglasses</a></sup></p>

<p>If you look at the same object using peripheral vision, the image is formed more eccentrically on the retina. Here, cones are sparse, but high densities of rods are present. Rods do not detect color, but are much more sensitive to light than cones. In fact, they can faithfully detect a single photon! (<a href=""http://webvision.umh.es/webvision/Evolution.%20PART%20III.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Webvision</a>) Moreover, many rods converge onto a single ganglion cell, and rod responses are therefore summated. This spatial  summation further increases light sensitivity in the periphery, but degrades spatial resolution.</p>

<p>Here is an image on rod and cone distributions on the retina, showing a high cone-density in the fovea and a high rod density more eccentrically:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E04Ue.gif"" alt=""rods cones""><br>
<sup><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=""http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-iii-retinal-circuits/circuitry-for-rod-cells-through-the-retina/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Webvision</a></sup></p>

<p>And here is an image showing the higher light sensitivity of rods over cones:</p>

<sup><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=""http://webvision.umh.es/webvision/Evolution.%20PART%20III.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Webvision</a></sup></p>

<p>Hence, <strong>peripheral vision is more light sensitive</strong> because: (1) there are more rods in the peripheral retina; (2) rods are more light sensitive; and (3) eccentric retinal rod circuitry further amplifies the rod responses. However, color perception and spatial resolution are better developed in the central field of view.

"What is the difference between eugenics and evolution by natural selection?","3540","","<p>So with the working definition of Eugenics: ""the aim to improve the human gene pool"". What are key features that distinguish Eugenics from evolution by natural selection?  I mean, besides that natural selection occurs naturally.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection"" rel=""nofollow"">Selection</a> is a mechanism of evolution which favours specific forms of traits over others, this can cause the spread of beneficial mutations through a population.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"" rel=""nofollow"">Natural selection</a> is the spread of beneficial traits/genes through populations as a result of the natural variance in their effect on reproductive output (a function of life history traits like lifespan aging and reproductive rates). A classic example is that of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches"" rel=""nofollow"">Darwin's finches</a>, where different variants of bill length and shape have evolved in populations based on what food resources (types of seed) are available to them and their ability to utilise those resources.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding"" rel=""nofollow"">Artificial selection</a> is selection imposed on a population by humans to deliberately affect specific traits. Examples of this would be milk yield in cattle (we want more efficient production and better quality milk), dog breeds (selection on a whole host of traits like colour, beardedness, height, length) and crops like wheat and barley (selected for higher efficiency and  quality output).</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics"" rel=""nofollow"">Eugenics</a>, coming from the greek for ""well-born"" or ""good"" race, is the application of artificial selection principles to humans. Just as with cattle or crops, there is an aim, it may be to increase height, remove genetic diseases, or promote a certain set of traits like blonde hair and blue eyes. Historically we can associate with a number of radical political ideologies, such as Nazism. Even <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization"" rel=""nofollow"">here in Sweden</a> (people tend to think of it as a very progressive and equality driven country) there was a program of eugenics until very recently, achieved by forcibly sterilising or coercing people in to it, for various reasons (racial purity, health, and antisocial behaviour). <a href=""http://www.pop.org/content/the-knife-in-the-closet-127"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's an interesting example</a> of a girl designated as being genetically inferior because her family had a history of alcoholism (that page gives a good history of eugenics too). The social and ethical problems of eugenics are obvious.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions a persons reproductive output is largely determined by their own choices and actions whereas under eugenics that choice is taken away and made by someone else and specifically with the aim of ""improving"" the quality of the population.</p>

<p><strong>So in summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>natural selection is the result of natural variance in fitness linked to traits</li>
<li>artificial selection leads to a change in traits, in a specifically targeted direction, decided and imposed by another organism (usually humans, I know of no other species which does this)</li>
<li>eugenics is practice of artificial selection on humans enacted by humans with the specific aim of improving quality: often for social, economic, or political reasons and is generally accepted as being against human rights these days.</li>

<p>I know that polypeptides are chains of amino acids monomers. But what is a ""monomeric polypeptide"" and what other kinds of polypeptides are there?</p>
","<p><em>Monomer</em> in this context means the protein has only one polypeptide chain. In some  proteins, after the individual chains have folded into their 3D or tertiary structure, they associate (generally non-covalently) into a higher order or quaternary structure. A protein with a quaternary structure containing  two copies of the same chain would be called a homo-dimer. One with one copy of each of two different chains is a hetero-dimer. </p>

<p>Haemoglobin is a well-known example of a protein with quaternary structure — it has two copies of the alpha- and two of the beta- chain.

Spectral sensitivity of cats indeed ventures into the UV, but not beyond ~320 nm. Their maximum is likely similar to ours, i.e., ~750 nm.</p>

<p>In the <strong>cat</strong>, however, the <strong>lens transmits a large portion of the UV light</strong> in the range of <strong>320 - 400 nm</strong>, while primates transmit virtually no light of these wavelengths. Figure 3 shows the lens transmission spectra of various species. At 50% transmission the second (dotted) line from the left is the cat (50% transmission at ~340 nm), while a primate (squirrel monkey, species representative for humans and other primates) in this graph is line number 7 from the left with (50% transmission at ~410 nm). Hence, <strong>cat lenses absorb less light in the UV region</strong>, but transmission is virtually <strong>nil at 320 nm</strong> (Fig. 3). Given that their cones, just like humans, are sensitive to UV, we can reasonably expect that cats can see in the UV region including wavelengths of 320 nm and up. Cats also have the 560 nm (red) cones, like we do, so their maximum wavelength is expectedly similar to ours (~750 nm).  </p>

"Can defibrillation be done with a car battery?","3531","","<p>Can successful <strong>defibrillation</strong> be done <strong>with a car battery</strong>? Is it POSSIBLE for this to work?</p>

<p>Let's say you are stuck on a very remote place and something happens to someone...</p>

<p>Moreover, can you jump start someone's heart using the battery of a car and the jumper cables, keeping in mind that:</p>

<ol>
<li>in order to start a stopped heart you need electrical current applied in a short period, like 20 ms, and at a relatively high tension (200v) and small intensity?</li>
<li>car battery provides low tension current (12v) at a relative high intensity (70-80A) and the period cannot be 20 ms, but around 200-300 ms giving the fact that humans are not able to react that fast.</li>
</ol>
","<p>In general, no.</p>

<p>Car batteries are designed to provide a large amount of amperage, to turn the starter with a high amount of torque via an electric motor.  Generally this is done at 12 or 24 volts.</p>

<p>The current recommendations for a defibrillator requires 200V, and a very small amount of amperage.  This is one of three settings in a standard defib procedure.  The second setting is 300V, and the final is 360V.  The point of defibrillation is not to provide power to the heart, it is to disrupt the heart's built-in electrical (biological) circuitry, such that the heart can go to rest (not beating).</p>

<p>Many cardiac events involve the heart beating in an uncoordinated manner, such that many or all of the muscle fibers in the heart beat in a manner that doesn't provide the squeezing action on the chambers to push the blood forwards.  Defibrillation seeks to correct such an uncoordinated beating by resetting the heart to rest, after which it will hopefully start beating again in a coordinated manner.</p>

<p>In short, attaching a car battery is more likely to cook the heart (if it even gets that deep) because it is providing too much power, and it is unlikely to disrupt the heart's electrical field because it is too low of a voltage.  With this in mind, one could theoretically attach enough electrical transformation equipment to a car battery to use it as a power source for defibrillation.  But there are other issues with such an idea.</p>

<p>Car batteries are not designed for the usage that would mesh well with a defibrillation machine.  Car batteries are designed to be recharged.  Your car battery basically drains pretty heavily upon starting a car, and then the alternator recharges it by harvesting mechanical power from the engine during your trip.  This heavy drain / heavy charge cycling is hard on batteries, and car batteries have been specifically designed to endure in such a scenario.</p>

<p>A defibrillator machine has a different use scenario.  Basically it sits idle for long periods of time, and when it does require charging, it gets electricity from a wall socket, at higher voltage (and generally lower amperage).  This means it tends to charge more slowly, which in general means longer battery life.  Also the battery is built differently, to hold charge better at the expense of not being recharged as quickly.</p>

<p>In short, a car battery is really the wrong tool for the job.</p>

"Why did life not evolve to use radio?","3493","","<p>We use electromagnetic communication everywhere these days. Cell phones, wifi, old-school radio transmissions, television, deep space communication, etc.</p>

<p>I'm curious about some of the possible reasons we have never seen biological systems having evolved to use electromagnetic, i.e. radio, for communication. The one obvious exception to this are organisms that generate their own light, i.e. bioluminescence. Cuttlefish are masters of this, and many other species as well.</p>

<p>It seems like bio-radio could have offered all kinds of evolutionary advantages for animals capable of using it.</p>

<p>Are their basic physical limits in chemistry, or excess energy requirements or something that would basically have made this impossible? Or was this perhaps just something that life never evolved to use, but would otherwise be possible in evolution?</p>
","<p>There is a very different mechanism for generation (and detection) of ultraviolet, visible and infrared light vs radio waves.</p>

<p>For the first, it is possible to generate it using chemical reactions (that is, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence"">chemiluminescence</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescence"">bioluminescence</a>) with a typical energy of order of 2 eV (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt"">electronovolts</a>). Also, it is easy to detect with similar means - coupling to a bond (e.g. using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin"">opsins</a>).</p>

<p>For much longer electromagnetic waves, and much lower <a href=""http://halas.rice.edu/conversions"">energies per photon</a>, such mechanism does not work. There are two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>typical energy levels for molecules (but it can be worked around),</li>
<li>thermal noise has energies (0.025 eV) which are higher than radio wave photon energies (&lt;0.001 eV) (it rules out both controlled creation and detection using molecules).</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words - radiation which is less energetic than thermal radiation (far infrared) is not suitable for communication using molecular mechanisms, as thermal noise jams transmission (making the sender firing at random and making the receiver being blind by noise way stronger than the signal).  </p>

<p>However, one can both transmit, and detect it, using wires. In principle it is possible; however, without good conductors (like metals, not - salt solutions) it is not an easy task (not impossible though).</p>

"What's the recommended maximum passage number for mammalian cells (NCI-H441)?","3485","","<p>Is there a generally accepted maximum number of times you should split and reseed mammalian culture cells before restarting cultures from new stock?</p>
","<p>This is a very good question and it highlights a very frequent misconception about cell culture and it is using the passage numbers as an indication of how well a cell is behaving. Although this can be a good barometer but it is misleading. Passaging can stress the cells if performed very frequently, although again that depends on how fast the cells are dividing. </p>

<p>You should not think of passage (and cell culture in general) in terms of the procedure itself but in terms of population doubling (PD) which can be calculated using the formula provided here (<a href=""http://www.sciencellonline.com/site/techsupport.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencellonline.com/site/techsupport.php</a>). I personally use [Log10(harvesting cell No/seeding cell No)/Log10(2)]. This should allow you to characterise your cellular behaviour between every passage and allows you to draw a cumulative PD graph. Once the cumulative PD versus time becomes non-linear, then you would know that the cells have changed behaviour and it might be best to use a fresh stock.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this method is that you are not relying on guess work and deal with solid numbers and allows you to predict when you should expect to start a fresh batch for passage. Although passage numbers can do the same job if you assume per passage, the cells have done a certain PD but this is more of a guess work and you can not track how well your cells are doing at a given time point. For example one of the main problems with using a passage as a measure is that you can passage the cells at 98% confluence to a fresh flask and although that counts as a passage but it is pretty uninformative in terms of cell behaviour and gives you no solid numbers and you can do this many many times and although you would have done high number of passages but your cells would appear ok. Although such an exercise is pointless and will probably stress the cells but it is just to make the point that passage numbers are not necessarily a very informative and quantifiable measure of how well the cells are doing or behaving hence PD and cumulative PD should be used. Another advantage is that since you are dealing with actual cell numbers, if you changed your cell culture flask size from lets say T-75 to T-25, you don't have to be worried about changes to your frequency of passage or having to make further guess work on how that has effected your cell behaviour.</p>

<p>My main advice is that you should keep you frequency of passage the same at least in the beginning (although keep an eye on the cell density as you don't perhaps want to let cells to be too over-confluent or unconfluent when passaging, depending on your specific methodology and what has been established in your lab), but count your seeding and harvesting density (cell No) and calculate the PD and cumulative PD and draw a cumulative PD vs time graph and monitor the behaviour of cells. This should give you a good indication of you cellular behaviour under the conditions you are working with them since guidelines are just that, guides and they can never substitute experimental characterisation of your cells under your conditions and handling method!</p>

<p>Imagine a piece of string. It has 6 marks on it (1-6 on the diagram) which divide it into 7 intervals (A-G). We are going to cut the string at one of the marks. We throw a die to decide which position to cut.</p>

<p>What is the probability that our cut will separate A and G? It's 100% since all single cuts will do this. </p>

<p>What is the probability that our cut will separate A and D? It's 50% since single cuts at 1,2 or 3 will do this.</p>

<p>What is the probability that our cut will separate A and B? It's 16.7% (1/6) since only a cut at position 1 will do this and the probability of throwing a 1 on our die is 1/6.</p>

<p>Think of the intervals (A-G) as genes and the cut sites (1-6) as possible crossing over events. If two homologous chromosomes are going to undergo a single crossover somewhere at random, then the closer together are the genes (intervals), the less likely is it that the crossover (cut) will take place between them. This assumes of course that the site of crossing over is chosen at random.</p>

<p>In the model presented here, if the order of the letters was scrambled and didn't know what it was but we were told the frequencies of occurrence of the separation of the intervals with random cutting we could deduce the order of the letters.</p>

"Why don't antibiotics affect mitochondria?","3465","","<p>Given that mitochondria are evolutionarily closely related to bacteria, and antibiotics kill bacteria, why don't antibiotics also kill mitochondria?</p>
","<p>The short answer is, as you found, that mitochondria are wrapped in a double membrane and are thus harder to penetrate with antibiotics.</p>

<p>The long answer is some of them do.  Good antibiotics target structures widely found on and conserved in bacteria that are not found in human bodies.  Some antibiotics are a little less specific and can indeed interact with other molecules.  The allergy to penicillin, for example, is caused by the immune system reacting to a ""novel"" protein formed when penicillin binds to the surface of red blood cells.  Some antibiotics can indeed harm mitochondria, but we tend not to use those and in fact wouldn't even call most of them antibiotics since we wouldn't use them because of their harmful effects.  <a href=""http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/192/192ra85"">Here</a> is a very recent report looking at some of the anti-mitochondrial effects of some antibiotics.

"Action potential and sodium channels","3462","","<p>In this <a href=""http://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/v/electrotonic-action%20potential"" rel=""nofollow"">video</a> on electro tonic potential, the tutor says that when the potassium channels open the potential drops from +40mV to -80mV, where the sodium channels have already closed at +40mV. </p>

<p>Now in that case, 
<strong><em>wouldn't the sodium channels that usually open at -55mV open up again when the potential is on its way reaching -80mV from +40mV, thereby making changes in all the potential differences that are occurring normally(according to the video)?</em></strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
","<p>The key to understanding this is to digest the fact that there are two gates blocking a normal sodium channel. These gates are called the <em>activation gate</em> (on the extracellular side) and the <em>inactivation gate</em> on the intracellular side. Both of these together, or any one of these alone, if closed, can block the sodium current from entering the cell.   </p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>resting state</strong>, the activation gate is closed and the inactivation gate is open. There is no influx of sodium. Owing to a neurotransmitter release, there is depolarization of the plasma membrane around the channel. As soon as the potential reaches a fixed threshold value, there is a change in the conformation of the sodium channel. The voltage is sensed by a <a href=""http://courses.washington.edu/conj/membrane/nachan.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">biophysical voltage sensor</a>, a part of the channel.  </p></li>
<li><p>At the <strong>threshold potential</strong>, both the gates respond by reversing their state. But owing to the biophysical structure, the response of the activation gate is faster than the response of the inactivation gate. What happens is that the activation gate quickly opens allowing the influx of sodium ions, generating the action potential. The inactivation gate is closing but before it closes, the activation gate has been open for some time and the action potential is already fired due to considerable depolarization. </p></li>
<li><p>After some time, the inactivation gate also closes completely, blocking the sodium influx. By this time, the potential is at the peak of the action potential, the potassium channels have opened, and the <strong>re-polarisation phase</strong> begins. Here the inactivation gate is closed, thouh the activation gate is still open above the threshold potential. As the potential dips below the threshold, again the gates reverse their states but they respond with different speeds. First, the activation gate closes while the inactivation gate is still closed, and then the inactivation gate opens. In this way, during repolarisation, no sodium influx occurs since atleast one of the two gates is always closed.  </p></li>

"Why our body does not produce polyunsaturated fatty acids?","3462","","<p>Our body does not produce two polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA): linoleic acid and alfa-linolenic acid.</p>

<p>I am thinking reasons for it.</p>

<p>Saturated fatty acids have more energy than unsaturated.
Saturated fatty acids do not need NADPH and some many other enzymes as unsaturated in beta oxidation.
This means that less storage places in the body needed to have energy in the form of saturated fatty acids such as for muscles and heart.</p>

<p>There are four main reasons why our body does not use PUFAs as the primary source of the energy but saturated:</p>

<ul>
<li>PUFAs lower metabolism and interfere with thyroid function</li>
<li>PUFAs spontaneously oxidize, speed up the process of glycation, since too much glucose</li>
<li>PUFAs decrease mitochondrial respiration - more oxygen and CO2, less lactate</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>where one reason is missing.</strong> </p>

<p>One complication of PUFA is</p>

<ul>
<li>PUFAs promote diabetes, cancer, inflammation and biological stress</li>
</ul>

<p>which cannot be thought as a reason why our body does not use PUFAs as the primary source of the energy.</p>

<p>There are positive sides of the PUFAs when they are used in other way.
- PUFAs replace trans fats and saturated fats in certain types of foods.
- PUFAs can help your body to eliminate high cholesterol levels
- PUFAs decrease the risk of heart disease</p>

<p>There are also some types of essential fats that your body cannot produce on its own - omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.
PUFAs are used to create these.
You can get PUFAs from vegetable oil, fish and nuts for instance.
Balanced diet is essential.</p>

<p>Normal lipid metabolism depends directly on food lipids.
Both the essential fatty acids and right amounts of PUFAs can be obtained from food.
Body converts the essential fatty acids to long PUFAs, which serve as the precursors of prostaglandins and leucotrienes for instance.</p>

<p>There are so many reasons why our body does not produce polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>

<p><strong>Why our body does not produce polyunsaturated fatty acids?</strong></p>
","<p>I think the reason is that there would be so much more oxidative stress in our body to convert PUFAs then to saturated ones.

<blockquote>
  <p>The secretory component of sIgA protects the immunoglobulin from being

  microbes that multiply in body secretions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what exactly does the secretory component do?  What is the secretory component?  Is IgA absorbed in the circulation of fetus? I remember reading it somewhere that it is not absorbed, at least in humans. Please answer these questions focusing more on humans. Though, information about other animals will be appreciated as well.</p>
","<p>It is!  Here is an <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257684/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">amazing review from 2011</a> that <em>literally</em> has all the answers.  I'm not kidding, <strong>all</strong> of them.  I would marry this review if I could.<sup>1</sup>  It also includes information on other animals.</p>

<p>The main takeaway is that IgA from milk is <strong>not</strong> readily absorbed by the infant body.  Secreted IgA is mainly to provide a protective coating for the mucosa while the infant is developing its own nascent immune system.  IgG passed along from the placenta (your <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/11089/4101"">other question</a>) provides the main source of absorbed antibodies.  As it says in the review:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Milk sIgA is not taken up by the infant’s intestinal mucosa. In fact, gut closure in humans occurs before birth and little immunoglobulin is absorbed intact in the intestine after birth. However, the presence of sIgA in the intestinal lumen is part of the protective function of the epithelial barrier in the intestine... Secretory IgA is considered to be the primary immunoglobulin responsible for immune protection of mucosal surfaces such as the intestine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of enzymatic activity, the digestive system will in indeed chomp up the antibodies; that's part of the reason breast feeding should continue as needed.  That's okay, because there's plenty to go around:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Much of the immunoglobulin consumed in an immune milk can be expected to be partially or completely digested, however some portion of the immunoglobulin will remain intact or at least partially intact and capable of binding to an antigen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out that immunoglobulins are moderately resistant to digestion, at least more so than other milk proteins.  There's a section in there detailing some experiments where Ab was given to individuals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In adult humans consuming a bovine whey protein concentrate, approximately 59% of IgG and IgM was detected by radial immunodiffusion from effluents from the jejunum, while 19% was detected in the ileum. These estimates of digestion of immunoglobulin compare with estimates of digestion of milk proteins in adult humans which are approximately 42% complete at the end of the jejunum and 93% complete by the end of the ileum, again underscoring the relative resistance of immunoglobulins to digestion in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digestive enzymes vary as to which antibody they prefer to digest, but at least some of them will technically digest the antibody, but still leave functional Fab fragments, which are still immunologically active and useful to the infant immune system.</p>

  by chronic alcohol abuse, though it is lessened by contemporary

","<p>I'll keep this short and simple. The direction of transcription (which determines which strand is used as the template) is controlled by the promoter, which is a region of specific DNA motifs at the 5' end of a gene. RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, which orients it on the correct strand and in the correct direction, after which it can proceed to transcribe the gene. </p>

"Transmission of epigenetic regulation through surrogate mother","3420","","<p>I know the basics of epigenetics, but I do not know how epigenetic mechanisms are transmitted from parents to children (or if there is even enough literature to derive a consensus). My question is relates to surrogate motherhood, in which an egg is fertilized <em>in vitro</em> and then implanted in the womb of a woman other than the egg donor. </p>

<p>Are all the factors that affect epigenetic mechanisms encoded in the genome? Is it possible for the surrogate mother's epigenetics to influence the epigenetics of the child/children?</p>
","<p>Epigenetic information is information that can be inherited through cell division that is not encoded in the DNA sequence. This includes, but is not limited to, DNA methylation and histone modifications (there is also non-chromatin based epigenetic information). A nice example is the centromere, the chromosomal region that binds the kinetochore and is important to attach chromosomes to the mitotic spindle during cell division. The location of the centromere on the chromosome is encoded by a specific nucleosome composition and does not seem to rely on the DNA that wraps around those nucleosomes: The DNA sequence at centromeres is not even conserved from chromosome to chromosome (with the exception of budding yeast), and there are several known examples of people and families where the centromere is in a different place. However, all the mechanisms for maintaining this epigenetic mark are encoded genetically. </p>

<p>As epigenetic information is transmitted through cell division, it is directly inherited from the biological mother (with the exception of e.g. the centromere, most epigenetic marks from the father's chromosomes are removed when sperm is created). </p>

<p>However, (some) epigenetic information can be <em>modified</em>. This is obviously important during development where gene expression patterns of a liver cell need to be stable but different from gene expression patterns of a neuron, even though both descend from the same cell. </p>

<p>There is evidence that the metabolism of the mother will influence the epigenetic program of the child; diet being one of the determinants. It has also been suggested that epigenetic changes may influence behavior. Thus, it is indeed possible for the surrogate mother's epigenetic state to influence the epigenetic information of the children.</p>

<p>A standing human is a dynamical system that is not in equilibrium so it requires a (closed loop) feedback system to maintain it. This means sensors in your body detect deviations from your desired posture and muscles contract to return you to it. The problem is that there is a lower limit to the movements you can detect i.e. you body moves a certain distance before your muscles respond and move it back. The result is that even when we try to stand absolutely still we are actually continually moving then correcting that movement.</p>

"How does water buffer a sudden drop in temperature?","3392","","<p>A property of water is that it is slow to heat and cool. According to my biology book, some energy from an increase in temperature would spent breaking hydrogen bonds, so that temperature does not rise too fast - helping a cell to maintain homeostasis. </p>

<p>As far as I can tell, this answer does not explain how a drop in temperature would be slowed down by water in a cell. How does water slow down heat loss? Is it just because it is difficult for the heat that is already inside the cell to leave? </p>
","<p>From pure biophysical viewpoint the question </p>

<p><strong>""Why does water buffer sudden temperature changes?""</strong> can be answered in the following way: </p>

<p><strong>Water has relatively high <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity"" rel=""nofollow"">specific heat capacity</a></strong>. This is the measure of the energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of a substance by one kelvin without a change of state occurring. ""Relatively high"" means that <strong>water can absorb more energy without noticeable (for the cell) increase in temperature</strong>.</p>

<p>Here are some heat capacity values from the above-linked Wikipedia article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Animal (incl. human) tissue   3500 Jkg<sup>-1</sup><br>
  Water at 25 °C    liquid  <strong>4181.3</strong> Jkg<sup>-1</sup><br>
  Methanol  liquid  2597 Jkg<sup>-1</sup><br>
  Ethanol       liquid  2440 Jkg<sup>-1</sup><br>
  Paraffin  wax solid   2500 Jkg<sup>-1</sup><br>
  Graphite  solid   710 Jkg<sup>-1</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Water has relatively high <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_thermal_conductivities"" rel=""nofollow"">thermal conductivity</a></strong>. This means that the <strong>absorbed heat is quickly distributed over the complete cell volume</strong>, leveling down the focal temperature increases in cell. Here are again some values for comparison:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Water <strong>0.6</strong> Wm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup><br>
  Wood 0.2  Wm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup><br />
  Paper 0.05  Wm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup><br>
  Glycerol 0.3 Wm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The follow-up questions:</p>

<p>""Why does water have relatively high heat capacity?"" and ""Why does water have relatively high thermal conductances?"" are not within the scope of this site. However, here exactly comes your explanation with hydrogen bonds in play (from Wikipedia):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hydrogen-containing polar molecules like ethanol, ammonia, and water
  have powerful, intermolecular hydrogen bonds when in their liquid
  phase. These bonds provide another place where heat may be stored as
  potential energy of vibration, even at comparatively low temperatures.
  Hydrogen bonds account for the fact that liquid water stores nearly
  the theoretical limit of 3 R per mole of atoms, even at relatively low
  temperatures (i.e. near the freezing point of water).</p>

<p>If the solution acquired proteases somehow, they would self-digest under the conditions the 'garbage enzyme' solution is stored at(room temperature, aqueous solution, nothing exotic like formaldehyde, months). The yeast itself by the time the fermentation is complete has died, destroyed by the acetic acid(or ethanol, depending) they created. Any digestive enzymes used by the yeast to dissolve proteins destroy themselves as the mixture matures and the yeast die off. </p>

<p>If the mixture starts with no digestive enzymes, there's no mechanism to get appreciable amounts active digestive enzymes. If the mixture does start with digestive enzymes(papaya or pineapple), either the yeast will eat them and then die or they will digest themselves and the yeast will eat the byproducts.

<p>It's a vinegar/alcohol blend, depending on how much oxygen is available during the fermentation, and it smells like whatever you put in it. If you used orange peels, it probably smells pretty okay. That's why it cleans. </p>

<p>If you are anxious to use real live proteases, there are powdered papaya/pineapple/etc powders you could reconstitute in water right before use. They are usually sold as meat tenderizer among other things. There are also blends of enzymes sold for pet urine deodorizing, and general purpose cleaning fluid with bacterial and enzymatic action. Formulating those at home is going to be fairly involved, but if you wanted an enzymatic cleaner you made yourself that's how to do it.</p>

<p>This is unique to each individual because it is a genetic (and therefore highly heritable) trait. Because it is in no way linked to mortality there is no selection pressure against greying hair.</p>

<p>The <em>reason</em> that the pigment is not longer produced is the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17917134"">gradual depletion of the stem-cell pool with age</a>.

","<p>Your question is based on a bit of confusion about electron acceptors that is very common and that drives microbiologists crazy. Energy (as ATP) is generated when electrons are moved from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. In respiration, the electron acceptor is inorganic -- oxygen for aerobic respiration or an inorganic molecule such as sulfate or nitrate for anaerobic respiration. Use of an organic molecule such as pyruvate as an electron acceptor is properly called fermentation. Both anaerobic respiration and fermentation are termed anaerobic because they don't use oxygen.

<p>Joking apart, what you call <em>wood wide web</em> is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network"" rel=""noreferrer"">mycorrhizal network</a>.</p>

<p>Mycorrhizal fungi are well known to botanists and ecologists. They are the fungal partner in the mycorrhiza, which is a symbiotic association between a fungus and a plant.</p>

<p><sup>Mycorrhizal hyphae (white) in a root</sup></p>

<p>The novelty about this <em>mycorrhizal network</em> is that, as it was demonstrated, plants can use it to exchange some chemical substances. And, in certain cases, this exchange can be used to improve disease resistance.</p>

<p>However, there is <strong>no electrical impulse</strong> in this process.</p>

<p>According to Song et al. (2010):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In theory, plants can also communicate with each other through underground common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) that interconnect roots of multiple plants. However, until now research focused on plant-to-plant carbon nutrient movement and there is no evidence that defense signals can be exchanged through such mycorrhizal hyphal networks. Here, we show that CMNs mediate plant-plant communication between healthy plants and pathogen-infected tomato plants (<em>Lycopersicon esculentum</em> Mill.). After establishment of CMNs with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus <em>Glomus mosseae</em> between tomato plants, inoculation of ‘donor’ plants with the pathogen <em>Alternaria solani</em> led to increases in disease resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This other research demonstrate that the mycorrhizal network can be used to warn neighbouring plants of aphid attacks (Babikova et al., 2013):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we show that mycorrhizal mycelia can also act as a conduit for signalling between plants, acting as an early warning system for herbivore attack. Insect herbivory causes systemic changes in the production of plant volatiles, particularly methyl salicylate, making bean plants, <em>Vicia faba</em>, repellent to aphids but attractive to aphid enemies such as parasitoids. We demonstrate that these effects can also occur in aphid-free plants but only when they are connected to aphid-infested plants via a common mycorrhizal mycelial network. This underground messaging system allows neighbouring plants to invoke herbivore defences before attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In both cases the mycorrhizal networks play an important role in exchanging chemical substances among the plants.  </p>

<p>The network has a <em>dark side</em> too: it can be used to deliver allelochemicals from one plant to another, greatly increasing allelopathy. According to Barto et al. (2011):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) form belowground networks that interconnect multiple plant species; yet these networks are typically ignored in studies of allelopathy. We tested the hypothesis that CMNs facilitate transport of allelochemicals from supplier to target plants, thereby affecting allelopathic interactions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally: don't rely on media to get scientific information, specially in these times of <em>alternative facts</em>. Sometimes you can get good information in the media, but good and accurate information is way harder to find (an example is this <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141111-plants-have-a-hidden-internet"" rel=""noreferrer"">BBC page</a> about the mycorrhizal network). However, in defense of that page in The New Yorker, there is <strong>no</strong> mention to electrical impulses.</p>

I've found this interesting bit about vitamin B12 and am looking at its implications:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Approximately 56% of a 1 mcg oral dose of vitamin B12 is absorbed, but <strong>absorption decreases drastically when the capacity of intrinsic factor is exceeded</strong> (at 1–2 mcg of vitamin B12) </p>

<p><strong>I'm trying to understand the implications of an intrinsic factor involved in B12 absorption.</strong> Lets say that a person gets vitamin B12 from both food and a single supplement pill. Will taking that pill ""use up"" the absorption factor and prevent food's vitamin B12 from being absorbed over time? </p>

<p>This is the first time I'm hearing of additional ""factors"" that may limit vitamin absorption in the human body. Is this common across vitamins, or is it B12 specific?</p>

<p>Thank you for your input!</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12"" rel=""nofollow"">Vitamin B12</a> (cobalamin) is a water-soluble vitamin required for homocysteine methyltransferase. In order to be absorbed, it must bind to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">intrinsic factor</a> (IF), which is produced by the parietal cells of the stomach. The absorption of the vitamin B12-IF complex occurs in the terminal ileum (of the small intestine). The quote just means that if there isn't enough IF, then you can't absorb vitamin B12.</p>

<p>There are many things that limit absorption of vitamins, and even vitamin B12. Because vitamin B12 is found in animal products, vegetarians and vegans may need to supplement it. Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease that destroys IF or the parietal cells, Gastric bypass surgery can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency. Anything that affects vitamin B12 absorption in the terminal ileum, such as in Crohn's, celiac disease, or enteritis, can lead to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12_deficiency"" rel=""nofollow"">deficiency</a>.</p>

<p>To answer your question, no. Yes, it will use some IF (provided you have IF), but that would allow your body to absorb vitamin B12. For people who have diseases mentioned above, they can take vitamin B12 via injections, subligually (under the tongue), or intranasal gels, according to the fact sheet you cited.</p>

<p>Because all the B vitamins and vitamin C are water-soluble, they are <a href=""http://www.sharecare.com/question/how-water-soluble-vitamins-absorbed"" rel=""nofollow"">easily absorbed</a> through the intestinal wall. Excess amounts are usually excreted in urine. I believe vitamin B12 is the only vitamin that needs to be bound to a factor, due to its larger size. It can be stored in the liver for several years. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) are absorbed with lipids.</p>

"How does a tree trunk sprout and grow after being cut?","3350","","<p>After I cut trees into logs and remove the branches in winter, they start growing. They sprout out and grow completely normal looking stems and leaves and maintain them all summer. The sprouts mostly appear around the cut branches.  Sometimes they last all winter and grow for another year. How does it find the energy and water necessary to maintain and grow these stems without ground connection and a water source? </p>

","<p>This is basically the same that happens after <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning"">pruning</a> and involves a basic hormonal regulation mechanism in the plants.</p>

<p>What happens is that the cut piece of the wood forms a new <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meristem"">meristem</a> which allows the growth of new organs. What’s important is that there is no other growth happening nearby, since that would hormonally inhibit any further growth. This is why such growths happen once you’ve cut the wood, not before (on the healthy stem). This inhibitory effect is known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apical_dominance"">apical dominance</a>, which has now been disabled.</p>

<p>As to where the energy and water comes from, to some extent it is stored within the branches themselves. That’s why you need to dry them before being able to use them in a fire. However, this growth is pretty limited. Further water is probably collected by condensation of water vapour in the air.</p>

"What part of food gives the blood red color?","3344","","<p>Roughly, what I know is, when we eat food it goes into our: Stomach > Small Intestine > Large Intestine > Rectum. So, it just moves through a digestive pipe.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is, <strong>what part of the food is responsible for blood's color and how does the food that we eat mixes with blood?</strong></p>
","<p>The red colour of blood isn't actually to do with food at all.  The primary purpose of the blood is to carry oxygen to all the cells that require it to release energy.  Red Blood Cells are filled with an iron containing pigment called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"" rel=""noreferrer"">haemoglobin</a>.  When it has oxygen bonded to it, haemoglobin  has a bright red colour - it is this that gives blood its red colour.</p>

<p>In terms of how food enters the bloodstream, it is first broken down into extremely small constituents.  This is done by mechanical action (i.e. chewing and the squeezing movement of your digestive system) and by chemical action through the use of enzymes.  Enzymes are proteins that are secreted by various glands in the mouth (and are therefore contained in saliva), stomach and both intestines.  These chemically break large food molecules down into small products such as glucose (sugar) and amino acids (protein-building blocks) amongst other things.  These then move across the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream, which are separated by only one cell:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4n3bt.gif"" alt=""Diagram of villus""></p>

<p>Unfortunately that's the best image I could find.  The intestine is everything outside of the pink layer (which is the wall of the intestine).  The small molecules are able to pass through the pink layer and straight into the blood stream.  The picture shows a fold in the wall of the gut, which increases its surface area so allows more molecules to diffuse across.  </p>

"Can ovulation and menstruation occur simultaneously?","3343","","<p>Is that possible that ovulation happens in the time of actual menstrual haemorrhage in human females - let say in a case that woman has 21 day cycle and her menstrual period is 7 days? </p>

<p>If yes, does it means that in this particular case the woman has lower chances to conceive?</p>
","<p>Ovulation and menstruation don’t happen in normally cycling women at the same time. A basic outline of the hormonal cycle that triggers these events will make this clear.</p>

<p><strong>Proliferative (a.k.a follicular*) phase</strong><br>
Beginning after menses (when the endometrium is thinned), the hypothalamus produces GnRH which stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce LH and FSH. These in turn stimulate ovarian follicles to develop. A dominant follicle produces estradiol which causes the endometrium to thicken (proliferate).</p>

<p>At a certain level of estrogen (actually estrogen/progesterone ratio), the feedback on the hypothalamus flips from a negative to a positive feedback loop. Thus, there is a GnRH followed by a LH surge. The latter triggers ovulation. Note that at this time the endometrium is stable due to relatively high estrogen levels. </p>

<p><strong>Secretory (a.k.a. luteal*) phase</strong><br>
After ovulation, the high levels of LH trigger formation of a corpus luteum from the tissues left behind after ovulation. The corpus luteum makes progesterone. This hormone triggers a change in the endometrium from a proliferative to a secretory state. Progesterone also provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, maintaining low levels of GnRH, LH, and FSH, so no new dominant follicles develop at this time.</p>

<p>If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum will eventually (10-12 days) degenerate and stop producing progesterone. It is this abrupt drop in progesterone that triggers the sloughing of the endometrial lining. You can see these hormone shifts in an illustration like this: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eoHt2.png"" alt=""menstrual hormones""></p>

<p>The decline of the corpus luteum is correlated with a decline in serum levels of ovarian hormones including progesterone, estradiol, and inhibin A. Release from negative feedback provided by these hormones at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary permits FSH to rise, and the cycle begins again.</p>

<p>You should now be able to see that: </p>

<ul>
<li>Around the time of ovulation, the uterine lining is not fully developed and is stable due to the hormonal milieu. Menstruation does not occur.</li>
<li>Around the time of menstruation, FSH and LH are suppressed in a way that is not conducive to ovulation. </li>
</ul>

<p>In theory, yes, of course there would be a lower chance of initiating a viable pregnancy (<em>implantation</em> rather than <em>conception</em> is the most obvious problem) were the endometrial lining to be unstable at the time of ovulation. The problem of <a href=""http://www.sart.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/News_and_Publications/Practice_Guidelines/Committee_Opinions/Luteal%20phase%20deficiency2012noprint.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">luteal phase deficiency</a> is along these lines. In this condition, the corpus luteum does not produce adequate progesterone during the luteal phase to develop the endometrial lining in such a way as to support a healthy pregnancy. However, ovulation and menstruation are still time-separated events for the reasons outlined above. </p>

<p>*Note that the first term is with respect to the endometrium; the second is with respect to the ovary.</p>

","<p><strong>Sperm are cheaper than eggs</strong> </p>

<p>According to Bateman's Principle the males of a species are (typically) more able to produce a greater variance in the number of offspring. This is because generally the males can produce many gametes and achieve many matings whereas females are limited by the number of eggs, resources, and time lost to pregnancy. Therefore, just by simple logic, it would appear likely that males have greater variance in mating success (strong/attractive males would be able to mate with many females while weak/unattractive males would have little to no offspring). See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateman%27s_principle"">Wikipedia for an introduction to Bateman's Principle</a>. Also see this paper about <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2460741"">sexual selection and mating success variance</a>.</p>

This is because we have a low <strong>dynamic range</strong> in our vision (relative to absolute brightness, but compared to camera CCDs we have a high dynamic range) - we have to adjust the light sensitivity to compensate for the overall brightness of the image.

<p>When you move your head, the black and white lines blur together which makes the overall brightness appear to be the average brightness of the black and white. So against that background your light sensitivity increases and the areas where the pixel tone is different from the average - the gray pixels of the face - start to stand out.</p>

<p>By reducing the brightness you can see the faint image in the background much more clearly...</p>

","<p>In the process of exocytosis materials which are about to be released are transported in small vesicles to the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane fuses with these vesicles and this sets the substances free on the outside of the cell.

<p>Every tree requires sunlight to grow but what limits the production of fruits to a certain season?</p>

<p>For example: Mango only grows in summer season, whereas banana grows in all seasons.</p>
","<p>Many plants start flowering (and subsequent seed / fruit production) based on light, temperature, and / or humidity changes, which tell them summer is near. That is when they need to grow fruit. Surely, there are plants trying to look for sunlight, pollinators, good conditions for seedlings, in the winter, but they are specially adapted, and thrive in their niche only through some season sensing similar to the summer-flowering plants.</p>

<p>At the Equator there isn't much difference between seasons and days, and there  should be no need for such mechanism. Bananas are suited to the Equator, meaning banana trees don't know what seasons are.</p>

<p>Plants in temperate climates care about seasons a lot. We put them in greenhouses and we play with their light, in order to force off-season flowering. Tomatoes are not kept in the greenhouse because we don't like them shivering outside, but because we want to fool their temperature-sensing organs that summer is here.</p>

<p>At the Tropics there is an important difference in the amount of rain water and a smaller change in day duration. Mangoes are more suited to the Tropics, meaning they care about seasons.

","<p>No, this will not happen. mRNAs are inspected in the nucleus before they are exported into the cytoplasm (at least in eukaryotes), where transcription and translation don't happen at the same place.

<p>This is still too broad a question.  a well sealed, sterile plastic usually has a use by date, but can probably be used more than a year after you receive it.  But these cases are not usually the issue.  </p>

<p>Its sterile medium and chemicals, each of which needs to have their own due date.  LB can be used months after autoclaving, but antibiotics break down chemically in weeks (ampicillin 1000x stocks lose their potency in a month).  Even in the refrigerator Agar plates show colonies after a couple of months and dry out quickly.  </p>

<p>So more details would be necessary and the case by case policy is the rule.</p>

<p><em>added in response to comments</em></p>

<p>Its really a matter of how well they are sealed. An autoclaved bottle will stay sterile forever, until something gets into the bottle - it depends on how well you have sealed things up and the storage conditions.  For stuff sterilized in lab I would tend to use it within a couple of months. For eppendorfs we'd tend to sterilize a few hundred in a beaker and not worry about them... </p>

<p>Our experiments were working with purified protein were only medium sensitive to bio-contamination; they would be done in a few hours and then sterile filtered again.  If you were purifying RNA for instance you would be much more paranoid I'm sure. </p>

<p>If you start to see contamination I would lower the use date and or improve your protocol.  </p>

<p>Plastics that come sterilized and sealed by the manufacturer in 3-5 mil plastic bags have really long use by dates and I've used them for up to a year after we received them.  </p>

"Why do we go blind for a few seconds after switching off the light?","3292","","<p>At night, when I switch off the lights, I always seem to go blind for a while. The room becomes pitch black and I am unable to see anything. After a while, however, my vision slowly recovers and I start to see things around me again. I always have to wait a while before my vision returns to that functional state. </p>

<p>I am interested in knowing the mechanism behind this phenomenon. What do we call it?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong><br>
The eyes need to adapt to the low lighting condition after you switch off the lights, a process called <em>dark adaptation</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
The process behind the reduced visual function when going from bright ambient light to low-lighting conditions is caused by a process called <em><a href=""http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/courses/perception/lecturenotes/light-adapt/light-adapt.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dark adaptation</a></em>. The visual system works on a huge intensity scale. The only way to do that is by <strong>adapting to ambient lighting intensity</strong>. </p>

<p>The sensitivity of our eye can be measured by determining the <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(eye)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">absolute intensity threshold</a></strong>, i.e., the minimum <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">luminance</a> of a stimulus to produce a visual sensation. This can be measured by placing a subject in a dark room, and increasing the luminance of the test spot until the subject reports its presence. </p>

<p><strong>Dark adaptation</strong> refers to how the eye recovers its sensitivity in the dark following exposure to bright light. The sensitivity of the visual system increases approximately 35 times after dark adaptation.  </p>

<p>Dark adaptation forms the basis of the <strong><a href=""http://www.cambridge.org/fi/academic/subjects/life-sciences/neuroscience/duplicity-theory-vision-newton-present"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Duplicity Theory</a></strong> which states that above a certain luminance level (about 0.03 cd/m2), the cone mechanism is involved in mediating vision, called photopic vision. Below this level, the rod mechanism comes into play providing scotopic (night) vision. The range where two mechanisms are working together is called the mesopic range, as there is not an abrupt transition between the two mechanism.</p>

<p>The dark adaptation curve shown below (Fig. 1) depicts this duplex nature of our visual system. The sensitivity of the rod pathway improves considerably after <strong>5-10 minutes in the dark</strong>. Because after you switch off the light the rod system is still inactive, you are unable to perceive much. The reason why rods are inactive is because they are said to be photo bleached. <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_and_recycle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Photo bleaching</a></strong> refers to the visual pigments in the rods and cones to become used up because of the high light intensities when the light was still on. The pigment needs to be regenerated and that takes time. </p>

<p>On <a href=""https://www.wageningenur.nl/en/show/Characteristics-of-genetic-markers-Codominance-of-alleles.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">wageningenur.nl</a> (random website I never heard of before), they define dominant and codominant markers based on gene expression suggesting that the terms dominant and codominant used for markers have the same definition than those used for allelic effects on the phenotype (dominance, recessivity, overdominance, etc..).</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<li><p>What are the definitions of <strong>dominant</strong> and <strong>co-dominant</strong> genetic markers?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you please offer examples for each type and explain why they fit in one or another category?</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the genetic pattern of homozygotes can be distinguished from that
  of heterozygotes, then a marker is said to be co-dominant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definition seems to be different from the one used to explain allelic effects. For example, as you would know a SNP is basically a feature of the DNA sequence. It is more of a genotype rather than a phenotype. Markers are supposed to be phenotypes (can be a molecular phenotype too for example a marker for stem cells etc). SNPs do create allelic variants but they may or may not contribute to different phenotypes. Consequently, the allelic variants may exhibit dominance or co-dominance with respect to each other. So, going by the definition used in classical genetics, you cannot call SNP as a ""dominant""/""co-dominant"" marker.</p>

<p>That is a weird usage of the terminology but people have done it so the deed cannot be undone. I would avoid future usage of such misleading terms. Having said that SNP would fit the definition of a ""co-dominant marker"" if it is observed by DNA sequencing . </p>

<p>Personally, I would consider RFLP a technique and not a marker <em>per se</em>. RFLP can be used to differentiate SNPs but sometimes it may not even resolve different strongly visible phenotypes (its efficacy basically depends on the polymorphism at restriction sites). Heterozygotes however, would have a different band pattern compared to homozygotes. So it should be a ""co-dominant"" marker.</p>

<p>AFLP, as far as I know is simply PCR amplification of restriction fragments. It would be ""co-dominant"" for the same reasons. However, just a PCR based screen would not differentiate between homozygotes and heterozygotes and would thus be a ""dominant"" marker. Now again, these are techniques and not, in a true sense, ""markers"" whereas SNPs and microsatellites are actual DNA features. So these cannot be even compared. A technique, depending on its resolution, can be ""dominant"" or ""co-dominant"" as per these definitions.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>For general interest</strong></p>

<p>I would want to reiterate that these definitions, for some reasons mentioned above, are quite flawed and are therefore misleading (they may have been okay at certain point of time but are obsolete now). Please avoid their usage in your papers and reports and if possible point these flaws out, so that they do not propagate.</p>

"How can CI repressor both activate and repress $P_{RM}$ promoter found in $\lambda$ phage?","3243","","<p>I'm reading <a href=""http://www.jbioleng.org/content/6/1/9"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a paper</a> where the authors constructed a toggle switch that uses bidirectional $P_R/P_{RM}$ promoter found in the $\lambda$ phage. There are 3 binding sites - $O_{R1}$, $O_{R2}$, $O_{R3}$ - located between the two promoters. CI is expressed by $P_{RM}$ and CI dimers bind to these binding sites:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R3NZt.png"" alt=""Bidirectional lambda phage promoters""></p>

<p>What I don't get is that <strong>CI seems to function as both an activator and a repressor of $P_{RM}$</strong>.</p>

<p>First, my understanding was that $P_{RM}$ is an inducible promoter activated by CI which also represses a constitutive promoter $P_R$:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CI is a transcriptional activator of $P_{RM}$, thus producing positive feedback.</p>
  
  <p>CI preferentially binds to $O_{R1}$ and $O_{R2}$, repressing the constitutive promoter, $P_R$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it is also stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In high concentrations, CI binds to $O_{R3}$ and acts as a repressor to $P_{RM}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to suggest that the CI can function either as an activator or as a repressor depending on the binding site bound; specifically, CI dimer binding to $O_{R1}$ and $O_{R2}$ will repress $P_R$ and at the same time activate $P_{RM}$, while CI dimer binding to $O_{R3}$ will repress $P_{RM}$. Is this correct?</p>

<p>I (a computer scientist by training) was always given the impression that a transcription factor is either inherently a repressor or an activator of a promoter, but this doesn't seem to be the case here. I would expect that e.g. CI would act as a repressor to $P_R$ and an activator to $P_{RM}$ regardless of the binding site. So why does CI binding to $O_{R2}$ (and $O_{R1}$ as well?) activate $P_{RM}$, while binding to $O_{R3}$ represses it - why the inconsistency? Note that I'm primarily interested in this from the modeling perspective.</p>

<p>What I also don't understand is whether or not $P_{RM}$ promoter is inducible or constitutive (e.g. in the absence of bound transcription factors, how leaky is it)?</p>
","<p>There's no rule that says a transcription factor must be either a repressor or an activator. The lambda repressor (CI) is in fact a repressor and activator of transcription, depending on where it is bound and to what promoter you are referring to. I know your question isn't directly about lambda phage, but I think this mechanism may be best explained in the context of where it was first invented: nature. So, I will try to briefly explain how the lambda repressor's dual role allows regulation of its own expression and controls lysogenic induction.</p>

<p>The cI gene is under the control of the PRM promoter. The PRM promoter is weak because the sigma factor of RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme has low affinity for it. Binding of RNAP to PRM, and thus transcription from there, at a reasonable level requires an activator. There is another protein involved in this process as well, called Cro, that can also bind the OR operators. The cro gene is under the control of the PR promoter. PRM is not a constitutive promoter because it requires an activator. I have heard PR called constitutive because it is a strong promoter and can bind RNAP without an activator. But, at the same time, it is under the control of the lambda repressor. I suppose it depends on which definition of 'constitutive promoter' you use.</p>

<p>The OR operators are not identical and thus CI and Cro bind them with different affinities: CI has the highest affinity for OR1, followed distantly by OR2 and OR3, while Cro binds OR3 with highest affinity. Binding (of any two molecules) is dependent on both their affinity to each other as well as their effective concentration. At lower concentrations, CI can only bind OR1 and OR2 cooperatively. That is, each lambda repressor dimer binds to another, forming a tetramer, with one half binding OR1 and the other binding OR2. Binding both operators as tetramer allows for a stronger interaction. At higher concentrations, CI can bind OR3. Furthermore, OR1 and OR2 are located in the PR promoter, while OR3 is located in the PRM promoter.*</p>

<p>Most lambda genes are under the control, directly or indirectly, of the PR and PL promoters (PL is similar to PR, but the promoter itself is not directly involved in cI regulation). When lambda exists as a prophage, its DNA is integrated into the host genome and most of its gene expression is repressed. This requires CI repression of PL and PR. When the viral DNA is first integrated, there is no CI in the cell (because it is a phage gene). Expression of cI is initially dependent on a different promoter (PRE), but I won't get into this here. Once CI concentration is high enough, it can bind to OR1 and OR2 as a tetramer. Binding here physically blocks the PR promoter and prevents expression of cro (CI acts as a repressor of PR here). It also interacts with RNAP (actually the sigma factor) and facilitates is binding to the PRM promoter, which leads to further cI expression. This process is commonly called recruitment: since CI is bound tightly to the DNA and has some affinity for RNAP, it can create a stronger interaction between the DNA and the RNAP-CI complex. Simply put, it induces the PRM promoter and is thus functioning as an activator of cI transcription. As CI concentration increases, it will bind OR3 more (which is located in the PRM promoter) and repress the PRM promoter by physically blocking RNAP from binding. In these ways, cI can autoregulate its expression level, both positively and negatively.</p>

<p>When the lysogen is in some kind of stressful condition, normal host processes will result in proteolysis of CI and its DNA/sigma binding domain is cleaved from the dimer- and tetramerization domains. This means that CI can no longer oligomerize and is no longer able to bind cooperatively to OR1 and OR2. The result is loss of PRM activation (leading to vastly reduced cI expression) and also a loss of PR repression (leading to cro expression). Cro can then bind OR3 and represses PRM. Lack of PR repression also allows expression of early phage genes (which are under the control of PR).</p>

<p>Note that a similar situation occurs at the PL promoter region, and binding of CI to both OR and OL as well as CI octomerization is important in prophage regulation, but that seems even further out of the scope of your question. Hopefully you can see how he lambda ""repressor"" actually functions as both a repressor and activator of transcription. If this kind of stuff interests you, I highly recommend a textbook called Molecular Biology of the Gene by Watson et al.</p>

<p>*See comments. Upon further research, the PRM and PR promoters both overlap OR2 (Autoregulation and Function of a Repressor in Bacteriophage Lambda, Ptashne et al.), as the diagram in the OP shows. It appears that the -35 region of both PRM and PR overlap OR2 by 2 and 3 base pairs, respectively. That led me to wonder that if CI binds to OR2, which is in PRM, wouldn't it physically inhibit RNAP binding and thus repress transcription? Well it appears that CI interacts with the same region of sigma that is responsible for binding the -35 region of PRM (Amino acid substitutions in the -35 recognition motif of sigma 70 that result in defects in phage lambda repressor-stimulated transcription, Kuldell and Hochschild). So instead of blocking sigma binding here, it enhances it.</p>

It registered the temperature of course, but it wasn't a negative perception.</p>

<p>I wonder, what is an explanation? Is it simply because our faces are used to the cold, because we almost never cover them? Or is it some evolutionary phenomenon?</p>
","<p>In response to cold your body causes blood supply to the skin to drop in the whole body. This is to conserve heat, but results in us feeling really cold. Exercising reverses this, resulting in an increased blood supply to the skin in order to remove excess heat and in this case we feel hot. </p>

<p>As mentioned, the head receives a large blood supply, and continues to do so despite other tissues being restricted. This is particularly as a result of the brain requiring a lot of oxygen and glucose. This keeps our head warm. </p>

<p>This phenomenon is why hats keep us warm and are important in cold weather, we lose a lot of heat from our head.</p>

<p>It is also likely that the skin on our head contains less cold receptors, as these aren't likely to be required.

","<p>Ecology has two meanings. The <strong>popular</strong> and the <strong>scientific</strong> meaning.</p>

<p><strong>Ecology: the popular definition</strong>: Here the term ecology is probably quite poorly defined. To my gut feeling, the concept relates to the concept of global change. It encompass many fields such as biology (ecology (in the scientific sense), evolutionary biology and conservation biology especially), ethics and moral, politics, meteorology, public policy, ...</p>

<p><strong>Ecology: the scientific definition</strong>: Ecology is a subfield of biology and earth sciences that studies <em>interactions</em> among organisms and their environment. <em>interaction</em> is an important word here.</p>

<p><strong>Biology</strong> has a much broader meaning. Biology is the science that studies life. Biology studies the structure, the ecology (impact on their surrounding), the evolution, development biochemical processes, etc.. of living things. Biology is a very big field of science. A researcher in biology will probably not really consider him/herself as a biologist but rather as a molecular geneticist, a neurologist, a epidemiologist, a plant physiologist, a biochemist, a bioinformatician, a system biologist, etc.. For example, I would appreciate to consider myself as a population geneticist rather than as a biologist as there are many fields of biology I know nothing about. For example, I am a pretty bad naturalist.</p>

<p><strong>In short</strong>, ecology is to biology what optics is to mechanics is to physics. Some people may not like this comparison as mechanics might take a larger part of physics that what ecology does to biology. Earth scientists may not like this comparison as well, as they are part of ecology without necessarily feeling like being part of biology. But anyway.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It shows that indeed ecologist are interested in the <em>interaction</em> between organisms and between organisms and their abiotic environment. Matthew Fraser says ""he's not only interested in how they work"". 'How they work' is obviously an extremely inaccurate sentence. A less misleading reformulation would be: I am not interested in everything about the biology of marine animals, ""I am especially interested in how animals interact with each other and how they interact with the environment"", but obviously that is less exciting for the reader. The goal of Matthew I guess was to create the interest and the excitation of the reader (or audience) on ecology and for this purpose he kinda implied as ecology being more than biology, while ecology is only a subfield of biology.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.neuro.cjb.net/content/24/39/8441.full"">Binzegger et al.

Binzegger et al. describe it as:</p>

  <p>They assumed that axons simply connect in direct proportion to the
  occurrence of all synaptic targets in the neuropil. The rule can be
  extended to provide more precise estimates by taking into account the
  detailed morphometrics of the dendritic and axonal trees of the
  different neuronal types.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Binzegger et al., in the simplest form of Peter's rule, the number of synapses in a cortical layer are evenly distributed across the potential target neurons. So there would be a direct proportionality between synapses and targets.</p>

<p>The second sentence of the quote above is the meat of the Binzegger paper. They also present a mathematical model of a more complex and realistic variation of Peter's rule which takes into account different types of postsynaptic neurons and the fact that not all cells receive synapses.</p>

And the twist is, it still codes for methionine or formylmethionine<sup><a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS0248-4900%2803%2900033-9"" rel=""noreferrer"">1</a></sup>. In rare cases, such as heat shock, other codons like CUG, ACG, AUA and AUU, are also used for initiation <sup><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3105428/"" rel=""noreferrer"">2</a></sup>. It is so because start codon itself is not sufficient to begin translation, other nearby factors, like the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, or initiation factors, also play a role. One such factor is the initiation tRNA. At the beginning of translation, tRNA<sup>Met</sup> or tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> binds to the small subunit of ribosome. So, whatever be the start codon, the first amino acid will be methionine<sup><a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fbies.950030108"" rel=""noreferrer"">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Now, coming back to the main question, N-terminal methionine, although being the first amino acid, is not present at N-terminus of all proteins. This is because of a process that is known as post-translational modification. After a polypeptide is completely translated from mRNA, it is modified at different places by different enzymes, which are regulated by different (internal or external) factors. There are more than a hundred post-translational modifications known<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification"" rel=""noreferrer"">4</a></sup>, one of which is the removal of methionine from the N-terminus of a polypeptide. N-terminal methionine is removed from a polypeptide by the enzyme methionine aminopeptidase<sup><a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1110%2Fps.04679104"" rel=""noreferrer"">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The question which immediately comes to mind is <em>Why are proteins modified after translation?</em> Well, there can be various different causes of it. First of all, post-translational modifications are regulated by many factors, and this process is called post-translational regulation<sup><a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Special:BookSources/978-3-527-30496-7"" rel=""noreferrer"">6</a></sup>. Another point is cell targeting. Attaching different groups to polypeptides makes them more stable at their target location. For example, by attaching lipid molecules to polypeptides (in a process called lipidation) makes the polypeptide more stable and suitable for cell membranes<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification"" rel=""noreferrer"">4</a></sup>. A yet another factor is increasing stability. Yes, you read it right, in some cases, N-terminal methionine can destabilize a protein! For example, an extra N-terminal methionine not only destabilizes but also disrupts the native folding configuration of $\alpha$-lactalbumin<sup><a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1998.2362"" rel=""noreferrer"">7</a></sup>. There can be numerous other factors too, which promote removal of N-terminal methionine from polypeptides.</p>

<p>Thus, in short, <strong>No, not all proteins contain a methionine at their N-terminus</strong>. I hope this helps!</p>

"Are there predators evolved to eat puffer fish?","3187","","<p>Puffer fish is known for having a anti-predation defense mechanism of having toxin-exuding spikes.</p>

<p>Are there predators which evolved specifically to prey on puffer fish? (presumably, by evolving immunity to the toxin)?</p>

<p>I know that sharks eat them, but I doubt sharks evolved to be immune specifically to puffer fish toxin, since their evolutionary development preceded puffer fish's.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraodontidae#Natural_defenses"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> has some revealing information here: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not all puffers are necessarily poisonous; Takifugu oblongus, for example, is a fugu puffer that is not poisonous, and <em>toxin level varies wildly even in fish that are</em>. A puffer's neurotoxin is not necessarily as toxic to other animals as it is to humans, and puffers are eaten routinely by some species of fish, such as lizardfish and tiger sharks. Also, Japanese fish farmers have grown nonpoisonous puffers by controlling their diet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that susceptibility to tetrodotoxin varies a lot from one animal to another, and so some natural variation might allow a reasonable amount of predation to occur.  I also wonder whether the variation in the amount of toxin in the fish implies that the fish are often depleted. </p>

<p>There are cases of animals who have evolved a resistance to Tetrodotoxin, but for the most part its may the predators you are thinking of.  The toxin is synthesized by a symbiotic bacteria and is found not only in fugu but also blue-ringed octopus, rough-skinned newts and some sea slugs.  These animals probably all began with enough intrinsically low sensitivity to the toxin to take on the symbiont and probably evolved to be completely insensitive.  To find a predator that would have co-evolved a similar resistance you would look for a predator that particularly favors the envenomed animal.  In the case of the rough skinned newt, <a href=""http://news.stanford.edu/news/2008/march12/newts-031208.html"" rel=""nofollow"">its suspected that the common garter snake is an example of such co-evolution</a>. Others may be out there to discover - its probably difficult to watch marine animals to know what their typical predators are.  </p>

"Black/dark-red smooth West African worm, full of red blood","3185","","<p>This chap was strolling across my bathtub in Freetown, Sierra Leone, one day after very heavy rains and flash flooding. From its course, it appeared to have come up the bath plug from the drains. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IZRGY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IZRGY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It's about 2mm-3mm wide at the fattest points and 1mm wide at the thinnest points (which vary as it moves). It's maybe around 10cm in length. The picture's not the clearest but (to the naked eye) it looked almost completely featureless - smooth (no visible rings), and no obvious hooks or features at either end. </p>

<p>It was moving to the right from the point of view of the photo, and moved by narrowing and elongating unmarked segments about 2-4cm long each rather than the whole body. I say segments, since it seemed to be the same sections each time, but when it wasn't moving there was nothing to distinguish these segments. Its movements began by elongating the very front 2-3cm, then it'd feel around, come down, and other (unmarked) segments in the body would expand and contract to bring the rest of the body after it.</p>

<p>While I'm pretty sure it's not either of the two most notoriously nasty West African parasitic worms (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loa_loa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Loa Loa</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracunculus_medinensis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Guinea Worm</a>), I didn't want to to take any chances, and we had nothing to isolate or store it in, so we carefully squashed this one after taking photos then cleaned the plug hole with boiling water and cleaner. </p>

<p>On squashing it, it burst in a very similar way to a recently-fed mosquito or bed bug with a splatter of what looked exactly like regular human/mammal blood. I've not seen this before from a worm. Each 5mm or so of worm body contained about as much blood as a well-fed mosquito.</p>

<p>I've done a little browsing of species of bloodworm but didn't find any obvious matches.</p>

<hr>

<p>This might be unrelated, but the bathroom in which this worm surfaced has for several weeks had a small but constantly replenishing population of tiny flies like this, which I never questioned because they look almost exactly like regular drain flies. There's usually 1-3 of these flies on any given day, even after wiping out all of yesterday's flies, and I've not seen them anywhere else in the country. In this image it's about 3mm from wingtip to wingtip - much smaller than the worm.</p>

","<p>There are not so many potential candidate worm groups with similar appearance, namely: (free-living) flatworms, Nemertea and annelids.</p>

<p>While there are several terrestrial and freshwater flatworms, some of which are quite long, they do not approach such an elongated vermiform body shape and their mode of locomotion is different. There are around two freshwater nemerteans in Africa, neither of which looks like your worm, and in any case most nemerteans move by gliding using their cilia.</p>

<p>So the remaining group is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annelid"" rel=""nofollow"">Annelida</a>. There are three groups of annelids relevant in this context: polychaetes, oligochaetes and leeches. Polychaeta are predominantly marine and normally have more or less pronounced parapodia (""limbs""). Some of the do behave according to your description, but they are very <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=arenicola&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">characteristic</a> in their appearance and you would not expect to find them in a bathtub.</p>

<p>What remains are oligochaetes and leeches. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=leech&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">Leeches</a> are more or less dorso-ventrally flattened and have very prominent suckers. Moreover a fed leech (from which you would expect large quantities of blood) would look swelled (the gut in leeches has diverticula).</p>

<p>So, the only worm group I can reasonably suggest is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligochaeta"" rel=""nofollow"">oligochetes</a>. In fact your worm looks and behaves very much like a common <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?isch&amp;q=earthworm"" rel=""nofollow"">earthworm</a>. It is very typical of them to be highly mobile during and after rains and their blood pigment is <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=ad4rDwD_GhsC&amp;pg=PA18"" rel=""nofollow"">hemoglobin</a> (i.e. red). The only contradiction is that your worm had no clear true segmentation, but I believe, in some forms it is easy to overlook it.</p>

<p>The fly is indeed some species of Psychodidae.</p>

"What is the use of eye banks, if eyeball transplants do not exist at present?","3179","","<p>Corneas are donated and transplanted, but not the eyeball. </p>

<p>I don't understand. What is the purpose of donating a cornea without an eyeball to a blind person?</p>
","<p>No-one can re-implant an entire eye, because the optic nerve has been severed in one who has lost an eye. A cornea can't be grafted to a glass eye. But blindness isn't only caused by loss of the entire orbit. It's also caused by cloudy corneas, which is the purpose of eye-banks.</p>

<p>The optic nerve is a cable of nerve fibers that carry  visual information from the eye to the brain. In adult mammals, any damage to the optic nerve caused by injury or disease tends to be permanent, because the cells that form the optic nerve cannot regenerate. Any injury or disease that involves optic nerve damage can lead to permanent loss of vision. Obviously the loss of an eye would sever the optic nerve.</p>

<p>However, if the future holds success for optic nerve regeneration, it would also open the door for entire-eye transplantation. In which case, a new cornea might come in handy.</p>

"Why have humans evolved conciousness?","3179","","<p>Why did humans/animals evolve to become self-aware of their own thoughts.  That is, why don't humans act and compute like a machine, or walking zombie.  In my mind, such creatures would still be as smart and equally capable of surviving, the only difference being they don't experience the phenomenon of self-awareness. (To understand my question think: unconsciously sleep walking)</p>
","<p>There have been many proposals over the years as to why human consciousness has emerged and how, or even what it is.  </p>

<p>Most of us will not be surprised to know that there is no consensus about an answer here.  Its hard to draw a trend from a single example.  </p>

<p>Here is a little survey of the one's I've heard. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>We are intelligent because we have opposable thumbs and can use tools, which evolved our brains.  This is an old one - maybe as old as Darwin's time.  I think its mostly ignored now because so many animals - including pandas and other non primates have opposable thumbs or use tools or both.  (monkeys and chimps use tools, and recently crows have also been observed to use tools.)</p></li>
<li><p>brain size.  We do have a large brain to body size ratio.  There are other animals with similar ratios and they don't have internets.  </p></li>
<li><p>We are 'self-aware'.  That is to say we recognize ourselves as an individual.  <a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/32/5/329/"" rel=""noreferrer"">It was proven that other primates can recognize themselves</a> in mirrors (putting a red dot on their forehead. when they see their reflection, they touch their own forehead).  So that's not exclusive either.  its not a bad idea, but so far it doesn't seem to make the </p></li>
<li><p>'We ate something' I once read a discussion of <a href=""https://www.greenpassion.org/index.php?/topic/20997-humans-primates-psychedelics/"" rel=""noreferrer"">how humans might have ingested psychotropic plants or fungi</a>.  As you can see, this was 2010.  Its not the worst idea, but its hard to prove.  Lots of experiments on cats since the '60s have not produced cat's who care to tell us if they are intelligent.  Maybe they are just too smart in the first place.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>These theories, from when I was a student are so discounted now, you can't find too much record of anymore since they were pre-internet and also they seem so unlikely now.  </p>

<p>More modern theories have locked onto <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence#Models"" rel=""noreferrer"">social configurations of human societies which drive intelligent adaptations</a>.  This is stemming from observations that human evolution (the rate at which genetic variants are retained in the gene pool) <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2410101/"" rel=""noreferrer"">are accelerating since humans have become social</a>.  </p>

<p>These new theories while standing on some amazing evidence are still feeling around in the dark - stuff about how social interactions have created a preference for intelligence-like traits. There is probably something to that - once intelligence gets a toehold it is a clear advantage.  But how did it show up only once and why us? I think that's the hard part that science has, for the moment, given a rest. </p>

<p>This of course depends on what type of cell it is and the activity of the individual in question. The calculation should be fairly simple, as we know that ATP hydrolysis release about 30 kJ/mol. Hence, the question could actually be re-phrased to $""$At any given moment, how much ATP does the human body have?$""$</p>
","<p>ATP burned per minute is not a useful number because the turnover is so high. 2000 kcal/day is dozens of kilograms of ATP so obviously ATP is turned over more than once a day, but there's probably more than one molecule of ATP being passed around between all the ATP synthases.</p>

But arguing with someone about that, he says that, for that matter, every cell needs of others to live in some way or another, or that they can be kept alive and sometimes reproduce in a petri dish, without the need of the organism.

<blockquote>
  <p>The word organism may broadly be defined as an assembly of molecules functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#Biology"">properties of life</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Viruses are specifically excluded, as they depend on a host cell to fulfill all the functions of life.)</p>

<p>While cells extracted from a multicellular organism like a plant or a person may be able to be cultured <em>in vitro</em> for a time, they cannot survive independently - they require the intervention of humans (or very well-trained monkeys) to obtain nutrients and oxygen, and process/remove waste. A unicellular organism like a bacterium, for example, can handle these functions on its own - it can either synthesize or find a source for its own nutrients, and can reproduce on its own to create more organisms.</p>

<p>The key difference is being <em>self-sustaining</em>. An organism needs to be able to feed itself, take care of its waste, reproduce a full version of itself, respond to stimuli, etc. (see the ""properties of life"" link above). A single cell from a multicellular organism cannot do all that without assistance (kind of like a virus, actually), while a true unicellular organism can.</p>

"Is death by cyanide the same as suffocation?","3160","","<p>I started the night off by reading about ""what does drinking the Kool-aid mean"" this lead to a wikipedia article which described the horrors of the Jonestown cult mass suicide/murder in the 1970s. This was followed by reading about some of the references cited, and eventually me coming up with a biology question.</p>

<p>The murder/suicide used Cyanide. Reading the description of how it is described here: <a href=""http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/how-cyanide-kills/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/how-cyanide-kills/</a> makes me wonder if death by Cyanide is equivalent of suffocation. I think a biology background, doctor or nurse would be suited to answer this question.</p>
","<p>In suffocation or asphyxiation you are actually deprived of breathing oxygen. The arterial blood oxygen concentration decreases (hypoxemia) which is detected by the chemoreceptors of the carotid body and aortic arch. This induces a neuronal response in the medulla that increases respiratory rate, force of contraction and relaxation of respiratory muscles and heartbeat rate. Simply put, you get panicked. Prolonged suffocation may lead to seizures, cardiac and respiratory arrest and death.</p>

<p>Cyanide poisoning is an example of histotoxic hypoxia resulting from tissue poisoning by $\rm CN^-$. Unlike other forms of hypoxia, where the concentration of oxygen is less in tissues, in cyanide poisoning, the concentration of oxygen is actually perfectly normal in ECF and ICF. It is the cell which is unable to utilize the oxygen present in it. As a result the arterial blood doesn't lose much oxygen to the tissues which themselves have adequate oxygen, resulting in an increase in $\rm HbO_2$ concentration in blood.
Thus your skin gets cherry red, not blue like when you get deprived of breathing oxygen. That is due to increase in concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin in blood due to lack of breathing oxygen.</p>

<p>Here is what happens at the molecular level.</p>

<p>The $\rm CN^-$ ions diffuse into the mitochondria. They have high affinity to the ferrous ion of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c which is an electron carrier involved in the Electron Transport Chain, one of the phases of cellular respiration where $\rm ATP$ is generated from $\rm NADH_2$ and $\rm FADH_2$. And it is this process which actually requires oxygen. The inhibited cytochrome c  is no good at transporting electrons, thus no $\rm ATP$ molecules are generated from ETS. And, the oxygen molecules waiting for those electrons to get reduced remain empty handed explaining the increase in oxygen concentration. Remember, ETS occurs in almost all living cells except few like RBC which get their major share of ATP from the highly inefficient anaerobic glycolysis. $\rm ATP$ is of utmost importance to the cardiac muscles, the brain, respiratory muscles etc. With no $\rm ATP$ your heart muscles and respiratory muscles can't contract and you will go into sudden cardiac and respiratory arrest. It causes seizures and even can result in coma as the brain is deprived of energy. Death is inevitable if a high concentration of cyanide gets into your blood.
The symptoms of panic are not usually seen unless the victim himself knows he is poisoned . Well, that is due to your CNS which stimulates a fight/flight situation. The effects like cardiac and respiratory arrest, seizures and coma are similar to those of suffocation because it is due to low $\rm ATP$ production in both cases.</p>

<p>PS: I am short of reputation to add important tags to enhance searching, e.g.: <code>ELISA</code>, <code>validation</code>   </p>
","<p><strong>Background:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>There are a lot of recipes to extract protein from human tissues out there, but all of them boil down to one thing; preserving the tissue proteins as much as possible while obtaining a reasonable yield for downstream applications, using extraction buffer, extra techniques, and by adding protease inhibitors  </li>
<li>ELISA is one of the those downstream applications that you might be interested in, but one important question? is the sample matrix that you have already obtained valid for the ELISA assay? keep in mind, your sample is not serum, it is a mixture of tissue, extraction buffer, and protease inhibitors, and other things as well  </li>
<li>Two known assays are usually performed to address the above question. These are, spike-and-recovery (SAR), and linearity-of-dilution (LOD), and these two assays are specific to the analyte that you want to measure in your samples, e.g., cytokines, factors, Igs, etc...and specific also to the tissue, and assay kit as well  </li>
<li>Often times, you are interested in performing these two assays with minimum resources as much as possible, i.e., less time, less kit materials, and, most importantly, less sample material. This can be quite challenging and it depends on many issues that is out scope of this post to discuss them all  </li>
<li>If you are interested in performing these two assays using only one 96-well ELISA plate and examine validity of different sample matrices, sample buffer (lysis buffer or sometimes called extraction buffer) for a certain analyte, say X, then this scheme below is for you:</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technical Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In this scheme, recovery is examined in 3 types of solutions; <code>assay buffer</code>, <code>sample buffer</code> and <code>samples</code>. These are different in their complexity. Typically, the assay buffer is usually optimized to detect the standard protein provided with the commercial kit  </li>
<li>The idea of <code>spike-and-recovery</code> is that you add a certain amount from standard stock solution into the wells containing the solution to be tested (e.g., sample buffer or samples) and measure them, to see whether you can recover that amount again, and how much you can recover from it in %. If, for any reason, you couldn't recover that amount in comparison with a control well, where that same amount was added into assay buffer, then this means that something in the test solution is not in favor of the assay. The specific amount you add into the wells is called <code>spike</code>, and it should be the same amount across all tested wells (try to be consistent). Make sure that the added amount when diluted in the well, its final concentration should still be measured by the assay and lie inside your standard curve. E.g., if your standard curve is from 4- 4500 pg/mL, and each well has 100µl of sample, if you want now to add spike into that sample well, you may add whatever amount you want that will still give you at the end a reading inside the standard curve, you may choose to add 10µl from the highest stock which is 500pg/mL, so you end up here with 1/10, that is 50pg/mL, which is fine as it lies inside the 4-500pg/mL range. Alternatively, you can add 50µl sample + 50µl spike (500pg/mL) and would end up with 1/2 dilution (which is the same in this scheme), that is 250pg/mL, which is also fine. So it is up to you to choose, keeping in mind the final concentration should lie inside your standard curve  </li>
<li>For the <code>linearity-of-dilution</code>, it is obvious that you need a high concentration solution that you can make two-fold (or whatever fold you like) serial dilution from and its reading should still lie inside the standard curve. The best candidate for this is the high spiked wells. The <code>LOD</code> would tell you about the effect of different dilutions on the precision of the assay  </li>
<li>For <code>SAR</code> and <code>LOD</code> you will get at the end an average percentage from 3 samples at least (calculation example will be provided later), I added a fourth sample, but this fourth can be a different sample type, say samples from tissue culture, so it is up to you to re-design this scheme and be innovative   </li>
<li>Choosing the best dilution is not an easy task, it is not without compromises sometimes. For example, if you have a harsh sample buffer, you may not have good recovery at 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 dilutions of the <code>sample buffer</code> in <code>assay buffer</code>, whereas almost good recovery is achieved at 1/16, then this dilution factor is most probably the one you should go for in your assay. On the other hand, 1/16 might not be detected by your ELISA assay, which is limited by its sensitivity. Here, the <code>E</code> wells can give you a clue whether you detect something in these unspiked samples or not, that's why I recommend you include at least one sample of high expected value of the analyte in question (this is not easy sometimes to predict) in this scheme, here this is sample 3. One more thing, if you get good recovery at 1/16 DO NOT go to 1/32 or 1/64, as it is obvious that with these higher dilutions you are reducing the chance of the analyte's detectability as it is limited by your assay's sensitivity  </li>
<li>In most of the cases, you will see that the dilution factor of good recovery of the <code>sample buffer</code> in columns 3 and 4, will coincide with that of the <code>spiked samples</code> in columns 5, 7, and 9. This will give you the assurance that you are in the right direction. If sample 4 is extracted by a different <code>sample buffer</code>, then it is clear that should not expect to end up with the same dilution factor (please, be more reasonable!)</li>

"recombination frequency problem","3151","","<blockquote>
  <p>Three loci C, D and E are located on the same chromosome in this

  recombinants between C and E?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that it should be less than 30% (10%+20%) but the answer given is 26%. I don't understand how they figured that out.</p>

<p>Edit :</p>

<p>The frequency of recombination is &lt;30% because of the chance that a crossover happens between C and D &amp; also between D and E. The probability of that to happen is 2% (10/100 X 20/ 100)
So, why is it 26% instead of 28% ?</p>

<p>Another posssibility : Am I totally off the track ?</p>
","<p>I got $26$% as the answer.  </p>

<p>To get a recombination between C and E, there are two possible mechanisms:-   </p>

<ol>
<li>C and D produce a recombinant, but D and E remain linked, therefore the final genotype will be a recombinant considering C and E(Chiasmata between C and D). Here $P_1=P_{CD}\times P'_{DE}$ where $P$ is the probability of recombination and $P'=1-P$ is the probability of linkage.Hence $P_1=0.08$</li>
<li>C and D remain linked but D and E undergo recombination (Chiasmata between D and E). Here, $P_2=P'_{CD}\times P_{DE}=0.18$ </li>
</ol>

<p>If there is a chiasmata between both C and D, and D and E, the resultant will not have a recombination in C and E locus due to double crossing over. If there is no crossing over, there will be no recombination at either loci.</p>

<p>The net probability of recombination $P_{CE}$ will be the sum of these two, as any of these possibilities can occur to give a recombination between C and E. $P_{CE}=P_1+P_2=0.26$  </p>

<p>And Biogirllajja, your calculation (the Edit) was almost correct, but you have to subtract $2$% from both $10$% and $20$%, because, both of them include the probability of crossover at one loci, including the case where the other loci has also crossed over. Hence, you need to subtract it from both, and then add to get $26$%. Tell me if you want me to expand on my explanation or provide some clarifications.  </p>

<p>If we simply add the map distances, we get the actual map distance which disregards the possibility of double recombinations. All map units greater than 10cM have significant chances of double crossovers between them, and hence, the observed recombination frequency would be less than the expected 0.1. Hence, for distances greater than 10cM, the observed frequency of recombination will not be the same as (map distance/100).</p>

The testis has to protect the sperm as they proceed to the epididymis where they mature. The maternal reproductive tract has to protect its eggs both before and after fertilization and thus has developed specialized mechanisms to modify the body’s response to foreign antigens. These unique challenges require different solutions and lead to unique immune privilege mechanisms. However, although microenvironment and the stromal cells that carry out the particular function may vary between tissues, and consequently the mechanisms that promote regulation may be unique to that cell or tissue, the goal is the same: limit collateral damage to preserve tissue integrity and maintain homeostasis to the extent possible, without compromising host defense.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>People and other primates are exquisitely sensitive to funnel web venom but, intriguingly, other mammals such as mice, rabbits, guineapigs, dogs and cats are relatively immune and often survive 100 times the human lethal dosage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is the funnel web spider venom so much more lethal for humans and primates than other mammals?</p>
","<p>First, we need to understand that neurons have special proteins embedded in their membranes called ion channels. These allow dissolved ions such as sodium, potassium, and calcium to pass from one side of the membrane to the other. Neurons use these channels to control their electrical activity.</p>

<p>Peptide neurotoxins such as the one produced by funnel spiders (robustoxin) work by having a shape and charge configuration that is complementary to ion channels, and thus they will bind to these channels and affect the way they operate (often by simply blocking the channel). Robustoxin seems to operate by <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9560455"">removing sodium-channel inactivation</a>.</p>

<p>There is a bit more information about the primary toxin on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_atracotoxin"">Wikipedia page for delta atracotoxin</a>. The intended target of this toxin seems to be insects, where it interferes with potassium and calcium channels. In mammals it interferes with sodium channels, but it seems to be particularly potent in primates. Why are some species affected more than others? </p>

<p>Not all ion channels are built the same. From species to species, we see a huge array of genetic differences that affect both the shape and functional properties of these proteins. Ion channels which happen to have a shape and charge configuration that is highly complementary to robustoxin will adhere to it more firmly, and thus be more affected by it. </p>

<p>So did we just get unlucky and happen to have sodium channels that perfectly fit robustoxin? That seems to be the most likely answer, given that Australia probably has no native spider-consuming primates. Perhaps someone else can suggest other arachnid predators that might be an intended target for robustoxin?</p>

What biological constraints (if any) would limit how large a spider could grow, given ample food and no predators?</p>
","<p>The standard view on this is that the size of terrestrial arthropods like insects and spiders  is limited by the atmospheric concentration of oxygen. This is because they rely upon diffusuion of oxygen into the 'blood' or haemolymph via a system of tubes called trachea that open on to the body surface at the spiracles. As the body grows larger the proportion that has to be taken up by the trachea gets larger. Consistent with this is the presence of fossil giant dragonflies, <em>Meganeura</em> dating from the Carboniferous era when oxygen levels were at an all time high. However you will find that if you go to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meganeura"">the Wikipedia page for Meganeura</a> that this idea has been disputed, so the answer may be that no-one really knows. </p>

"How efficient is the sodium-potassium pump ?","3106","","<p>I am reading about transportation of ions in a cell. It is necessary to transport sodium back out and potassium back in, against their electrochemical gradient. This task is carried out by sodium-potassium pump, which transports three sodium ions out across the cell membrane for every two potassium ions carried inward. The source of energy for this transport process was hydrolysis of ATP.
My question is the order of the efficiency of a sodium-potassium pump.</p>
","<p><strong>I couldn’t find a value for this but I have calculated an efficiency of 84 %.</strong></p>

<p>Caution: this seems too high to me, so I show below my calculation, fully dissected, in case anyone can spot an error.</p>

<p>First of all the parameters. Ion concentrations are:</p>

<p>internal Na<sup>+</sup>  = 12 mM;
external Na<sup>+</sup> = 140 mM;
internal K<sup>+</sup>   = 140 mM;
external K<sup>+</sup>   = 5 mM;
and membrane potential = -60 mV (negative inside the cell)</p>

<p>I use these values for constants:</p>

<p>gas constant R = 2 cal mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup></p>

<p>Faraday constant F= 23,062 cal mol<sup>-1</sup> V<sup>-1</sup></p>

<p>and I’ll assume that the temperature, T, is 37℃ = 310 K</p>

<p>The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump uses 1 molecule of ATP to move 3 Na<sup>+</sup> out of the cell and 2 K<sup>+</sup> into the cell.</p>

<p>The efficiency of the pump is therefore energy required to move these ions/energy released by ATP hydrolysis.</p>

<p>How much energy is needed to move the ions? In each case there is a contribution from the fact that the ions are moved along a concentration gradient (the chemical component) and from the movement along a gradient of electrical potential (because of the membrane potential). In considering these components we have to think about whether energy needs to be used when the ions move, or whether it is released.</p>

<p>For the chemical component we can use</p>

<p>ΔG = RTln(ratio of concentration, inside and outside), where ln = natural logarithm</p>

<p>The sign of this ΔG will depend upon how the ratio is expressed (in/out or out/in) but the absolute value will be the same. So I calculate an absolute value and then deduce the sign of the free energy change.</p>

<p>For Na<sup>+</sup> ΔG = modulus(2 x 310 x ln(12/140)) = 1,523 cal mol<sup>-1</sup></p>

<p>Since Na<sup>+</sup> is being moved up a concentration gradient, work must be done so the free energy change is positive.</p>

<p>Applying the same formula and logic for the movement of K<sup>+</sup>:</p>

<p>ΔG = 2,065 cal mol<sup>-1</sup>. </p>

<p>(This value is greater than that for Na<sup>+</sup> because the concentration gradient is steeper.)</p>

<p>Next I calculate the electrical components using:</p>

<p>ΔG = zFμ, where z is the charge on the ion = 1 in both cases, and μ is the membrane potential (in volts).</p>

<p>So for both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> the absolute ΔG value is 1,383 cal mol<sup>-1</sup>. </p>

<p>However, in this case Na<sup>+</sup> is moving out, against the membrane potential while K<sup>+</sup>  is moving in with the membrane potential. Thus the value of ΔG is positive for Na<sup>+</sup> but negative for K<sup>+</sup>.</p>

<p>Now I combine the chemical and electrical components to get the net free energy change per mole of ions moved:</p>

<p>Na<sup>+</sup> ΔG = 1,523 + 1,383 = 2,906 cal mol<sup>-1</sup></p>

<p>K<sup>+</sup> ΔG = 2,065 -1,383 = 682 cal mol<sup>-1</sup></p>

<p>Now I consider how to combine these two values. Each cycle of the pump uses 1 ATP to move 3 Na<sup>+</sup> and 2 K<sup>+</sup>. Therefore each mole of ATP moves 3 moles of Na<sup>+</sup> and 2 moles of K<sup>+</sup>.</p>

<p>Energy from 1 mole ATP that is used to move ions = (3 x 2,906) + (2 x 682)</p>

<p>= 10,082 cal </p>

<p>= 10.1 kcal</p>

<p>How much energy is released from hydrolysis of 1 mol of ATP? Estimates vary but a commonly accepted value seems to be 12 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup></p>

<p>Thus efficiency of the pump = 100*(10.1/12) = 84%.</p>

<p>I think the free energy of ATP hydrolysis depends on ATP concentration, pH, and the amount of Mg present. For a well-fed brain, this is around 14 kcal/mol (see Journal Of Physical Chemistry B, 114 (49), (2010). 16137-16146). This gives an efficiency of around 70%, still too high but better...</p>
