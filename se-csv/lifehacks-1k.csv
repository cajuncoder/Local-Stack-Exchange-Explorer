"How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?","512113","","<p>I'm just getting over a cold, but my nose remains very stuffy / blocked. This makes sleeping difficult: I toss and turn or simply can't fall asleep at all. I've tried blowing my nose and using various decongestants, but nothing seems to do the trick.</p>

<p>What can I do to help clear my nose/sinuses so I can sleep?</p>
","<p>For immediate relief, there are two similar things that I will try.</p>

<p>First, I <strong>take a hot shower</strong> (make the shower as hot as you can withstand). Make sure to <strong>breath in and out deeply</strong> to fill your nasal passages and your lungs with steam. If that doesn't immediately make me feel better, I will also use a pot of boiling water. Just boil the water, drape a towel over your head (helps trap steam) and <strong>breath in the steam</strong>. This will help a lot.</p>

<p>One last tip is to keep your <strong>head elevated while sleeping</strong>. Don't use extra pillows, try to elevate your entire body from the waist up, or you can use books under your bed to make it like a <a href=""http://www.gosouthernmd.com/store/store/catalog/suppliers/66/lg/hospital_bed.jpg"">hospital bed</a>.</p>

"Open a suitcase with a numeric lock when you forgot the key code","378685","","<p>I have heard that there are ways to open a numeric locks commonly found in suitcases even when you have forgotten the code.  This could be ways to open the lock (without breaking it obviously) and other ways of of solving the situation of the suitcase being locked.</p>

","<p><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/39225/#39236"">Anaximander's answer</a> to a question on travel.SE explains the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzRSgfqXxOY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">biro technique</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your suitcase closes with a zip, then it can be opened with a normal biro (the ubiquitous cheap Bic office biro works particularly well). Simply hold the biro so it points parallel to the zip, with the nib end pointing into the zip teeth (I find about 60 degrees works). Then press down. The pen disengages the teeth of the zip, and you can pull them apart by running the pen or your finger along the zip. </p>
  
  <p>To reclose, simply pull the zipper over the opened part, and then back again. This works even on those suitcases with two zip pulls that lock together. Travel security like this method because it's fast, basically undetectable, and doesn't require any special tooling or any co-operation from the lock manufacturers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be a solution if knowledge of the lock's code will be revealed later (e.g. when a travel companion returns from an outing) allowing the zip tabs to be released and the zip teeth to be re-interlocked for normal operation.</p>

"How to jump start a car without another car","336889","","<p>There have been a few times when my car battery has died. Luckily, there has always been another car around to jump start me. I've always been scared that there will be a time when my battery dies and there is no one around to jump start me. <strong>How can I jump start my car without another car?</strong> </p>

<p>I have jumper cables in my trunk, but is there anything else that I should carry if I want to jump start my car alone?</p>
","<p>Depending on how low your battery is, there is a way to start a car if you have a <em>manual</em> transmission, and that is to push-start the car.</p>

<p>Follow this procedure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the ignition(/key) to the drive-position, i.e. the normal position it is in when driving</li>
<li>Put the car in 2nd gear, and hit the clutch and hold it </li>
<li>Get someone to push/pull the car so that you have a little speed on the car</li>
<li>Release the clutch swiftly, and the car will most likely start </li>
</ul>

<p>If the car is moving too slowly, it will not work, but you don't really need to have a lot of speed either. It can also be done whilst in reverse, but it's a little trickier to steer and handle car then.</p>

<p>Please do use 2nd gear and the clutch pushed in. It's a lot harder to start if in 1st gear, or if the car is in gear!</p>

<p>I have followed this procedure a lot of times with success, but mainly on slightly old cars.</p>

Using the mouse directly on the table usually results in a less responsive mouse. A couple sheets of paper makes the mouse responsive, but hard to move due to the mouse sticking to the paper.</p>

<p>Getting an actual mousepad is usually hard, because I move around with my laptop a lot and don't want to always bring a mousepad with me. What can I use instead of a mousepad?</p>

<ul>

<li>Approximate the size of your basket with your hand and tear a circle out of the paper towel bout an inch (+/- 2cm) wider than the basket size.</li>
<li>Place the paper into the basket and push the center down to touch the bottom.</li>
<li>the ""buckled"" edged should then be folded into an accordion (similar to the shape of a normal filter) -- this will help to maintain a ""wall"" for the water and grounds so they do not overflow into the drink.</li>
<li>Place the coffee grounds into the basket in a normal fashion and brew.</li>
</ul>

<p>No further work is needed. The strength of the coffee may vary a bit from what you are used to due to the thickness of the paper towel, but some coffee at 6am is better than <strong>NO</strong> coffee!</p>

<p>1) reseal the wood (but this is not a permanent solution.  Eventually the smell will seep through again).</p>

<h3>Household Chemicals</h3>

<p><strong>Nail Polish Remover</strong></p>

<p>Apply a small dab of nail polish remover on the ink spot and dry it with tissue paper</p>

<p>You can also soak the paper in nail polish remover if the spot is large.</p>

<p><strong>Bleach</strong></p>

<p>You can cover the spot in bleach.</p>

<p>This works similarly to white out, as it only works on white paper.</p>

<h3>Other solutions</h3>

<p><strong>Toothpaste</strong></p>

<p>Applying baking soda toothpaste on the ink with a toothbrush and wash it off with water</p>

<p>Avoid gel toothpastes</p>

<p><strong>Shaving Cream</strong></p>

<p>Use regular shaving, not gel, in the same way as toothpaste</p>

<p><strong>I Do Not Have A Fever</strong></p>
","<h1>No,</h1>

<p>there is not a reliable hack to measure the body temperature in a sensible way.</p>

<p>We have to distinguish two case where an exact body temperature may matter:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a rise in body temperature at all?<br>
<em>We won't be able to tell whether a body temerature rose to more than 37.5 °C (99.5° F) - the lower limit of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"">fever</a> - without a thermometer measuring at 0.1° precision.</em></li>
<li>Is there a threatening rise in temperature?<br>
<em>Fever greater than 41.5°C (106.7°F) usually comes from a serious unlerlying disease and may cause harm to our body. In this case we need to seek medical advice. We won't be able to tell without a thermometer if that was the case already.</em></li>
</ol>

<h1>But,</h1>

<p>of course there a limited ""hacks"" that may tell us something is wrong, and we may have a fever.</p>

<ol>
<li>Other people tell us we feel ""warm"".<br>
<em>It is important to realise that we can not feel our own temperature, as our hands get warmer with the fever as well, and we can only feel a difference in temperature in relation to our skin temperature. With some experience we may be able to feel that <strong>somebody else</strong> hase an almost normal body temperature, may have fever above 39°C, or has a high fever above 40°C.</em></li>
<li>Our usual room temperature suddenly feels cold.<br>
<em>Now this is very limited, but on a rising body temperature we subjectively feel cold, but as soon as the temperature falls we start to sweat. Therfore this will not tell us anything about our absolute temperature.</em></li>
<li>The heart beat rate may rise.<br>
<em>According to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebermeister%27s_rule"">Liebermeister's rule</a> the cardiac frequency rises by 8 to 10 beats per minute for every Celsius grade rise in body temperature. Obviously this rule is only applicable in case we rest, we do know our normal heart beat rate, and there is no other underlying cause of an altered cardiac frequency. The precision of this rule is more than doubtful.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>So whenever we have the feeling that we may have a fever we should go and measure our body temperature with a medical thermometer. All else will not really tell us much more than what we already know: we may be ill today.</p>

<p>I have tried using a scraper in the past, but that will usually scratch the paint badly. Sandpaper will also work at removing the mess, but again it damages the paint. I have used acetone in the past, but since it is a paint remover, it only makes sense that it will damage the paint.</p>
","<p>I use grease. Something thick and oily is helpful, because it adheres to the fibres of the tape and makes it hard for it to attach to a surface. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.thriftyfun.com/Removing-Duct-Tape-Residue-on-a-Car.html"">Some people</a> say use gasoline or other oily substances.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I looked around and found I had the following options. WD 40, Olive
  Oil, Carnauba wax. The WD40 did not work for me. What did work was to
  repeatedly soak the area in olive oil, then rub aggressively with a
  microfiber cloth and then I put carnauba wax on top of it which
  finished the job. The oil and wax slowly dissolved the tape glue. It
  took repeated rubbing over the area. In my case it took 45 min. but it
  got all the tape residue off and the finish was fine.</p>

  don't bother with anything else.</p>

"How to quickly remove a splinter","83062","","<p>Whenever I get a splinter, I have trouble getting it out. I pinch and pull at it. I bite it.  I usually can't get it out for a while. When I can't get it out, it hurts to put pressure on the spot where the splinter is.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a quick and safe way to remove it from my finger (or toe). I want the method to only involve things I can easily find around my house. I also want it to be able to get out in no more than 30 minutes (the faster, the better). Bonus points for reducing pain, but speed is my top priority.</p>
","<h3>General considerations</h3>

<p>General measures for successfully removing splinters are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take it easy - in a hectic rush the splinter may break and will then be much harder to remove.</li>
<li>Do not put pressure on it as it only will push it deeper into your skin,  or even it may break.</li>
<li>Try to find out what material the splinter is.  </li>
<li>In case the splinter is not easily accessible (foot, right hand in case you're right-handed) get help from another person.  </li>
<li>Seek a doctor if the skin around a splinter shows inflammation.  </li>
<li>Always seek a doctor in case you can't remember your last tetanus shot. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Pain</h3>

<p>Don't worry much about pain. It will only hurt when you push the splinter (which you shouldn't do) but only little if at all when you pull it. As soon as the splinter was removed the pain will stop immediately. </p>

<p>If pain persists or gets worse you may have a broken splinter remnant in your skin. In case it also swells or the skin gets red you will have an infection which should be treated. See a doctor then.</p>

<h3>Case wooden splinter or metal splinter sticking out</h3>

<p>In the usual case where you can see the splinter base still sticking our of the skin, you may grab it and remove it <strong>gently</strong>, taking care it does not break. Use any tool you find to securely hold it while pulling it along its entry angle. Consider disinfecting (e.g with alcohol or a lighter flame).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VoiNS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Special splinter tweezers (in my experience a ""Feilchenfeld"" design forceps is best)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H8SuG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>Eyebrow hair tweezers are great too.</p></li>
<li>Fine tweezers from your toolbox may work in case its tip is not deformed.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case the splinter does not come out very easily: <strong>do not pull harder</strong> - it may break. Put your skin in warm soapy water.</p>

<h3>Wooden or metal splinter not sticking out or broken</h3>

<p>In this case, we still may be able to grab it by making the opening it entered the skin a bit wider. In this case, we must <strong>disinfect our tools</strong>. Softening the skin by holding it for 10 minutes in warm soapy water considerably helps.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use two tweezers, one to widen the hole in your skin, a second one to grab the splinter.  </li>
<li>Use a sharp needle or blade to go underneath the splinter and lift it a bit. Then grab it with a tweezer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cactus spine or plant thorn</h3>

<p>These ""splinters"" are much harder to remove as they may break very easily, or they may have barbed spines designed by nature to not come out.</p>

<p>To remove these we always have to soften the skin by immersing in soap water before we start pulling with methods above.</p>

<p>Many small superficial spines or thorns may be removed using tape and pulling them out.</p>

<h3>Glass splinters</h3>

<p>Glass splinters are tricky as glass breaks very (very!) easily on grabbing. Once it was broken it will produce many tiny glass fragments that then may be so hard to remove to require surgery.</p>

<p>Therefore removing a glass splinter may better be done by a professional.</p>

<p>In case we try  by ourselves we need to be <strong>very careful</strong> to not hold it too firm and to prevent it from breaking.</p>

"How to keep bread fresher for longer","76229","","<p><strong>How do you keep bread fresh</strong> (lasting to/beyond the actual expiration date quoted on the packaging) as the bread I purchase always goes stale/moldy within a couple of days of opening.</p>

<p>I've heard that freezing the bread is a viable alternative, but I'd like to steer clear of, that as I don't want to have to take the bread out of the freezer the night before to make a sandwich the next day because it needs to defrost, not to mention the fact that the bread will be soggy the next morning anyway.</p>

<p>I do try to keep it in its original packaging (as suggested in <a href=""http://bread.com/content/keeping-bread-fresh"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a>), yet it seems to go stale/moldy regardless of where or how it is stored.</p>

<h3>Clarification</h3>

<p>This is packaged bread that you can buy from the supermarket. I always buy sliced bread and it varies from white/wholemeal. The bread would look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dMgax.jpg"" alt=""Tip Top Bread""></p>

<p>It could be the temperature, but I keep it in a bread bin and out of damp/moist places.</p>
","<p><strong>It's all about location, location, location!</strong></p>

<p>There are a couple of things that will aid  the growth of mold and bacteria and it is best to try and prevent these conditions being met in order to prolong the freshness of the bread. The things that I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Heat</strong> - Don't allow the bread to be in a warm / hot location, room temperature is fine.</li>
<li><strong>Light</strong> - Try to keep bread in a dark place like in a <a href=""http://www.tesco.com/direct/home/bread-bins/cat11320052.cat"">bread bin</a> or just in a cupboard away from both natural and artificial light.</li>
<li><strong>Moisture</strong> - Keep the bread away from any moisture and try to prevent moisture getting onto the bread, again this can be done by using a bread bin or a cupboard with only dried goods such as pasta. Also always redo the packaging in order to keep any air and moisture out.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if getting a bread bin is an option then I would suggest that, and suggest that it be kept away from windows to avoid any sunlight heating it up and turning it into a bread sauna. <strong>Do not store the bread in a fridge</strong> as this will only increase the speed at which it will go stale but it would prevent mold - not really a good compromise but that is down to you.   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Refrigerating the bread speed up the crystallization of the starch molecules which is one of the main reasons for bread going stale and this happens much more quickly when just above freezing temperature as opposed to being at room temperature. <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/does-refrigeration-really-ruin-bread.html"">See here for details</a>.</em></strong> <em>Also Sheldon in Big Bang Theory says it so it must be true.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you've mentioned freezing helps a lot as it stops any mold full stop, you would have to thaw it but this can be done with a microwave in about 10 seconds or a toaster for a little bit longer (I'm not sure on the specific for that one but it isn't too long). You are correct in that the bread is slightly soggy once defrosted but if you are game for a toast sandwich then just leave it in the toaster to crisp up and it will give you a delicious crunchy sandwich!</p>

<p>If you fancy a change from white or 50/50 bread - try wholewheat bread, this takes a longer time to develop mold and bacteria (or at least it takes longer for you to notice it) and is also more healthy for you, but keep in mind you should still store the bread in a dark, dry place.</p>

<p>Is there any way to either <strong>stop the tickly sensation in one's nose which indicates you are about to sneeze, or to speed up a sneeze</strong> so I'm not sitting here for 5 minutes with the tickly sensation just waiting for it to come?</p>

<p>I've tried blowing my nose to remove anything that could be up there causing the irritation.</p>

<p>The reason I ask to speed up the sneeze is because once I have sneezed, the tickling sensation goes away for a while, so if the feeling cannot be removed, I wish for it to be over and done with.</p>
","<p>As @Mooseman said, pinching the nose can make the tickling go away. But you should not pinch it as if something smells bad (closing the nostrils), but instead only apply some pressure on both sides of the nose bridge with your fingers so that you still can (could, if you did not have a cold) breathe. You might try a bit to find the right spot, but you will definitely know it as soon as you did!</p>

<p>A trick to help sneezing is looking into bright light. Not too bright, of course because you don't want to damage your eyes. This works, because the nerves responsible for the sneezing reflex and the ones for noticing brightness may lay close together in some people. Therefore the brightness signal might ""jump over"" and intensify the sneezing stimulus which would then finally lead to a relieving sneeze...</p>

<p>The size of both the bandaid, and the cuts we make depend on the size of the injured finger. In addition, the way we cut also depends on the make of our standard bandaid. If it was a whole strip with wound pads to the outer sides we have to remove parts of the central wound pad, if the lateral plaster rim was wide enough and the wound bad small, we can just cut the sides of the trapeziod but leave the plaster to additional fix the bandaid.</p>

<p>You could also try burning the documents, just get a metal bucket or something non-flammable to put the bits of paper in and then take it outside and set it on fire - if you smoke it would make a nice outside heater during the winter but could be a bit of a hazard so is something to think about.</p>

<p>Another method: Soak them in water. This method may take a while however but you will be able to dispose of large quantities of documents in any one go - adding things like vinegar or salt to the warm water solution would help to speed up the process.</p>

<p>There are also independent paper disposal companies that you could look into if you want to pass the job off onto someone else. Your local area or city might do a document destruction day which you can hop along to and destroy all your documents for free but you would have research into this.</p>

"How to remove ball pen marks from the clothes?","52553","","<p>I got a lot of drawing from ball pens on my clothes. I tried washing them with soap, but that didn't help. How can I successfully remove ball pen marks from my clothes?</p>
","<p>First off, you need to determine what kind of ink stain you're dealing with.
Not all pens with a ball are actual ""ballpoint"" pens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Traditional <strong>ballpoint pens</strong> (like the ubiquitous Bic and Paper Mate) use a fast-drying, <strong>oil-based ink</strong> that requires a solvent to remove.<sup>1</sup> <strong>Rollerball pens</strong>, on the other hand, (common manufacturers include Uni-Ball and Pilot), use <strong>water-based inks</strong> that are fairly easy to remove, while <strong>gel pens</strong> use a <strong>highly-pigmented</strong> type of <strong>ink</strong> that can be a bit more difficult.<sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're certain it's an <strong>oil-based ink</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find a suitable solvent. Common isopropyl alcohol is suitable for most stain-removal jobs and can be purchased generically at a pharmacy, for example <em>rubbing alcohol</em>.</li>
<li>Place the stained garment on several layers of paper towels, so the ink has somewhere to go.</li>
<li>Apply your alcohol-based solvent of choice.</li>
<li>Wait 3-5 minutes. The solvent needs a few minutes to break down the oils in the ink.</li>
<li>Blot the stain using layers of white paper towels.</li>
<li>Repeat as needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>If it's <strong>water-based ink</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Soak the stained garment in (skim) milk.</li>
<li>Wait for at least half an hour.</li>
<li>Scrub the stain gently with a toothbrush, cuticle brush or similar soft-bristled brush.</li>
<li>Rinse thoroughly with warm water.</li>
</ol>

<p>And if it's <strong>highly-pigmented ink</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hand-wash with soap or regular detergent as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Rinse thoroughly with running water.</li>
<li>Try to blot any remaining ink by pressing the fabric between two absorbent cloths, or stacks of napkins or paper towels.

<hr></li>
<li>Dissolve 1 teaspoon of ammonia in warm water.</li>
<li>Soak the garment in the ammonia solution for one hour.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 and scrub with a soft brush, if needed.

<ul>
<li>If the stain is responding to this treatment, repeat as needed until the ink is gone, and launder as usual.

<hr></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mix 1 cup of rubbing alcohol with 1 cup of vinegar.</li>
<li>Place the garment on a clean, dry towel and apply the solution.</li>
<li>Let it soak for at least 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Pour a small amount of table salt over the stain.</li>
<li>Wait 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Scrub with a soft brush and rinse with hot water.

<ul>
<li>If the stain is responding to this treatment, repeat as needed until the ink is gone, and launder as usual.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>You may have to experiment with the above steps (hence the horizontal lines) or try other methods. Just make sure to rinse the garment very thoroughly between different methods to avoid mixing chemicals.</p>

"How do I dry out the inside of my car?","49678","","<p>The weather this morning was hot and dry, without a cloud in the sky. We have an uncovered parking lot at work, so I opened the windows an inch or two (2.54 cm to 5.08 cm for the more metrically inclined) to let some air in and keep the interior of the car from getting too hot for my drive home.</p>

<p>Then it rained for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>I really hate having long fingernails. Especially when camping, they're harder to keep clean, so I don't like to bite them.</p>

"How do you stop headphone wires from breaking?","48147","","<p>Headphones rarely last more than a few years before the wires snap due to the constant movement they have to endure. Is there a way to stop me having to get out the soldering iron, or worse, buy a new pair?</p>
","<p>I use cheapish Sony earbuds - great sound, but they tend to break every couple of years because the soldering inside the earbuds is pretty shoddy. Here's a quick summary of all the advice I've found on keeping headphones safe; most of it is pretty obvious, but sadly I tend to ignore it because HARD WORK IS HARD. </p>

<ul>
<li>Unplug the jack from your player when you're not using it. If you have small earbuds, don't wrap the cable around the player and stuff it in the case or in your pocket, as this puts strain on the jack and may even damage your player at the socket end.</li>
<li>Get a headphone case that lets you wind your cables around something. (<a href=""http://mashable.com/2011/02/26/headphone-cable-management/"">Here's a list of ideas, some better than others</a>). Don't want to buy one? Take a stiff piece of card and cut two notches in it, one for the jack and one for the earbud/headphone connection. </li>
<li>Avoid huge flapping lengths of cable - it'll get caught on things and be painful, embarrassing, and eventually expensive. Pass the cable through your shirt, or under your coat or scarf. </li>
<li>For the same reason, always secure your player: either clip the case to your belt, trousers, etc, or zip the pocket tight. </li>
<li>Unplug headphones by pulling on the jack rather than the cable itself.</li>
<li>Do not sleep on, sit on, fling, or absent-mindedly nibble headphones.</li>
<li>Don't follow my example and get headphones with good quality soldering.</li>
<li>...Or just throw in the towel and go wireless. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> most failures occur at the jack end or at the connection with the earpiece. Protect these parts from tugs and strain and you protect your headphones. (And I imagine mid-cable breaks will be less likely as well.)</p>

"How to stop leather from making stain on clothes with light colors","47605","","<p>Some clothes or accessories made from leather tend to create (dark) stain or spots on clothes, of course especially on clothes having light colors. Some spots can be removed  easily, others not.</p>

<p>Examples: Wearing leather shoes or a leather belt with light trousers, using a bag made from leather, wearing gloves and a white shirt, wearing a leather jacket.</p>

<p>Of course, this all depends on the leather used and the type of cloth or accessory, and the color and material of the clothes becoming stain etc. Especially, I noticed that this happens with different kinds of leather, but not with all products made from leather.</p>

<p>There are a number of workarounds such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't wear clothes with light colors.</li>
<li>Don't use shoes, belts, bags etc. made from leather.</li>
<li>Use the cloth or accessory made from leather 10 years or longer and hope that after such a long time it will have stopped making stain or spots.</li>
</ul>

<p>But what can be done to stop something made from leather from creating stain or spots?</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Using other acids like lemon juice, etc I do not know if work, but they should. Mixing the acid with baking soda should make a sort of scouring powder if you are trouble removing the stain with just the acid.</em> </li>

<li><p><em>Wearing a light weight  garment over the leather, and in a way to protect the other clothing may work if none of the other methods work.</em> </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stains can also be avoided by knowing the composition of the stain:</strong></p>

<p>Do not use sharp knives including razor knife. It will cut the hairs and make it difficult. But if the hairs are very stubborn and likely to tangled like a closed loop, cut the hairs with small manicure scissors or razor blade to break the closed loop. </p>

<p>If you are not satisfied after trying the mentioned workarounds, then I would recommend you to get a screw driver and remove the caster from the chair, then wash on the soap water and apply lubricants. </p>

<p>Does anyone know how to remove it? </p>
","<p>If you're looking for a lifehack v. a dedicated product, I would go down this road:</p>

<p>Temperature will be key. If the sap is still in a rather large clump, ice works great. The sap will contract at a different rate than the glass, and usually dislodge in a rather large piece.</p>

<p>If it has smeared (I suspect it has), you will need to get it warm. Maybe a piece of black paper underneath the affected area and leave it in the sun, possible steam, or other sources of heat that won't damage your glass (no blowtorches). Paper towels will help quite a bit if you can get it hot enough. For any remaining residue, dissolving it in copious amounts of alcohol(ethanol is best) is the only sure-fire way I'm aware of.</p>

"Is there a way to erase pencil without a standard eraser?","41343","","<p>There are times when I am away from home with my sketchpad and I realize I do not have my eraser with me. <strong>Are there any quick tricks to erase pencil marks on a paper without ruining the paper, or smearing the other pencil marks?</strong> </p>

I have tried dried chewing gum I was done with, but that too just seemed to smudge the pencil mark. On one occasion I tried silly putty and though it worked o.k., there were still faint lines and it wasn't erased completely.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lLBwQ.jpg"" alt=""jars""></p>

<p><strong>ATTEMPT</strong>: I have tried twisting as hard as I can, but clearly that hasn't worked so far. I have also tried twisting with a shirt to improve my grip. And I've tried using a knife to loosen the lid, but that also rarely helps.</p>
","<p>Usually jars with stiff lids are fresh from the store and have been packed with the contents under lower pressure than the outside air i.e a vacuum.  This pressure difference can increase the resistance presented by the thread and can make opening a jar for the first time difficult.</p>

<p>This approach that can be taken if a little damage to the lid is acceptable and requires only tools that are readily available in most kitchens.</p>

<ol>
<li>Take a small tool like a butter knife or spoon.</li>
<li>Tilt the jar so that the seam between the jar and the lid is accessible.</li>
<li>Insert the tip of the tool into the seam.</li>
<li>Gently leaver the tool until it lifts the lid back from the jar, breaking the seal and allowing the pressure to equalize.</li>
<li>Now that the seal has been released it should be easy to twist the lid off normally.</li>
</ol>

<p>With a little practice and a light touch it is possible to release the seal without permanently changing the shape of the lid.  I am happy enough keeping any food remaining in these jars if refrigerated but would avoid reusing the jar for projects with sterile requirements like making jam or preserves.</p>

When I go to the forest or somewhere in the nature and need to make fire it is very difficult to burn these wet branches. I usually carry a cigarette lighter and some cardboard or newspaper to start fire, but when the wood is wet the paper burns fast and the wood still can't catch fire. </p>

<p>What can I do to start fire during the wet days? <strong>I don't want to use flammable liquids</strong> like gasoline or BBQ liquid as they can be sometimes dangerous or can spill in my backpack.</p>
","<p>Water usually only penetrates the outer layers of dead wood, so your best bet is to use a knife or hatchet to strip away the damp outer layer.</p>

<ol>
<li>Gather some kindling, dead wood that is about as wide as your finger or less.
<ul>
<li>Pine will usually make a great fire starter, the <a href=""http://youtu.be/ldAKAm-2B6E?t=2m12s"">sap/resin is flammable</a> after it is heated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use a sharp knife/hatchet to strip away as much bark and wet wood as possible.</li>
<li>If you can use a hatchet to split larger pieces of wood into kindling, this will expose the drier inner layers.</li>
<li>Start a small fire using the stripped kindling.</li>
<li>Use the small fire to heat and dry the larger pieces. It will put off a lot of steam/smoke, but the smoke should subside after a few minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>It will take a bit more time and effort to get it going, but once you have a nice bed of coals established you should be able to keep the fire going even if it starts to rain again.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is probably worth mentioning that there are some solid fire-starters that can be safely carried in your pack.</p>

<ol>
<li>Magnesium Bars.
<ul>
<li>Use a knife to shave off a little pile of magnesium and you can start it with a spark. Magnesium burns at a pretty impressive temperature, but it doesn't help too much with damp wood because it tends to burn pretty fast.</li>

"How to boil an egg using an electric kettle without a mess?","34752","","<p>Boiling eggs in kettle is fast and convenient way, especially if you don't have access to some pot (e.g. hotel room). But usually what happens, if one of eggs is weak and break, you're ending up with a big mess (egg sticked to kettle walls) spending more times on cleaning than normally you would boil them in the pot.</p>

<p>So what's the safe method of boil an egg using an electric kettle to avoid messy surprises?</p>
","<p>I saw a method on <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-hard-boil-an-egg-using-an-electric-kettle/"" rel=""nofollow"">instructables</a> that involved tilting the kettle to help the eggs avoid hitting the heating element which would cause a nasty mess - however I don't think that one is a good solution as it could vastly depend on what kettle you are using.  I've given the link up top just in case anyone is interested in this method and would like to give it a go but it go me thinking about another idea which would allow the eggs to avoid the heating element at the bottom no matter the position / size.</p>

<p>What you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>One (or more) egg(s)</li>
<li>One electric kettle</li>
<li>One tangerine / satsuma / clementine / orange netting (or any other netting that would be a suitable substitute.</li>
<li>A piece of string or a small stick (a couple of strands of spaghetti might do the trick)  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now the idea here is we are going to put the egg into the netting and try and suspend it from the top of the kettle, allowing it to bathe in the boiling water while staying clear of the elements at the bottom of the kettle.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>The string method</em></strong> I would wrap the egg up like a Hershey's Kiss and tie the string around the top of the netting and then tie it to the handle (better if the handle is over the top of the kettle) or even just get it to the right height and shut the lid and the egg netting should remain suspended in there until you think it is time to release it.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>The spaghetti / stick method</em></strong> would involve leaving the lid open, it will be kind of like making a hammock for the egg. Push the spaghetti though one side of the netting (probably need to bunch up the ends a little) and then placing the egg in the middle of the netting allowing it to rest there (much like a hammock) and you can place the spaghetti across the open kettle allowing the 'hammock' to be suspended in the water and once again, avoid the heating element at the bottom.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that using spaghetti may not in practice work. This is because the steam coming from the kettle might cook the spaghetti and make it weak and saggy which is why something else thin and stick like may work in place, or use many spaghetti strands to delay the cooking time.</p>

<p>Something else that I have just thought of after looking around my desk is you could use a mesh pencil pot of something similar to act as a cage which would protect the eggs from the kettle's elements but may present a hazard of itself as it might shake around a lot which could crack the egg. Just a thought.</p>

","<p>According to this article titled <a href=""http://ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Get-Rid-of-Trash-Can-Smell&amp;id=1245874"" rel=""nofollow"">""how to get rid of trash can smell""</a> it is not an easy task. </p>

<p>Recommended to get rid of the odour listed in order of effectiveness</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cleaning up the trash can with soap and water, using a hose outside,
leaving the can in the sun to dry. Sunshine will kill the
microorganisms that cause that trashy smell.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Charcoal The article suggests some chunks of charcoal in a small area will absorb the smell. </p></li>
<li><p>Baking soda also a good absorbent of smell in a small area.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The article gives some suggestions for masking the scent at the source, which might be answers to the OP request for something quick and EZ.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trash Can Smell Masking</p>
  
  <p>If you can't beat them, hide them; that's the whole idea behind
  perfumes and some such products, isn't it? The methods below basically
  mask the smell with another more powerful odor rather than remove the
  smell, so you should be sure you are going to be happy with the
  result.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Vanilla Essence: Pour several drops of vanilla essence on a couple of cotton wools. Toss the cotton wools inside the confined spaces
  nearest your trash can. Leave them for several days and you will
  notice that the area smells nice, or at least smells nicer.</p></li>
  <li><p>Lemon or Lime Peels: Just put some lemon or lime peels into an uncovered container and leave them inside the confined area for a
  couple of days. The citrus smell will naturally replace the bad trash
  can smell.</p></li>
  <li><p>Mint Extract: If you favor neither the smell of citrus nor vanilla, you can perhaps use mint extract instead. Pour several drops of mint
  extract on a couple of cotton wools. Toss the cotton wools inside the
  confined space and leave them for a couple of days.</p></li>
  <li><p>Coffee: Ground coffee has a nice, crisp natural aroma. Just put about a cup of ground coffee in a flat, uncovered container. Place the
  container inside the confined space for several days. If the bad smell
  is extremely horrible, put more ground coffee. The area will smell of
  fresh coffee for many days.</p></li>
  <li><p>Tea: If you don't like coffee, you can use tea bags instead. Just place 2-3 tea bags inside the confined space. The tea leaves in the
  bags will not only absorb the trash can smell but will also release
  the natural aroma of tea.</p></li>
  <li><p>Orange peels: Get an orange and poke it with a sharp object like a needle or fork to form small holes. Place each of the cloves inside
  these small holes until most of the orange surfaces are covered. It
  may look like a hedgehog with the cloves jutting out of the orange
  fruit. Leave it in the confined area for a couple of days. The area
  will smell nice with the said combinations.</p></li>
  <li><p>Pandan Leaf: It is easy to get pandan leaf in tropical countries as it is widely used in Southeast Asian cooking to add aroma to dishes.
  Its pleasant aroma also acts as natural air freshener. Just take a few
  strips of the pandan leaves and tie them into knots. Place the leaves
  inside the confined space and leave them until the leaves are withered
  or dried up. Replace the leaves regularly until the trash can smell
  goes away.</p></li>

"How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?","30359","","<p>We've all had the problem, you need that one dress shirt you own, but it is full of creases because you stuffed it all the way in the back of your closet. No way i am going to iron them, it takes way too much time and effort!</p>

<p>I am looking for a way to get creases out of mostly dress shirts, without actually ironing it.</p>
","<p>How much time do you have? I can save you a lot of <em>effort</em>...</p>

<ul>
<li>Take your shirt and thoroughly wet it in the sink/tub.</li>
<li>Wring/squeeze all the water out of it that you can.</li>
<li>Toss it in the dryer with a (clean, dry) towel or two.</li>
<li>Dry for 10-20 minutes, depending on material.</li>
<li>Put your shirt on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just throwing it in the dryer works <em>somewhat</em>, but wetting it down works better. Unfortunately, this makes it take a while to dry. Adding a couple towels to the load will help draw the moisture out faster. I think that's due to having more dry surface area to wick water into, along with helping the tumble action (a single shirt doesn't tumble as well). Whether that's the reason or not, it significantly speeds up drying time for (very) small loads.</p>

<p>I've done this a few times. With lightweight dress shirts, it's very quick. For heavier winter-weight shirts, it may take a little longer, but it's much easier than ironing. This especially helps if you're running late and need to shower or do other things, since you can do those <em>while</em> it's drying.</p>

<p>This obviously won't put nice ironing creases <em>into</em> your shirt, but it will get rid of unwanted wrinkles.</p>

<li>Leaving playback control buttons on the speaker accessible (by being able to press them through a transparent or perhaps even opaque layer?);</li>
</ul>
","<p>I've found that the best option to bring any technology in the shower is to use a Ziploc bag. I prefer bigger ones, but sometimes small ones can work. You should squeeze all of the air out of the bag; you can do this by physically squeezing it with your hands or by sucking out the air with your mouth. Ziploc bags are transparent, so you will be able to see the buttons and they will be easier to touch because the bag is airtight. </p>

<p>It's also worth noting that Ziploc's, and sandwich bags generally, are weaker around the edges. So, it's always a good idea to double-bag (with the zipper of the outer bag closing over the bottom of the inner bag) to ensure that, should the side of one break, no water gets onto the device.</p>

<p>Additionally, making sure there's a bit of air in the inner bag (so it's a bit puffy) is a good idea for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It lets you know if the inner baggie isn't airtight / watertight.</li>
<li>It allows you to effectively use the touchscreen (on touchscreen devices, otherwise it can be very difficult to tap and swipe effectively), and</li>
<li>It's less likely to muffle the speaker.</li>

"How can I reduce the chlorine smell on my skin after swimming?","28155","","<p>I swim laps in a  chlorinated pool, and even after a soapy shower, I have a slight chlorine smell on my skin for the next day.   I've tried lathering up extra and leaving the lather on my skin for a short time before rinsing, but the smell persists.</p>

<p>I'm not interested in solutions that mask the chlorine smell with another -- first because that's my preference, but also because my wife has sensitivities to many perfumes used in soaps.</p>
","<p>Chlorine smell is due to the chlorine and chloramines layered on the skin after using the pool. So removing the chlorine and chloramines contents are the solution to remove this smell. As soon as you exit from the pool, stand in the hot shower with the max temperature you can for at least 2-3 mins. Then lather with your regular natural soap for some time, allow to dry and then wash thoroughly with hot shower. This removes the maximum chlorine on your skin and then you can try out the following methods.</p>

<p><strong>1. Mild acid solution:</strong> This will not harm the skin. Either you can use citric acid or acetic acid. (a) Squeeze and dilute the lemon (1:4 with water) or orange (1:2 with water) and apply on your body for some time and leave it to dry. This acid will eat away the chlorine. (b) Use white vinegar for acetic acid and dilute with water, say 1:5, and apply on your body and wait for some 2-3 mins. Then take a hot shower.</p>

<p><strong>2. Vitamin C</strong> removes chlorine. Ascorbic acid in the vitamin C gets away the chlorine smell. You can buy vitamin C crystals from shops. Dilute with water, apply on your body, wait for some time, say 2-3, then rinse with hot water. There are vitamin C creams available on markets, same procedure after applying. These two products are not so costly.</p>

<p><strong>3. Minimize chlorine exposure:</strong> (a) Apply oil before entering the pool. Olive oil or coconut oil can help better. This forms a protective layer. Rinse with hot water on exit from the pool. (b) Beeswax or butter are also the other options for this method.</p>

<p><strong>4. Club soda</strong> also helps. Rinse the body with club soda and then take a hot shower. 
Technically speaking, chlorine oxidizes on skin. It chemically reacts with the surface of the skin and forms a layer of chloramines with hydrogen. Mono chloramines are more stable and do not dissipate as rapidly as free chlorine. Any antioxidant will help to release chlorine's bond to the skin. Then the chlorine easily washes away. Applying any fruits with more antioxidant will help to remove the skin. Then take a hot shower.</p>

<p>I have plenty of methods to open the lock after it is frozen. I have used graphite powder to free up the lock and I have heated the key and inserted it to melt the ice.</p>

<p>I am looking for a solution to prevent the lock from becoming frozen in the first place. I have tried keeping it lubricated with graphite powder before the winter storm and also opening the door more frequently during the storm in order to not have it freeze from going unused. All of these failed to prevent the lock from freezing.</p>

<p>How can I prevent my lock from freezing during a winter storm?</p>
","<p>There is a couple tried and true methods used of varying difficult from living in AK and ND.</p>

<p>1) Install a storm door. This will provide other additional benefits as well. Should have no frozen up key lock issues after that. $80 to hundreds of dollars, much easy to install yourself than a framed door.</p>

<p>2) Go to a keyless lock. $60 to hundreds. Just keep in mind they use batteries.</p>

<p>3) Use a rubber fruit preservation cover for the door knob to cover the lock. They sell them at the grocery store and online but you need one door knob size but that will also slip on and not come off and last. $5-15, May not work for all doors / knobs. Some lock smith shops also sell one designed for locks. If you are handy you could also make your own using the tool coating rubber they sell at hardware stores (but don't build it on the knob!!!!!).</p>

<p>4) Modify a winter outdoors spicket / water faucet cover to place over door knob.. This does though usually involve adding a sticky hook to the door so the covers nylon or rubber cord can attach to something. I recommend the plastic coated ones, not just the foam ones. $3-$6 </p>

<p>5) 1/4,qt Ziplock Freezer Bag and a thick rubber or nylon cord that locks like the baby cabinet lock ones. You will have to replace the bag regularly. 

<p>6) For a frozen lock I use mini zippo lighter fluid containers as the tip works well for inserting into lock and it's nearly instant. Otherwise I use the containers refilled with isopropyl alcohol, but it's not quite as fast. (See note below)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other Notes: WD-40 , as recommended by others isn't a as reliable I personally find for frozen situations. Those lock deicers are just isopropyl alcohol ( $1 for 12oz vs $3 for 1 oz ) in a nice dispenser. I would not heat a key up, you weaken it and if it has a chip you could damage or destroy it. Duct tape or other gummed adhesive may clog the lock creating bigger issues, it tends to also be brittle at colder temperatures and not stay on. </p>

The health benefits that come from masturbation are <a href=""https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexuality/masturbation"" rel=""nofollow"">extensive</a>.</p>

<p>For many men and women, dildos greatly help with masturbation. However, they carry an unwarranted negative stigma and are illegal in many parts of the world. These points can severely hinder effective masturbation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some counties look the other way when they're labeled as stress-relief tools, but there is still the risk due to many obscenity laws. Far too many ban them outright. </p></li>
<li><p>Negative stigma for a range of reasons such as religious intolerance, societal pressure, and lack of education.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost may also be a factor. In regions where dildos are accessible, they may not always be cheap. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, it's common knowledge that household objects are sometimes used to achieve the same goal, however there are also plenty of mishaps that can end either embarrassingly or dangerously. With the stigma, unavailability, cost, and safety in mind:</p>

<p><strong>What would be an ideal, safe, household object that could serve as a replacement for a standard dildo?</strong></p>

<p>The answer should preferably be cleanable and reusable, but this isn't a strict requirement. </p>
","<p>Before answering this, I think it should be known that <strong>nothing</strong> is a full-proof safe alternative to a dildo. You should also know that anything other specifically a sex toy <em>comes with inherent risk</em>.</p>

<p>Next, let's clear something up. Anal matters greatly more than vaginal. The reason is because it is much easier to lodge or even <em>lose</em> an object in your anus. Your vagina is a canal:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z0VxT.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z0VxT.png"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>Things won't get lost up there, but that's <em>not</em> to say you want to let full objects become engulfed (they would need to be small, your vagina isn't very deep, but it's possible).</p>

<p><strong>You asked for an ideal safe household object (under the circumstances). This is my recommendation for the anus <em>and</em> vagina:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hA2wq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hA2wq.jpg"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>There are no chances this will be lost in the anus, because the top is stopping it. Depending on the type of hairbrush, some handles may be better than others (less rigid, etc).</p>

<p>Remember, as I said in the beginning, nothing is fully safe. An example of something that could go wrong with a hairbrush would be a cracked plastic handle. That could be dangerous, clearly. Check the item yourself first!</p>

<p>Remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>Never use glass bottles (this should be obvious)</li>
<li>Never use anything that you can't get a good hold onto</li>
<li>Don't use anything wood, you wouldn't want it to splint during use. This includes wooden hairbrushes.</li>

"How to get sock marks off legs quickly","26027","","<p>I have to wear boots with socks all day for work and then when I want to go out at night and wear a skirt with bare legs, I have lines from my socks around my ankles.  Has anyone found a way of making them fade faster?</p>
","<p>No hacky answer here I'm afraid - I know from experience (having the same trouble) that there isn't a way of removing those marks other than waiting for the body to do it naturally - depending how old you are, that can take a couple or three hours or overnight. What you could do, though, is buy different socks with a longer, slouchy top to allow for expansion, so when your legs swell as the day goes on, no marks from tight socks are showing. Alternatively, wear light or medium support tights beneath the trousers and put the socks on over the top on days when you know you'll be wanting to wear a dress or skirt later. Check, though, that the socks you're wearing aren't simply really tight at the top anyway - some are tighter than others.</p>

<p>I did resort to cutting through the top band with a pair of scissors on tighter pairs, angling the cut towards the foot of the sock - but the sock then tends to disappear downwards, bunching up under your foot as the day goes on if you're wearing boots, not always, but often.</p>

  <p><strong>Any tips or tricks on how to charge my phone any quicker?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't want to have to mess around with the charger or the phone (iPhone if that is needed for the answer) so please avoid these answers!</p>
","<p>There are numerous things you need to know about charging your phone in order to charge it any faster.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ampere is unit of current intensity. So higher amperage means <em>more energy</em> in the same time. <sub>It does <strong>not</strong> damage the battery if you charge with lower (<a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/4325/how-can-i-charge-my-smartphone-quicker/#comment6482_4335"">or higher</a>) amperage than recommended by the wall adapter, if it's lower it simply charges slower.</sub>

<ol>
<li>USB 2.0 has a maximum of 0.5 ampere</li>
<li>USB 3.0 has a maximum of 0.9 ampere (only when transmitting data at SuperSpeed rates) or 1.5 ampere</li>
<li>a wall outlet definitely has enough ampere for all current types of smartphones or tablets, so it's down to the wall adapter</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>So check the wall adapter that came with your phone so you know which power source is fast enough for maximum charging speed. It should state how much ampere (SI unit symbol: <code>A</code>, often shortened to <em>amps</em>) the output got. Most common smartphones ""need"" (for fastest charging) 1.0 ampere, newer smartphones ""need"" 1.5 ampere and tablets even ""need"" 2.0 ampere.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Turning your smartphone completely off increases charging speed to a maximum.</p>

<ol>
<li>as an alternative you can:

<ul>
<li>use flight mode (already increases speed significantly)</li>
<li>turn off wireless connections manually (Wi-Fi, mobile data connection, GPS, etc.)</li>
<li>limit mobile data connection to GSM</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>(these tips are also handy if you simply want to make your battery last longer)</p></li>
<li>closing apps reduces power consumption as well</li>
</ol>

<p>If your smartphone drains the battery faster than before it could be a sign of the battery itself dying. This just happens; batteries have a limited lifetime but discussing how to increase battery life is a different topic.</p>

<p>Cut it with sissors. Fold it and stich a hem on to stop it unraveling. Not too hard with a hand needle, but if you have a sewing machine, use it.</p>

<h3>Nilon:</h3>

<p>Cut and seal it like a rope.
Heat up a old butter knife til it is red hot. Cut it, melting the ends shut. Dip fingers in water and mold it to a rounded edge. Or/And use a nail file to round it after it has cooled.</p>

<h3>Metal Tips</h3>

<p>If it has  metal top on the end.
Then you will need to examine how it is attached.
The ones on cloth belts can normally be opened up prior to cutting and folded back over after you have cut.</p>

"Removing soot and smoke smell after a house fire","19868","","<p>Due to a recent house fire caused by a forgotten chip-pan, we now have all the rooms of our house left sooty and smelling of smoke.</p>

<p>Luckily the fire department arrived within 2 minutes and had the fire out just as quickly, preserving all other rooms from fire damage.</p>

<p>How can we quickly and easily get rid of the smell which is now in every other room?</p>

<ul>
<li>We have had all windows and doors open for 24 hours so far</li>
<li>We have wiped all surface, but they are left mostly gray</li>
<li>We have got rid of all materials such as clothing which havve been damaged</li>
</ul>
","<p>Seeing that there was no response to this question I did a google search for <a href=""//google.com/search?q=remove+smell+after+house+fire"">remove smell after house fire</a> which lists some alternatives as to how to handle the smell after a fire. However none of the solutions seems to be quick and easy, or does guarantee anything.</p>

<p>A summary of what to do related to different areas affected by smoke are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Ventilate as much as possible</em> &mdash; If available use extra fans to build a little overpressure and circulate the air throughout the house
</p></li>
<li><p><em>Wash walls, surfaces, cupboards, ...</em> &mdash; using either vinegar solutions, normal detergents, dish soap, or even careful usage of <a href=""http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/989097"">trisodium phosphate</a></p></li>
<li><em>Leave stuff to pick up the odour</em> &mdash; <a href=""http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf43427903.tip.html"">plain charcoal</a>, bowls of vinegar, coffe powder, (heavy) incense</li>
<li><em>Baking soda and vacuum</em> &mdash; For carpets and furniture, <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/how_5108427_naturally-smoke-smells-after-fire.html"">sprinkle baking soda on them, leave overnight and vacuum</a> (preferably with a vacuum with HEPA filter)</li>
<li><em>Wash clothes</em> &mdash; possibly repeat washing cycle (before drying clothes) with combinations of detergents, vinegar and washing soda</li>

"Sleeping in a noisy environment","19766","","<p>I recently moved into a shared house with 3 other roommates (4 if you count the couple as 2 people) on the main floor. It's also close to a busy street. At night the noise sometimes disturbs me. Sources of noise:</p>

<ol>
<li>cars and trucks going by</li>
<li>music from roommates (especially with loud base)</li>
<li>roommates opening and closing doors</li>
<li>people using the bathroom (my bedroom is right beside it)</li>
</ol>

<p>Things I've tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>closing window</li>
<li>ear plugs (I find they fall out while I sleep) </li>
<li>turning on air purifier (makes noise similar to fan)</li>
<li>app on my phone for white noise</li>
<li>going to bed earlier</li>
</ol>

<p>My roommates have approximately the same schedule, but one ends work at midnight. There's only one who plays music with speakers and I should probably talk to him about it but I don't want to upset him when I just moved in. Even on the lowest volume, trance music is still very difficult to sleep with. </p>

<p>EDIT: I'm open to suggestions for sources of white noise, for example I've been using an app on my phone but I find that the sound has too much variation and that I prefer very constant sound e.g. if it's rain noises it disturbs me if every 30 or 60 seconds they throw in thunder.</p>

<p>UPDATE: thankfully I moved out of this place.</p>
","<p>I found standard cylindrical earplugs are prone to falling out because they are too long: they protrude from the ear, so every time you move your head on the pillow, the earplugs are pushed sideways.<br>
I solved this by cutting them in half, making 2 short cylinders.  </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: this works well in my case. If you roll up the earplug and insert it completely into the ear canal, it may be fiddly to remove (although tweezers should be sufficient).  </p>

<p>My ear canals are on the small side, so I can't insert a rolled-up earplug.<br>
Instead, I wedge a cut-in-half earplug into the opening of the ear canal. This creates a good seal without the need to roll up the earplug, and it leaves the tip of the earplug sticking out far enough to easily remove it. </p>

I usually run my finger around the entire tube looking for it, until I eventually find it. This usually takes 20-30 minutes. There must be an better alternative. <strong>What is an easy way to quickly find a hole in a tire tube?</strong> </p>

"How to ""recharge"" sodium acetate hand warmer without a stove?","18381","","<p>I have a pretty standard hand warmer with the metal discs in them to activate them - I did some research and found out that they are Sodium Acetate hand warmers and the disc is used to 'freeze' the liquid making it heat up.  </p>

<p>I used this on the way to work as I was getting a little chilly and now that I am at work I want to 'recharge' it, i.e. make it back into liquid form, and the instructions given for doing this is to put the pack in a pan filled with boiling water and then allow it to simmer for 10 minutes and it should be returned to it's original state.<br>
However, as mentioned, I am at work and unfortunately we do not have a stove for me to keep a pan simmering for 10 minutes but I do have a microwave and a kettle and other standard kitchen utensils. So my question is, is there a lifehack / way to 'recharge' / reset a sodium acetate hand warmer without having a stove to keep water simmering for 10 minutes? But instead just using standard utensils or a kettle or a microwave?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It does say on the pack not to microwave or put it in a kettle but if there are any lifehacks contrary to these warnings, I am not afraid to be a bit of a 'Daring Dan' and break the rules because sometimes I just want the world to descend into anarchy.</p>
","<p>I think the kettle advice is just so it doesn't get into contact with the heating coil. </p>

<p>I have a kettle that has a covered coil and it works fine with those, but you have to keep it in there for a while (it still needs a few minutes to completely dissolve, there is no instant solution). </p>

<p>Due to inequal heating in most microwaves I would not recommend this, but I don't see anything that should inherently make it not work, other than the piece of metal in it making it somewhat dangerous.</p>

<p>If you are that daring dan type and have one of those handwarmers that you don't need, along with a microwave that you don't need I would give it a try and do it on low power settings. The worst that can possibly happen is it popping open and covering your microwave in sodium acetate.</p>

My problem is that my glass lens keep falling off on multiple occasions. I can't find out how to keep them in. When they fall out, I have trouble getting them back in properly. This problem seems to present itself whenever I go from extremely cold to extremely warm, etc. The methods I have tried to keep my lenses in are:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tape: This is really stupid and can leave a film on your glasses.</p></li>
<li><p>Glue: This worked, but I got glue on my lens, and if I want to take my glasses back to the store and have insurance fix them, they wouldn't like the glue, even if I was careful. And glue is hard to get off plastic lens.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking them to the store. This works, but unless you plan on driving me to the store every time this problem presents, this is not viable. Because it occurs a lot.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is there any other method of keeping my lens in other than these?</em></p>

<p><strong>Things I want:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>No gluey products, tape included.</p></li>
<li><p>I want something cheap, but a expensive really cool product or something that cost a bit that I didn't think of would not go amiss.</p></li>
<li><p>A contraption that I can make would be OK. I am really good with my hands and can sew,woodwork, etc. Don't discount my abilities when offering suggestions, but methods that include expensive machinery can be suggested but will probably not be viable.</p></li>
<li><p>A product for both glass and plastic lens and for plastic and wire frames would be necessary. But if you found a method that fits only one or 2 of these criteria then that's OK to, I will consider.</p></li>
<li><p>Anything bulky or obviously weird would be a obvious no. But if it is true ingenuity and not some joke, then I will accept. I am  not excluding the weird.</p></li>
<li><p>Something that doesn't damage my lenses. I have a lot of trouble seeing as it, anything that contributes to that issue is a no. And obstruction of vision would have to be a no or minimal.</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>The reason (as you most likely know) is that the glass and the frame warm and cool at different speeds thus expanding / retracting unevenly.</p>

<p>To prevent this from happening take the glasses off when entering a warm room and hold them in your hands for a moment. You should be able to warm them sufficiently and evenly so nothing is going to happen. But this of course takes thought and a minute or so. Its only viable in narrow situations.</p>

<p><strong>Quick solution</strong> if it just happened:</p>

<p>Rip some (small!) pieces of a paper-hanky and put them into the frame before placing the glass inside, the extra pressure should keep in in place for the moment. But keep in mind that this will (over time) bend your frame, so you might not want to apply this permanently.</p>

<p><strong>Lasting solution</strong> that takes time to construct: (I did not try this on wireframes, but on regular frames it works)</p>

<p>You need to add something to stabilize the glass until the temperature has evened out. You write you don't want to glue stuff on your glass, this solution uses glue (or solder if you happen to have a metal frame) to the frame and should not modify the glass at all.</p>

<p>Get some thin but sturdy metal piece (like from a paper clip) and cut in into a short pieces (I used ~5 mm but that depends on your frame). Bend it around the frame so that it sticks into the glass area for about 1 mm. Less may be sufficient but it again depends on your glasses. Now glue (or solder) it in place on the frame. You should use two of them on the lower right and lower left area of the frame (corners if available). That way your glasses can't fall out while the temperature is evening out.</p>

<p>If you use thick cable or one with a prominent color this will look either very cool or very stupid, so you might want to use a color that matches your frame. If done correctly it is not visible except when searched for with high attention.</p>

<p>It does not give perfect results though, if you switch temperatures and shake your head intensely your glasses could still fall out. If thats a problem apply a third wire on the center top (or one on each upper corners), but thats easier to spot.</p>

<p>In case you are capable of producing fine craft this solution can greatly add to the look of your glasses, up to the point of making them a unique piece of art. But I would not be able to do so and thus can't give guidance on it. Ask your local goldsmith.</p>

"How to strip coating off of wires without a wire stripper","15657","","<p>I am getting into robotics, and when I was building something, there were a bunch of wires that were too thin to get stripped by my wire stripper. I also tried sanding down the wire with sandpaper and stripping it with a Swiss Army Knife. The sandpaper took much longer than I would've liked and using the knife was very hard and also made the wire smaller and smaller each time I messed up or pressed too hard.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any hacks for stripping very thin wires when the wire stripper is too big?</strong></p>
","<p>Another option I didn't say is simply to pinch the wire between the thumbnail and index finger and pull. The insulation will tear and will not damage the wire inside. Sometimes it helps to chafe the insulation a bit with the thumbnail before pulling. Be careful where the wire is being pulled from. It should be held by pinching with the other hand.</p>

<hr>

<p>I never use a wire stripper, but dikes or wire cutters. The dikes must be very sharp. I don't use my dikes for anything except cutting wire, and I don't loan them, which keeps them in good shape.</p>

<p>Squeeze the wire slightly with the dikes at the point where the insulation should separate, then pull. The insulation will separate and slide off the end of the wire. The intent is for the dikes to cut through the insulation but not the wire, score the insulation, and allow it to tear the rest of the way off.</p>

<p>More care must be used with thinner wire. If stripping very thin wire, use fingernail clippers following the same procedure. However, nail clippers will not offer a ""feel"" and with them it's easy to cut too deep, cutting the wire. Clippers do offer precise control, however. With practice they work well.</p>

<p>Try not to score the wire when stripping. With multi-strand wire it's easy to cut some of the strands but leave others. Make a decision whether the wire is too damaged, needing to be redone. If being soldered, solder will flow up the wire a bit if done properly, strengthening it.</p>

<p>What I would do in your situation is make a custom wire stripper using fingernail clippers by placing a piece of metal between the cutting surfaces, preventing them from coming together completely. You can then reach into small spaces, squeeze, and pull off insulation easily.</p>

<p>Another method that works well is to roll the wire on a knife blade with your thumb, cutting the insulation completely around the wire, then slide off. For small wires this works well. It's not necessary to completely cut through the insulation, but score it all the way around. Doing this much will leave superficial cuts in your thumb, but it works well providing good control.</p>

"Is there any way to fill in a hole in my shoe - so it is waterproof?","14602","","<p>I usually buy new shoes every two years or so (mostly Nikes). When walking I seem to not lift my feet high enough and because of this I get a hole the size of a cent at the rear of the sole (under my foot pad).</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there is an easy solution to keep my feet dry when it rains. Either seal up the hole from the bottom or from the inside of the shoe. I don't want to throw them away already, because they still look pretty good.</p>

<p>The only thing I tried is sticking <b>glue</b> inside the hole.
This wasn't a good idea, because the glue gets hard and doesn't stick well to the inside of the sole.</p>
","<p>Depending on the type of hole, you can get away with using some silicon. They sell them (primarily for cars) in a container that resembles a toothpaste container. Dry your shoe thoroughly, then apply the silicon to the hole, and try to fill the entire hole. If the hole goes all the way through the shoe, then also try the duct tape on the inside to provide another layer of protection. Important thing, get the silicon in all the nooks and crannies of the hole, otherwise water will just come through. They also sell silicon in multiple colors, so for a few bucks, you can have some stylin' shoes that keep your feet dry.</p>

<p>Just kidding, any <strong>acid-like vegetable/fruit</strong> is fine:)</p>

<p>In order for <strong>a fruit or vegetable be a battery</strong>, it needs to be able to conduct electricity (<strong>acids make H+ ions/charged particles</strong>, when put in a solution like water). These type of acid particles are the same as in electric current. So in other words, more acidic, then better (or more sour it taste, it more acidic). As you can guess, <strong>a lemon</strong> would make a better battery than banana, however less power than a potato!</p>

<p>To use lemons, for 1.5V you may need around 3-5 lemons connected in series. You can use a copper penny/nail and a galvanized/zinc nail into each side to create +/- terminals). In example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The AOA recommends washing glasses every morning, paying special
  attention to the frames and earpieces, where hair product and makeup
  tend to rub off. Whatever you do, don't use the most handy form of
  water to clean your lenses. ""Some people use spit, but don't,"" urges
  Dr. Geist. Though dirty glasses won't cause an eye infection, saliva
  ""is not the best hygiene method, and it just won't work very well,""
  she says. Soap, warm water and a dry cloth are all you need, once a
  day, to keep glasses optimally clean and functional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So taking from that you would have to specify what type of lens you had. Different lens need different treatment:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Glass lens</strong>: Can be cleaned with mild soap and/ or plain water. To dry air drying or wiping with the cleanest cloth possible is appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plastic Lens</strong>: You probably shouldn't use any soap or rough clothes as these can be very tender. I had plastic lenses and they can be scratched by using harsh clothes and the plastic can be ruined by soaps. Also, dry after a rinse in water with air or with a clean soft cloth. </p>

<hr></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What not to do:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Never use newspaper or paper towels. Tissues are more appropriate and babywipes on plastic lenses are a no.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>the reason your shirt is terrible for cleaning glasses is because it's
  likely filled with dust, and that scratches the lenses. Otherwise, any
  old piece of cotton will do, and regular old kitchen soap is far
  better than those cleaning solutions you get at the optometrist</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I was wondering if anyone had any good methods of cutting / ripping paper that would leave it with straight and smooth edges?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously I have tried the simple fold and rip method, but it always starts to veer off track as soon as it gets to the important part of the document in question Any new methods or more advanced methods that people know?</p>
","<p>The fold-and-rip method works or doesn't work based on the type of paper you are working with. Paper that is made on rolls (most office paper, newsprint, paper towel, etc) has a 'grain'. The pulp fibers all align in a certain direction (typically with office paper, the long direction). </p>

<p>It's quite easy to fold-and-tear this type of paper along this axis. It's rather difficult along the other axis.</p>

<p>Some ways to make this easier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do a double fold (fold one way, then the other, to try and break the fibers along the fold)</li>
<li>Once folded, find a solid straight edge to lay on one side of the fold, and then tear the other side in an upward motion along the straight edge</li>
<li>Prior to tearing, moisten the fold to help loosen the fibers.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the day, though, you'll still find that you can't do this successfully 100% of the time. The paper's grain just makes that difficult. </p>

<p>The other way to make paper is via matts/screens. In this scenario, there is no grain as the pulp fibers align themselves all in random directions. Paper made on matts tends to be artist's papers such as watercolor paper, thick cotton rag, printmaking paper, etc. </p>

<p>These papers are actually incredibly easy to tear along a straight line with just a straight edge. No need for fold at all. </p>

<p>Other ways to cut paper if you have a good straight edge to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>run a knife along the straight edge</li>
<li>run a 'roller cutter' along the straight edge (typically used to cut fabric)</li>
<li>open up your scissors and use one side as a knife blade along the straight edge.</li>

  <p>Hydrogen peroxide is known for keeping teeth clean and white, and many
  people use it instead of toothpaste. Jessica on Facebook suggests,
  “Dip your toothbrush in hydrogen peroxide and then in a 50/50 mixture
  of baking soda and fine sea salt.” The only potential problem with
  hydrogen peroxide is if you have amalgam fillings: peroxide may leach
  mercury from your fillings.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Natural Soaps - Sure these work, but they may have a nasty taste, make sure they are natural.  I use castille. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, you can brush your teeth with soap. I’ve tried this one a few
  times, and while it does work, it also tastes pretty, well, soapy. Not
  exactly the natural toothpaste experience I was looking for
  personally. But if you decide to try it, trying a natural soap like
  peppermint castile soap.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Dry brushing or using just water - These are unfavourable because the nice flavour is not there, but if you floss all bases are covered. Uses teas like peppermint might help, though. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>doesn't get much more simple than this. Tired of looking for a natural
  toothpaste alternative? According to some, there’s no need to use
  anything at all: dry brushing does the job. But while it does seem to
  work well enough, there’s no minty mouth feel (like we’re all used to,
  of course) and might feel a little strange.</p>

"How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?","12880","","<p>Every morning when my alarm clock wakes me up, I need very badly to use the snooze function which turns off the alarm for some minutes and starts it again. This costs me 10-40 minutes every morning...</p>

<p>It doesn't matter how long I sleep. I just can't resist using it, but I'd rather like to get up on the first alarm or at least after the first snooze. I tried to simply not use it, but it failed and I fell asleep and slept too long.</p>

<p>The problem isn't that big when I get up at around noon. I don't like to get up early in the morning, but I have to. The sleeping duration also doesn't matter a lot. If I set my clock to 7 am after 8 hours of sleep it's much harder than 11 am after 8 hours of sleep. This also doesn't change when I permanently sleep from 11 pm to 7 am.</p>

<p>Is there a good way to get rid of this habit?</p>

<p><strong>Just to clarify:</strong> I'm looking for any method. May it be some <em>physical</em> hack (like using puzzle alarms or placing the clock unreachable from bed) or a <em>mental/non-physical</em> one(setting up an urgent <em>ToDo</em> right after the alarm goes). I write this because someone voted to close the question because it's off-topic (reason: it's a <em>brain hack</em> question).</p>

<p><strong>Update (about answers):</strong>
Thanks for the many good answers for now. A lot of them will help different types of people. The best for me so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>setup a situation where I urgently need to stand up and stay awake.</p></li>
<li><p>practicing/conditioning by repeating the <em>go to bed and stand up on alarm</em>-algorithm (<a href=""http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/"">Blog post from comments</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>Obviously you do wake up and you are already in such a good shape that you manage to hit the snooze button (and not the finally-off button). So you might also realize that there is not yet an absolute need to get up immediately but you can post-pone this to some minutes later without much of a risk.</p>

<p>So that exactly is where your issue is. You need to pull yourself together to  get up. Being sleepy is extremely counter-productive here.</p>

<p>What worked for me is to introduce an urgent need to get up <strong>right now</strong>, not a minute or two later. This can be achieved with two easy hacks:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Set the alarm to the latest possible time</strong> when you really really need to get up to just about make it to get to work in time. You know you will be late if you had pressed on snooze only once.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not use an alarm with a snooze button</strong>. You will then know that you will oversleep if you turn it off. This alone will help you a lot to actually get up, and not to go back to bed again.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, if we are lucky, we can try to slowly re-adjust our sleep/wake cycle by getting to bed earlier. This can not be done with one or two tries but it needs several days if not weeks. It then may help to better wake up in the morning but it is at the cost of losing all our evenings (which was the main reason it did not work out for me).</p>

"How to remove / prevent burns on a shirt from an iron?","12851","","<p>So recently whenever I've been ironing my shirts for work I have found that when I do the collar of cuffs, the iron will sometimes leave a brown stain, almost as if it is burning the shirts. I don't believe that is would be burning them as it is only the cuffs and collars that suffer this fate but the rest of the shirt is fine.<br>
Just before / when it leaves the mark the iron seems to become 'sticky', ie. not gliding over the shirt surface as easily as it normally does. (I don't know if that is key but thought it might be worth mentioning).</p>

<p>Now I don't know whether this is because the iron is dirty or a different reason but I am looking for handy / easy ways to:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Clean the iron</li>
<li>Remove the marks from the shirts</li>
<li>Prevent this from happening in the future  </li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone else has experienced this I would very much like to here how you sorted it (preferably not by getting a new iron).</p>
","<p>The stain you see on your shirts likely are not burns of the textile but discoloured remnants of skin oil or sweat which were insufficiently cleaned by your machine, especially after your textiles could not be cleaned at high temperatures.</p>

<p>To remove these stains, and to prevent this to happen in the future, collars and cuffs may need a special pre-treatment before putting them into the washing machine.</p>

<ul>
<li>gently rub in <strong>liquid washing lotion</strong> to collar and cuff before washing.</li>
<li>apply some drops of <strong>dishwashing fluid</strong> or <strong>shampoo</strong> (with your finger) to the stains.</li>
<li>use <strong>bleach</strong> only if your shirt was plain white.</li>
<li><strong>bile (ox gall) soap</strong> applied before washing will efficiently remove not only oil but also proteins left on the shirt.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these may help to prevent staining but may be less efficient in removing them. This very much depends on the detailed compositions of the stains (predominatly oil, more sweat, nicotin stains, ...) so we will have to try out what method works best.</p>

<p>From my own experience I had best results by using a liquid bile soap preparation.</p>

"I'm in the rain without an umbrella, how can I get home quickly without getting too wet?","12631","","<p>Often, a problem I encounter is that in rainy seasons the rains come really suddenly. It is really difficult to find stores or pedestrians who are kind enough to lend an umbrella to a stranger (in this case, the poor stranger is me), and I end up getting stuck under a random canopy waiting for the rain to stop.</p>

<p><strong>What can I do to get home quickly (or make progress doing so) without an umbrella and avoiding getting wet when I'm stuck in the rain?</strong></p>
","<p>Order a taxi to take you straight to your home. For this case, I keep telephone numbers of trusted taxis in my pocket. While waiting, eat a sandwich in the nearest cafe :)</p>

<p>If you have such a jacket, then pull its hood on your head and zip your zipper.</p></li>
<li>If you know a good way to your home with many bus stops, <strong>use it</strong>.</li>
<li>If there is no such a way or you don't know it, try to get to the nearest underground station</li>

<li>If possible don't run against the rain so as not allow the rain to pour your eyes, choose the ways to run along with it</li>
</ol>

<p>And, by the way, if you are planning to use newspaper (non-glossy one), I wouldn't recommend to do it in the heavy rain due to the terrible personal experience. I am not saying this about magazines - they are quite good ""tool"" to ""harbor"" from rain.</p>

  four handfuls; it’s that easy. If you need a tablespoon, teaspoon or
  something similar, pay close attention the next time you measure
  something. Place it in the palm of your hand before adding it to
  whatever you’re cooking and notice how much space it takes up in your

","<p>I've used three techniques in the past for this kind of thing.</p>

<p><strong>Wipe it off</strong>.  If the surface is relatively non-absorbant, then a wet-wipe should be able to lift the pen off.  I've saved miswritten birthday cards in the past this way.</p>

<p><strong>Abrasion</strong>.  If you're writing on unwaxed paper or card, and have used a biro instead of a fountain pen, you can (very carefully) scrape away the top layer of paper immediately where you have written on.  Use anything hard that won't leave a mark, and go slow!  The ink will be removed with the top layer.  Practice this technique before using on something important!</p>

<p><strong>Paint</strong>.  If you have access to a decent painting set, you can effectively make your own White-Out in whatever colour you need.  Ideally, you need acrylics - it'll give you an finish very similar to White-Out.  Water colours won't cut it.</p>

<p>If you use one particular colour often, consider investing in a <a href=""http://www.posca.com/uk/all-material-markers"" rel=""noreferrer"">POSCA paint marker</a>.  They come in a large range of colours, and will allow you to effortlessly cover over any mistakes as easily as White-Out.</p>

<p><strong>Baking Soda:</strong> This works if you apply it to a dry surface. Over time you may have to have to reapply, but it works. Here is a recipe, but I just use plain baking soda:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using baking soda as a deodorant is a
  simple way to combat body odor without subjecting your pits to a
  variety of chemicals. Mix an eighth of a teaspoon of baking soda with
  a little bit of water — don't dissolve it — and rub it under your
  arms. You can also create a baking soda and cornstarch mix to fight
  odor and help prevent wetness. Simply mix one part baking soda with
  six parts cornstarch and dust a little on your underarms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Shaving you underarms:</strong> To get rid of the smell, shaving your underarms can work. But in a pinch this tip may be worthless.</p>

<p><strong>Using scented antimicrobial soaps:</strong> Soaps such as Tea Tree oil and Peppermint can kill the odour causing bacteria and leave you fresh and clean smelling. </p>

<p><strong>Lemon Juice</strong>: This may burn if you have any open wounds. You can even use non-sugar lemonade as a cleansing solution. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The citric acid in lemon juice can kill odor-causing
  bacteria, and there are people who swear by the lemon deodorizing
  method. Jennifer Palmer, chief executive of an organic skincare line,
  told The New York Times that she swipes her armpits with a sliced
  lemon on a daily basis. Just be sure not to apply lemon juice to
  recently shaven armpits — ouch!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rubbing Alcohol: All these methods I use and they are cheap. The alcohol may burn if applied to fresh shaven arms or wounds. These include hand sanitizers, but make sure the are healthy before applying them to yourself. These really work in a pinch. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rubbing alcohol is another inexpensive and easy deodorant that kills
  odor-causing bacteria. Simply fill a spray bottle with alcohol and
  spritz your underarms with it. You can even add a few drops of your
  favorite essential oil to give it a scent — witch hazel absorbs oil
  and is mildly astringent, and tea tree oil can help relieve body odor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Just cleaning really quick works. If you bring some soap you can probably wash up real fast, baby wipes and other cleansing solutions ready work wonders.</em></strong> </p>

<p>Making solutions out of essential oils work, but make sure you aren't allergic. Mixing a peppermint or Tea Tree Oil and water solution works, as well. </p>

","<p>Removing the cause of the problem rather than the problem itself is the only real solution to <strong>permanently</strong> remove mould .</p>

<p>For mould the usual culprit is <strong>moisture</strong>. In most cases the moisture will come from one of two places:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the moisture is coming from the air (e.g. a steamy bathroom or a cold hallway) the problem is <em>managed</em> (perhaps not completely fixed) by removing moisture from the air. To remedy this you can try:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use an <strong>electric</strong> dehumidifier (the little salt block ones simply aren't efficient enough)</li>
<li>Keep the area well <strong>ventilated</strong>, open windows and doors</li>
<li>Don't add moisture unnecessarily, e.g. use an <strong>extractor fan</strong> if cooking or showering generates a lot of steam.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If the moisture is coming through the walls, floor or ceiling, the problem is much more difficult and will probably require a <em>professional</em> damp proofing course.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to remove the mould <strong><em>completely</em></strong> to reduce the chance of spores multiplying again. The chemical sprays you use already are probably enough for this.</p>

"How to prevent outline marks on trousers?","10896","","<p>Some of you may have noticed that if you have fairly tight trousers on - such as chinos - if you have anything in your pocket, such as a phone, ID card, or coins and such things, after a while outlines of the objects become visible on the outside of the trousers.<br>
For me it mostly occurs if I rub against the object and apply pressure to outside of the material, then I find it becomes more prominent and happens more quickly than if just left in the pocket.</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone knew how to prevent this from happening?</p>

<p>My trousers are quite new and I assume that this could somewhat amplify the effects as they have not yet been washed but it has happened on some of my older clothes as well which is getting a tad tiresome!</p>
","<p>You can carry your objects in a bag: your cellphone, wallet, keys and other things you used to carry in your pocket. There are many bags for woman or for man, you can look very modern carring such a bag or backpack. There are different sizes and you can choose if you want to carry many things or just keys, a cellphone and some money. There are bags for important documents which you can hide under your shirt. And I have seen a belt with zippers on the inner side for hiding small objects.</p>

<p>Otherwise you can put these objects in your jacket not in your trousers.</p>

<p>You can hang a key on your neck tied with a textile band like a necklace.</p>

<p>Put some money in your bra. Some girls keep there a mp3 player while walking.</p>

You will be amazed at how much caked on and dried up ink is actually gunked up inside of the nib.</p>

"How do I separate multiple 5-gallon buckets efficiently?","10580","","<p>Related to <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/2329/how-do-i-separate-2-drinking-glasses-that-are-stuck"">How do I separate 2 drinking glasses that are stuck?</a>, but also quite different. Sometimes I have some <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/400/6a/6ad09751-e8ff-4a72-a1fd-68dd7d799a22_400.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">plastic five gallon buckets</a> stacked up (usually 2 or 3, sometimes 4) for storage, and they slowly sink together. I might not need them for years. Then when I do need them, I can get them apart, but at some expense:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I poke a nail-hole in the bottom of one, it will release the vacuum, and the bucket will come away. Not good if you intend to use the bucket for liquids, like I usually do.</p></li>
<li><p>I can get the air compressor, plug it in, wait for it to pump up, find a hose and fittings, put them on, jam the end between the buckets, and blast in some air. They pop apart nicely. However, the air pump isn't always in working order, and sometimes I have this problem in places where the folks don't have a compressor.</p></li>
<li><p>Holding the buckets between your knees firmly, and twisting the top one. Doesn't work on tight buckets. You can do this for 1/2 hour sometimes to no avail. Same with the method of rolling the buckets, squashing them a little, rolling them, squashing them again, etc. It works unless the buckets are real tight.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting a narrow steel rod and jamming it between the buckets to let in some air. It works also, but I avoid it as it deforms the buckets.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure if there are any conventional methods, because this isn't really supposed to happen. Now you know my problem, and the methods I've tried, and why they weren't satisfactory. What is an efficient way to get multiple five gallon buckets un-stuck that doesn't involve taking a long time (20 mins or longer is a long time), and doesn't involve deforming/defacing the buckets?</p>
","<p>As you've probably figured out by now the reason the buckets are so hard to separate is the vacuum, or negative air pressure, that forms when you're trying to pull them apart.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IAhsH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>By applying force trying to pull them apart you create more negative pressure making them even harder to pull apart.</p>

<hr>

<p>So now that we understand why this is difficult... What can we do about it?</p>

<p>You could try to equalize the pressure by warming the buckets and the air inside, in theory this may work. As the air molecules heat up they begin to move faster and bounce against the buckets more reducing the negative pressure slightly. The down sides to this approach are obvious though, heating the buckets will also cause the plastic to expand which may make separating them more difficult and heating the buckets isn't always easy. </p>

<p>As mentioned you could try to lubricate the buckets as you pull them apart, once again this may work, and once again it has downsides. Even though the lubricant may reduce friction it makes the vacuum problem slightly worse because you're filling the space that could have allowed air to pass through.
<hr>
After some experimentation I've found that rinsing the buckets with water and applying a little pressure and being patient may be the best method.</p>

<p>More specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spray down the buckets inside and out with plain water, mostly to clean them, but it may provide some small amount of lubrication.</li>
<li>Wedge a flat head screwdriver between the top edge of one bucket and the rib of the next.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jShEM.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></li>
<li>Gently turn the screwdriver and wait a second for the pressure to equalize.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HK7ux.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></li>
<li>Rotate the bucket a couple of inches and repeat steps 2 and 3</li>
</ol>

<p>After going around the bucket, you should be able to slowly pull the buckets apart.</p>

<hr>

<p>Once you have your buckets separated you can prevent them from sticking in the future by placing a piece of cardboard or folded paper between the walls of the buckets when you re-stack them.</p>

So far I try to leave it on a wooden chair close to a heater and unfold it as much as possible (e.g. not leave it crumpled up). I thought about putting it in the clothes dryer but I don't want to damage it by doing this on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Same goes for clothing, especially shoes. While they may not get soaked through, it's uncomfortable putting something that's wet on the outside, back on. For example my jacket is waterproof but inevitably a little water gets inside when I take it off and put it on again. </p>
","<p>For all (backpack, shoes, jacket) I use electric fan which blows warm air at them and highly decreases the time for drying. It is something like a heater with fan and I set it to lowest temperature. Depending on the material of your backpack/shoes/jacket you can use higher temperatures.</p>

","<p>Salt is used to regenerate the dishwasher ion exchange column. It is vital to use pure 100% NaCl without any other additions. This is guaranteed with all products on the market. To ease filling, and dilution it also has a somewhat coarser granularity but this is not decisive.</p>

<p>It is possible to use any other <strong>pure</strong> NaCl-salt as a replacement but alas our table salt used for cooking isn't.

<li>I cannot leave the window open at night because of incidents of a stray cat getting in to the house.</li>

<li><p>Door open method: I have already stated in question that opening the door blocks out both outgoing air and light towards window. So that wont do.</p></li>
<li><p>Camp bed method: I already have a bed and cant afford to buy a camp bed which is really expensive if available in India. There is no such thing as camping in our city-living actually.</p></li>

"Remove ice from freezer / keeping it clean","9181","","<p>So, my freezer looks currently like in the image below, it has an ice sheet on all the walls. Other than in this image, my freezer has drawers that start to be tricky to open and close.</p>

<p>Now, I know that this water comes from a) water vapor from outside when you open the freezer and b) water that sublimates from the contents.</p>

<p>I try to reduce this by opening the freezer as short as possible and keep the contents in plastic bags. This helps, but I still have to thaw the freezer every six months or so.</p>

<p>Currently, when I want to remove the ice, I would stop adding new stuff for a few days. When its kinda empty turn it off and leave the door open so the ice thaws and I can take it out / mop it up.</p>

<p>Thats annoying because it takes long (I have to leave it open the whole night) and I have to disable my fridge as well. So some food gets bad (not so much as the fridge is closed and I stuff all the frozen food from the freezer in there). At least everything that was in the freezer before the thawing needs to be consumed in the next days.</p>

<p>I would like to have a process that either accelerates the ""ice removing"" time significantly or keeps the freezer from icing over.</p>

"How can I store my Christmas lights so that they don't get tangled?","8935","","<p>Every year I attempt to roll up the lights for my Christmas tree in a way that will make them easy to get out the next year, but the next year, inevitably, they're all tangled up and I have to spent time pulling them apart. </p>

<p>Okay, they're not quite as bad as that picture, but they're not great.</p>

Once I'm done with the entire cord, I slide it off my elbow and I've got a the cord wrapped in a circle. While this does indeed work fine for extension cords, I'm guessing the problem with doing this for lights is that the cord isn't smooth... it's got all those lights sticking up off it, after all, and I think everything it's getting tangled and not wrapped as tightly as a result.</p>

<p>Does anyone have tips for better storing these so that they're easy to get out the next year?</p>
","<p>Seeing as how I usually have some new cardboard boxes lying around when it's time to take down the lights, I tear off chunks and wrap my lights around them, similar to what's shown below. Typically, I'll cut notches along two sides so the cord sits in the notches and won't slide around. That lets each coil be closer to the next as I'm sure they won't tangle. </p>

"How Can I Fix a Broken Fly? (As in ""Pants"" not ""Insects"")","8913","","<p>My wardrobe is not aging gracefully, and I too much despise shopping for clothes to replace it. To be sure, after a long, gradual decline, it has gotten to a point where if I pull out a pair of pants, it is a great surprise to me if the zipper on my fly still functions in its original capacity. More commonly, I will pull out a pair of sad pants with two rows of teeth to form a fly, but either no zipper or a zipper only attached to one set of the teeth. Personally, I couldn't care less whether the zipper works, but I've been told that it is <em>most uncivilized</em> to walk around with one's fly hanging open, and that explaining, ""No, it's okay because it's broken!"" does not, in fact, make it more civilized. Thus, I would like, at least, to elegantly ensure that my pants do not have a hole where the fly once was sagging open when I am wearing them.</p>

<p>I consider this problem very annoying. So far I have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the sliding bit of the zipper stayed on one side, I've tried shoving the other side of teeth into the appropriate slot in the sliding bit, but I've never succeeded in fixing them this way.</p></li>
<li><p>I've tried avoiding other people all day. This is a nice universal fix to all wardrobe issues, but it's sort of hard to do - and it gets tiresome to have to figure out when no one's looking before making a dash across more public space.</p></li>
<li><p>I <em>once</em> tried putting the pants on backwards. This looked even worse and felt terrible.</p></li>
<li><p>I used tape to hold the fly shut. It sort of works for a while, but eventually the tape gets unstuck. It's also kind of noticeable and I'd rather not have any conversations starting with, ""Hey dude, why's there so much duct tape on your pants?""</p></li>
<li><p>I managed to run a loop of little wire through the pants and through the zipper to hold the fly closed in the middle; this works the best out of anything I've tried, but the pants still look kind of strange, being held together at just one point in the middle.</p></li>
<li><p>I thought about soldering the zipper (mostly) shut, since I don't really care whether it can open or not, however decided against it since it would leave that section of the pants stiff. (Not to mention that this is an issue I invariably wish to solve <em>after</em> I've left my house - in locations where one will receive strange looks if they start soldering their pants together or remove their pants to safely do so - though, perhaps with some good answers here, I can remember to fix my pants before trying to use them).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these solutions are particularly satisfactory to me and I feel like this has <em>got</em> to be a common problem. Is there a better way to repair one's fly?</p>
","<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sew a few stitches into the pants where the zipper is. This keeps the zipper together, but is hard to take apart for bathroom breaks or generally to change them if you have tight pants. If you have loose pants or wear a belt then the pants will be turned into slipons. There are 2 way I can think of doing this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanket_stitch"" rel=""nofollow"">whipstitich</a> or other stitch to the zipper while the zipper apparatus is still there. A Whipstitch or blanket stitch may be to bulky and you may opt for another stitch. </p></li>
<li><p>Remove the Zipper by the stitches that hold it into the pants or just try cutting it out. Then just sew the left over flaps together so it looks like it was meant to be that way.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Use a safety pin. Using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_pin#Nappy_Pin"" rel=""nofollow"">large diaper pin</a> or several safety pins would keep them together and these can be reused. Be careful when adding then though, you can sick yourself if you are not careful. </p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Replace-Jean-Zippers"" rel=""nofollow"">Change the zipper</a>. Buy or ""borrow"" one from other pants. Zippers are not to expensive and can be found in other pants, so if you wore out some pants, you have a zipper. </p></li>
<li><p>Wear a longer shirt. This makes sure the problem isn't shown, as the shirt will cover the zipper and the problem. Avoid bending backward and winds that will blow up the shirt.  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Alternative Solution</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't wear zipper pants. If you wear elastic and other pants, and not zipper pants then your fly will not wear out. </p></li>
<li><p>Change the zipper to elastic. If you proactively change the zipper, then the problem is avoided. </p></li>

<li><p>You can go to a tailor other clothes fixers and have them fix it for you. They can also probably do other repairs such as fix holes adjust pants length.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatives to sewing are sticky sewing adhesives that can be Ironed or applied with other heat. These adhesives may work better as it allows a person to take something a loose more and may be easier for people without sewing skills.   </p></li>

"How do you get into or out of a car during rain without getting wet?","8766","","<p>Umbrellas are wonderful things.  They keep the majority of your body dry in most types of rain.  Cars are also wonderful things.  They get you from place to place regardless of the weather, and give you a chance to dry off during the trip.  However, these two wonderful things don't play nice together.  Trying to get into a car while holding an umbrella is an exercise in frustration and dampness.  </p>

<p>If you put the umbrella in first, you're standing unprotected in the rain (albeit briefly, but long enough to get wet) and it will drip on your seat as you reach across it.  If you get in first, while protecting yourself with the umbrella, you now have to somehow fold the umbrella and get it into the car without it dripping on you.  In either scenario, you still have to reach out into the rain to close the door, and depending on the angle of the rain, your unprotected side may get soaked before you do. </p>

<p>If you're short and/or flexible, you can try getting in through the passenger-side door, followed by your umbrella, which then doesn't have to cross the car... but if you can't easily slide from the passenger to the driver's seat, you're trying to contort yourself around while avoiding a wet umbrella.</p>

<p>All that is a long way to ask: <strong>How can you get from under an umbrella into a car in the rain, without getting wet?</strong></p>

<p>Ideally, any answer will work in reverse, too - after all, it may not have stopped raining by the time you get to your destination.  But just getting into the car dry is enough for now, because you can always keep a spare (dry) umbrella in the car to use while getting out.</p>
","<p>I usually tend to get into the car, partly close the door with the umbrella held just high enough to go over the door. Hold the top part with your right hand, and move the bottom handle up to fold the umbrella with your left hand. After closing, move it inside the car, and close the door.</p>

<p>This procedure works well enough for me, not to have considered any other options. Can get a little wet on the bottom of my arms, but otherwise both me and the car is dry! I store the umbrella between my seat and the door, so it is ready for the next time it rains. </p>

<h3>Fan Brush</h3>

<p>Do not use these, too flimsy and they do not clean well.</p>

"How can I prevent windows from steaming up at night?","8224","","<p>It's winter here, which means that in our old house the windows get condensation forming on the inside overnight in the rooms where people sleep. Sometimes there is so much that it streams down and makes puddles on the windowsill. </p>

<p>Is there any way to stop this happening? I can't put things on the windowsill at the moment as they'd get ruined by the water.</p>
","<p>Condensation is formed when warm air meets the cold glass and the water vapour in the air condenses into water droplets.</p>

<p>There are a few ways you can mitigate this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Warm the glass. This is extremely energy-inefficient (with the associated expense and detriment to the environment that that implies), but warming the glass by pointing a fan heater at it or installing a radiator beneath it and turning the heat up high would reduce the effect of cold air hitting the window.</p></li>
<li><p>Install thicker curtains. This better insulates the warm room-air from reaching the cold glass in the first place (not to mention keeping your room warmer) which will reduce the effect of condensation.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the room colder. Instead of using radiators and heaters to warm the entire room, use hot water bottles and blankets to warm only the space that you sleep in. There will be less of a temperature difference between inside and outside, resulting in less condensation on the windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Buy a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumidifier"">dehumidifier</a>. By taking the water vapour out of the air, there will be less water to condense on the glass. Following on from this, use extraction fans when boiling water on the stove or running a bath or shower (or keep the kitchen/bathroom doors shut) to prevent humid air from escaping to the rest of the house.</p></li>
<li><p>A lifehack-y version of the dehumidifier option would be to keep a large jar of silica gel or other dehumidifying chemical (talc?) near to the window. I'm not sure how effective this would be without cycling the air; my suspicion would be that the warm humid air would rise above the silica gel unless you put it really high up. However, I included it so that you can experiment if you so desire.</p></li>

Nowadays 99.34% of labels are of the self-adhesive variety, laser-cut with embossings, metallic and plastic finishings and coatings and seemed to be designed to military specifications NOT to be removed. </p>

<p>I am a home-brewer and need a supply of clean re-usable wine bottles, and removing these modern labels is a chore.</p>

<p>I have tried the following but I may have missed some good ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>soaking in water... this sometimes sort of works - it seems to depend on the quality of the paper versus the power of the glue.  Fails often on coated labels. Resort to scraping with a potato peeler. If that fails bin it.  ~ 5% chance of success</p></li>
<li><p>VERY carefully pick up a corner and peel it off by hand. When it rips, try a different corner. Again this depends on the paper quality vs glue and seems to critically depend on the angle of peel. Good approach for coated labels. Often you can succeed in doing this on the front label then fail totally on the 2 back labels which have an entirely different constituency. ~ 5% chance again</p></li>
<li><p>Lighter fluid.  from an old trick in removing floppy disk labels - tiddle lighter fluid liberally over the entire surface of the label (only works on non-coated labels) so that it soaks thru the paper into the backing glue. I use my fingers to spread it. Wait until it just appears to have dried - then peel as for 2.  If it rips - you can try repeating the whole process. Often leaves gluey residue.  Use a paper towel and more lighter fluid to remove it, and polish it off.  ~ 70% chance.</p></li>
<li><p>heat bottle in slow oven oven at ~100C. use gloves and try and peel label with other hand. Some skill/risk required  ~ 40% chance</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ok what methods have I missed? and what are the estimated chances of success?</p>

<p>P.S. you will need to successfully remove labels to try the bottle-chopping hack <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/3656/what-is-the-best-method-for-cutting-the-top-off-a-wine-bottle"">What is the best method for cutting the top off a wine bottle?</a></p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/skills/how-to-remove-a-bottle-label"">Popular Mechanics</a> the most effective method was using baking soda and water:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>Baking Soda and Water</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Directions:</strong> Three bottles, 16 tablespoons of baking soda and 32 cups
  of water, soak for 30 minutes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Results:</strong> After 30 minutes, the bucket had two full labels floating on
  the top—a very good sign. One bottle required a peel of the main
  label, which came off cleanly—and another bottle was good to go with a
  simple wipe of the rag. The third bottle, however, proved more
  difficult. Although the top label floated away during the soak, the
  main label required fingernail peeling and steel wool (although it was
  a clean swipe with the steel wool, unlike with the soap-and-water
  method).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Score:</strong> 8 out of 10</p>

"How can I quickly cool coffee to a drinkable temperature?","8138","","<p>Most of the time before going to work I really enjoy eating my breakfast while watching some documentary, but then I notice that I am quite late so I will hurry to eat my breakfast. Then the problem arises where I want to drink my coffee, but can't drink it easily because it is still too hot. Are there any methods to cool it enough so I can easily drink it in a short time?</p>

<li><p><strong>Pour the contents from cup to cup</strong>. This may take sometimes. Chilling the mug beforehand works wonders. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take your drink and pour it from one cup to the other cup. If your cup
  goes higher, then more air will go through it, making it colder. Don't
  make your cup go too high, after pouring, it might bounce a few drops
  and land on your arms. It will burn!</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Ice cubes</strong>. This method works if you drink the beverage fast, otherwise, the Ice Cubes melt and the beverage is watered down, unfavorable.Or you could wrap the ice cubes in foil as it still makes it cold but it won't be watered down quite as much</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put one or two ice cubes in your hot drink.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>WikiHow, says add 1 or 2, but I usually add more. Also, making milk ice cubes works, because it doesn't water down the drink. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Put your Milk, cream, and/or sugar into the refrigerator freezer and pour them into the coffee when you want to drink it.</strong> This way the coffee gets tasty and cool. Mixing the sugar and milk together and then freezing it is an amazing hack to save time when preparing coffee because just throw the ice cubes in when you want sugar and milk/cream.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Ice and Salt</strong>. I have never used this method. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put the drink inside its cup into a closed container. Put some ice
  sprinkled with salt into the closed container (not into the drink
  cup). Let sit briefly. Your drink will be cold in a matter of
  minutes.</p>

This will require <em>a lot</em> of rubbing. </p>

<p>@Shoket suggested I add these details from our comments below: The reason I'm asking this question now, is because I recently cleaned house, threw out a bunch of old socks with holes, and bought 8 pairs of new socks, which started getting holes within a month. </p>
","<p>What I would do is wear 2 two slightly thinner pairs of socks. The reason this works:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Friction between the shoe and the sock is the cause for the ""holey"" socks.  </li>
  <li>If you wear two pairs of socks, the thickness of them combined will add extra ""cushion"", which will reduce friction.  </li>
  <li>The remaining friction is not a problem because only the outside sock will be slightly worn, while the inside sock will remain protected by the outside sock.</li>

<li>The seat is rubbing on the pants.</li>
<li>The fabric is not sufficiently durable.</li>

<p>I ride a bike to work, so know from experience. Cheap, thin, coarse-weave polyester fabric is best. It is cool and doesn't hold water when you get hot and sweat. Not being jeans they are a bit looser and the fabric holds up better than denim. Such are surprisingly inexpensive costing less than jeans if one looks around. They can be bought at places like blair.com. I have several pairs from there lasting several years of daily bike riding. Riding a bike regularly requires a change in clothing style to facilitate comfortable riding.</p>

<p>The seat can be changed. Harder seats work better than soft ones for several reasons, and you are best off getting a thin racing-style seat with a small bit of springiness to it. A racing-style seat will cause less wear to clothing and offers more comfort.</p>

<p>The fans are designed to blow hot air either to the back or to the sides, and suck air in also from either the sides or back. Placing the laptop directly on a fabric surface plugs the vents.

<p>Method 1: Slightly damp</p>

<li>Remove as much liquid as possible from the book by taking it out of the puddle and carefully shaking off the liquid.</li>
<li>Blot the affected pages, preferably with a towel (cloth, not a paper towel).</li>
<li>Assess how much of the book has gotten wet. If a certain portion is still dry, insert something between the wet portion and the dry portion to prevent the liquid soaking the whole thing while you prepare for the next step.</li>
<li>Plug in your iron. Turn it to a very gentle setting (silk, for example) and wait for it to heat up. Turn off the steam.</li>
<li>Place your book on your ironing board and carefully single out a wet page. Be careful not to tear it.</li>
<li>Take a piece of absorbent paper like a paper towel (or a piece of toilet paper)and place it on your wet book page.</li>
<li>Place your warm iron on the tissue and move it carefully from side to side. If you can't do it without creating wrinkles in the tissue, press it down, then lift it up, set it down a little to the left or right of your original spot, and continue.</li>
<li>Check the page under the tissue to see how dry it is. Repeat the former step until you achieve your desired dryness.</li>
<li>Continue with this method until you have dried all affected pages of your book. Use new pieces of absorbent paper for every page, as needed.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Method 2: Soaked - If your book falls into some water and it's floating.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check carefully the position of the book while it floats and attempt to catch it gently. Place your hands inside the water beneath the book and lift it as not to rip up the frail paper.</li>
<li>If the book is completely soaked, trying the method above will rip the paper. If even the cover is wet you should put down the book on a warm and clean surface. Good options are a boat's deck in the sun, a balcony, a car's hood or concrete floor, if you watch it so that no one else picks it up.</li>
<li>Try to access the extent of the damage by trying to flip the pages of the book. If you can see the next page's writing through the first don't pull them apart.</li>
<li>Flip the book every so often, to ensure it dries throughout.</li>
<li>When the pages are tough enough to read as a regular book but it still feels moist, you may try the first method used above for smaller amounts of liquids.</li>
</ol>

<p>Method 3: Using a hairdryer. This works well for both for damp and soaked books.</p>

"How to keep water from boiling over?","6824","","<p>It's very common to boil something (e.g. pasta) and then after few minutes you hear the hissing sound of water boiling over and your whole kitchen is a mess.</p>

<p>How do you stop the water from boiling over?</p>
","<p>Most of the time when you need boiling water you don't need to keep it at a rolling boil. I've found that the best way to keep things from boiling over is to reduce the heat slightly, so while the water is still boiling it's not quite so vigorous.</p>

"How to keep leftover pizza tasting fresh","6821","","<p>Whenever I order pizza, I always have some leftovers. I'll usually have them in the next day or two, but they never taste as good. I don't know if it's how I store the pizza (in aluminum foil in the fridge) or how I reheat it (in a microwave), but they never have the crispiness that I want (it's too soggy). <strong>How can I store and reheat pizza so that it tastes like I just bought it?</strong> </p>
","<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Get an airtight plastic container and line it with paper towels. Place a piece of pizza on the paper towels, then place some more paper towels on top. If you have more than one piece of pizza, repeat until all of the pieces are stored. If you plan to eat the pizza in the next 24 hours, store it in the fridge. Any time longer than that, store it in the freezer. </p>

<h2>Reheating</h2>

<p>Before you reheat, let the pizza warm up to room temperature/</p>

<h3>Oven (best when you have a lot of pizza)</h3>

<p>Preheat oven to 400<sup>o</sup>. Place the pizza on a baking sheet and bake it for 15 minutes. The pizza is good if the cheese is bubbly and crispy brown in spots.</p>

<h3>Toaster Oven (best for one or two slices)</h3>

<p>Preheat to 400<sup>o</sup>. Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 10 minutes. The cheese should look bubbly and gooey.</p>

<h3>Microwave (quickest, but least effective)</h3>

<p>Put not only the pizza (on a microwave safe plate is usually the best) in the microwave, but also put a half-filled glass of water. The water will prevent the heatwaves from going deep inside the pizza, making it only heat the crust and cheese. Reheat for 30 seconds.</p>

","<p>When moving a cement mixer recently I used a small trailer, and self built ramp. The ramp consisted of two lengths of wood, 2""x4"" (48 mm x 198 mm) and 5 ft (150 cm) length. Here is an image of how you could make the ramp:</p>

<p>The trick to using lenghts of wood for a ramp, is to make sure that they doesn't break nor slip. Proper dimensioned planks ensure no breaking, but do take care when using the ramp. And here are some ideas to reduce the risk of slipping:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong>: Make a lip at the end of the wooden planks which goes down into the trunk</li>
<li><strong>B</strong>: Let the end of the planks stop against the curb, if possible</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: In a pinch, you could temporarily take out two car mats, place one over the trunk edge to protect the trunk edge, and put another under the end of plank to increase the friction</li>
</ul>

<p>When utilising the ramp, push the lawn mover unto the bottom part first and wiggle it a little to make sure the ramp is stable. Now simply push it into the car, possibly shifting grips to the lower end of the lawn mover handles when halfway up the ramp.</p>

<p>Let it gently go down into the trunk on the front wheels, and fasten it securely. Remember to pick up the planks, and stick into truck before driving off. </p>

"How can I watch a 3D movie if I already wear glasses","6674","","<p>To watch a 3D movie, I need to wear special glasses to create the illusion of depth and create the feel of a 3D scene in the brain.</p>

<p>What is the best way for people wearing glasses to watch comfortably a 3D movie.  </p>
","<p>There are a couple ways to go about a clip-on solution that might be appealing to people not comfortable wearing contacts or glasses over glasses. </p>

<p><strong>DIY Version</strong></p>

<p>There is a detailed post about creating <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Clips-For-Prescription-Glasses/"" rel=""nofollow"">3D Clips For Prescription Glasses</a> that addresses this precise issue.</p>

<p><strong>The simplified version is</strong>: use a set of clip-on sunglasses, harvest the lenses from a set of theater glasses, pop the lenses out of the clip-on, use them as a template to cut replacements from the 3D glasses, and pop in your new 3D lenses. </p>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: I'm comfortable wearing 3D glasses over my glasses so I have not used this DIY technique.</em></p>

<p><strong>Commercial options</strong></p>

<p>Companies have figured out that people who wear glasses sometimes want to watch 3D movies and have started producing clip-on solutions. The notable boon to a commercial option is not having to deal with cutting, trimming, fitting, and aligning polarized lenses into a frame they weren't designed for.</p>

<p>A couple examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003ZU0WCI"" rel=""nofollow"">Circular Polarized Clip on 3D Glasses for RealD</a></li>

<p><strong>Caveats</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>Different 3D technologies use different methods of polarization and
it's important to have versions for each</li>
<li>This <em>only</em> works for passive 3D technologies. Active 3D is a whole different ball of wax.</li>

"How to remove large quantity of dust from electronic/mechanical equipment?","6567","","<p>Say for example, I have a computer with many many fans, and which that computer sits on the carpet floor.</p>

<p>What is the best way to get dust, hair, bits of trash, maybe even bugs, out of a moving piece of hardware like a computer fan? Ideally, you should not have to open or disassemble the device.</p>

<p>Would blowing or vacuuming be better? How could I make sure no more dust gets into the machine again?</p>

<p>I have attempted vacuuming: this leaves dust inside the machine.<br>
Blowing: this just gets the dust up in the air where it settles back down again.<br>
Wiping: Very difficult to reach and manipulate a cleaning tool to reach all dust present.</p>
","<p>I would say clean the machine good once a year or twice, timing depends and in between doing this to reduce dust accumulation in the room, because you can't stop it accumulating on the electronic:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove pets, especially birds and cats from the room. These help dust accumulate.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Reduce-Dust-in-Your-House#Seal_Up_Cracks_sub"" rel=""nofollow"">Seal up cracks</a>. Dust can get into the room through these and affect your device.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Reduce-Dust-in-Your-House#Cleaning_Up_Dust_sub"" rel=""nofollow"">Clean dust frequently</a>. Dust that accumulates in the room can get into the device. Airing a room is important, but avoid hot dusty days.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Reduce-Dust-in-Your-House#Clearing_Away_Clutter_sub"" rel=""nofollow"">Remove cluttering items</a> and pack away things neatly. Dust can accumulate in corners and on objects.</p></li>
<li><p>I haven't really used air purifiers, but I have cleaned air filters, <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Reduce-Dust-in-Your-House#Filtering_the_Air_sub"" rel=""nofollow"">the article</a> says get air purifiers. Air purifiers remove dust and other stuff from the air.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Things I use:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Whisk the outside clean with a brush. This doesn't clean the inside but may loosen inner dust.</p></li>
<li><p>Now swab with cotton swabs, you can get longer ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the swabs probably loosened the dust, taking a vacuum or shop vac and sucking with it should remove loosened dust and the stuff you couldn't reach.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using water should make the dust stick together, which from my experience is not a good thing. Blowing the dust pushes it farther away which is not a good thing either. A cleaning where you take the electronic a part is good to do once or twice a year.</strong></p>

<p>Vacuuming should be done first and then you should do blowing to loosen more dust and finish with more vacuuming. Don't vacuum vigorously as this can loosen and injure pieces of the device.</p>

<p><em>Alternate Methods:</em></p>

<p>Taking microfibre clothe attached to a small long object usually works, as well. You can use this to reach inside of the vents, but make sure you can see through to what you are doing. This loosens dust and can make using a vacuum more effective. </p>

<p><strong><em>Keep in mind that none of these methods work as good as taking the machinery apart. And probing your machine through vents when you have no idea of what you are going to touch is a bad idea. So always make sure you know what you are going to touch and are aware of any dangers. The machine should be off, if not it is not safe and cleaning should not be attempted.</em></strong></p>

  <p>Before completing any cleaning method on your computer, it is

  <p>Shut down the computer and unplug all of the cords from the CPU. Take
  it outside or in an area that is well ventilated. When we get further
  into this process, the dust will start flying.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s bad to clean the inside of your computer with a vacuum cleaner
  because vacuuming creates a large static build up that could (and most
  likely will) discharge into the sensitive electronics inside your
  computer case. There are specialized vacuum cleaners designed for
  cleaning out computers and electronic equipment but given the limited
  amount of use a single user would get from such a purchase it’s not a
  very wise one—they start at $300+ and can easily break the $1000 price
  barrier.</p>
  
  <p>What we’d recommend doing is taking your computer case into a well
  ventilated area (outside on a sunny day or in your garage is a great
  place), grounding the case to protect against static discharge
  (although the risk here is very very low) and using compressed air to
  clean the dust off. If you’re using an air compressor (as opposed to
  just a can of compressed air from the computer store) make sure to
  start a good 24″ or so away from the case and work your way in closer.
  You want to use just enough air pressure to blast the dust off the
  surfaces and out of the case without overdoing it and pushing dust
  into even more difficult to remove places.</p>
  
  <p>One important thing to consider: compressed air (from a compressor,
  not a can) contains minute amounts of water vapor. Although we’ve
  never actually heard of this happening to anyone it is (however remote
  the chance) possible to blow moisture into the connectors on your
  mother board and damage it if you were to boot it immediately
  afterwards. This is in the range of lightening-strike remote, however.
  None the less to be extra cautious we would recommend that you leave
  the computer off and in a warm dry location for a few hours after you
  give it a good air-compressor cleaning to allow any residual moisture
  (if it’s even there to begin with) to evaporate. This borders on
  paranoid caution, mind you, but better safe than sorry.</p>

I also have to do this inside, since I don't have much of a yard outside. How can I make a room less humid, especially on rainy or generally humid days,  so the clothes dry faster?</p>
","<p>Removing humidity from the air is an energy intensive process.  Further, while your clothes will dry faster in a lower humidity environment, they will still dry in a humid environment.</p>

<p>Increasing the airflow, even on humid days, will significantly speed up drying.  The clothes are still more damp than the air, so moving more air past them will remove water from them more quickly.</p>

<p>Fans are much less expensive to operate than dehumidifiers and heaters.  Put the clothes in an area where you can move air into and back out of the room.  If you have two windows in the drying room, that would be best - have one fan pulling air into the room via one window, and the other fan blowing air out of the room via the other window.</p>

<p>If you only have one window, pull air from the door into the room, and then blow it out the window.</p>

<p>If your room doesn't have two openings to increase the airflow, set up an oscillating fan near the one opening that alternately blows air out of the room and pulls air into the room. </p>

<p>Alternately, if you have forced air heating/cooling, you can turn the fan of that system on and it will circulate the air through the room into the rest of the house, where you can ventilate the more humid air outside.</p>

"How to prevent HDMI cable from coming loose","6257","","<p>I currently have my laptop hooked up to an LG 22LS4D TV screen which I use for programming.

<strong>How would I be able to make sure my HDMI cable disconnect less often?</strong>. </p>

"How do I prevent/fix holes in the front pockets of my jeans?","6226","","<p><sub>If you have already seen <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/1673/is-there-any-way-to-fill-in-a-hole-in-my-shoe-so-it-is-waterproof"">my other question regarding clothing</a> you may think I look like a bum. But I actually don't and I also don't care what you're thinking.</sub></p>

<p>The problem is that I get a hole in the front pocket of my fairly new jeans. The fabric wears off on the inside of the pocket, the one touching my thigh, until there's a hole. This doesn't bother me to much, because I'm always carrying my <strong>wallet and my keys</strong> in that pocket (the keys are on the outer side, so the wallet prevents the keys from getting tangled in the hole/worn off fabric but it still rather seldom happens). But when it happens it's really annoying! I'm trying to unlock a door and start to pull on my keychain (picture below), which is connected to the belt loop of the jeans with a carabineer, but the keys are tangled in the hole/worn off fabric and I need to reach into the pocket and untangle the keys.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aOlv0m.jpg"" alt=""keychain""></p>

<p>It only happened with that pocket (the left one - if that really matters) and I'm guessing because of the sharp edges of the keys - I actually don't want to change the habit of carrying my wallet and keys in the left, and my cellphone in the right pocket. But if it's the only solution I'll have to.</p>

<p>With one pair of jeans, I've already tried to replace the whole pocket with an old kitchen cloth. It seemed to work, but washing once already resulted in a hole at the bottom of the pocket, where the seam is.</p>

<p>My jeans really are not that old and I don't have holes in other parts of the jeans, so I don't want to throw them away, just because there's a hole in the pocket.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a reason for these holes, which I didn't mention?</li>
<li>Is there any way to prevent worn off fabric in jeans pockets (make fabric stronger/""protect"" sharp edges of keys)?</li>
<li>How do I properly replace/fix a jeans pocket which has a hole in it?</li>
</ul>
","<h3>Repair</h3>

<p>Front pockets of trousers are usually made of soft fabric that will be much less resistant to mechanical strain.</p>

<p>There are two instances the pockets get holes:</p>

<p><strong>1. The fabric becomes worn out</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We then have to either sew in a patch, hoping it will hold for another few months. There are also patches to apply with an iron but they usually won't last too long to my experience.</li>
<li>Replace the whole pocket with a new one (preferably with a better fabric quality). This will involve quite some knowledge in sewing, hence I let somebody else do that for me.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. The seam gets loose</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This can mostly be fixed easily by just stitching it on again</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prevention</h3>

<p>The obvious thing to prevent this from happening is to keep all sharp edged things out of our pockets. This is true for coins, keys, lighters, swiss army knifes or other stuff real men love to carry close to their legs.</p>

<p>Now being a real man, I can't think of a life without all these items im my pockets. Therefore I came to the conclusion I need to put my keys into a special bag or pouch. This could be anything from a <strong>small self-made linen pouch</strong></p>

"How can I avoid sweating while sleeping?","6165","","<p>Lately I wake up sweating. Sometimes I have to wake up very early and I don't like to always have to take a shower in the morning.</p>

<p>I tried the obvious solution which is sleeping with less clothes but if I do that I'm cold before falling asleep and it's much more difficult for me to do so.</p>

<p><strong>How can I avoid sweating while sleeping?</strong></p>
","<p>As others have pointed out, some amount of sweating is normal, and you don't want to get too cold in your sleep. It sounds like you're saying that you're sweating excessively while you sleep and this is a recent change. Here are three things you can do to keep from overheating while you sleep:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use blankets made from breathable material. Often when we sweat it is because the air around us isn't circulating. Have you ever seen a movie where someone wanted to lose some water weight quickly so they wore a garbage bag so they'd sweat it off? If you're using sheets or blankets that don't breathe then that's what you're doing to yourself at night.</li>
</ol>

<p>Materials that don't breathe are typically synthetic materials. For example a blanket made out of any of these materials most likely doesn't breathe: fleece, polyester, microflannel. Materials that breathe are typically natural materials like cotton, wool, silk, and down.</p>

<p>If your sheets, blanket or bedspread are made from synthetic materials that don't breathe then that's the most likely culprit. Try swapping them out with all cotton sheets and a wool blanket. Or, the best solution for cold climates, use 100% cotton sheets with a quality down duvet.</p>

<p>A note on getting a quality down duvet: You want a down duvet that contains mostly down and only a few feathers. It is the down that breathes and maintains your body temperature so well. Feathers are often used in duvets as filler. A duvet that contains a lot of feathers won't be much better than a cheap synthetic blanket. To get the breatheability and comfort benefits from down you need a high quality duvet that is filled 90% to 95% with down and only 10% to 5% with feathers. Even the highest priced duvets sold at places like Sears, Bed Bath and Beyond, Walmart, and Cotsco most likely do not fit this bill. How do you know if the duvet contains 90% to 95% down? Most duvets available at mainstream stores in the United States do not. If the manufacturer does not advertise that the duvet contains 90% - 95% down, then it doesn't. You'll need to search the internet and learn what makes a good duvet, so you'll know what to look for in a duvet and where you can find them.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of links to get you started. The information on this website is excellent. Unfortunately the owner has retired and they no longer sell duvets, so you'll have to find another duvet maker who makes quality duvets. Fortunately their website is still up and the down duvet information is still accessible. If you can find another maker who makes duvets as good as this place, then you're all set:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.featherfactory.com/downfacts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Down Facts</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.featherfactory.com/custduv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Duvet Information</a></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Sleep in clothes made from breathable material: The same factors that apply to your bed sheets and blankets also apply to the clothes you wear while you sleep. Avoid synthetic materials that don't breathe; Wear clothes made only from breathable fibers. Cotton, wool, and silk are excellent material for clothes you're going to wear to sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>What you're eating or drinking before bed, or earlier in the day, could be affecting your metabolism and causing you to get hot at night. For example alcohol, wheat, milk, or caffeine can make some people overheat while they sleep. Investigate on the internet and conduct your own experiments by removing suspect foods from your diet temporarily to see if you notice a change. Since you mention that the sweating at night is a recent change, alcohol is a good place to start. Many people find that alcohol affects their sleep pattern and body temperature differently as they get older - it wakes them up in the middle of the night and/or makes them hot.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When those three things are all in order, and the temperature of the room you are sleeping in is reasonable, then you should find your body temperature comfortable throughout the night.</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong> Another variant using a measuring trick, is to first make an even roll, then use the tip of your digits(/fingers) not including the thumb to make a line of dots along the length of the roll. Then you can count the dots and divide by three.</p>

"How can I keep glasses free of fogging from my breath, when wearing ski mask in cold weather?","5879","","<p>How can I keep glasses free of fogging from my breath, when wearing ski mask in cold weather?</p>

<p>The problem is that, when breathing out, the hot wet breath gets channeled by the mask upwards - both around the sides of the nose inside the mask; and along the mask surface on the outside; and both paths meet cold glasses resulting in immediate fogging when the water from the breath condenses on the cold surface.</p>

<h1>Constraints:</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>The glasses are NOT optional - neither taking them off completely, nor wearing contacts, is possible. </p></li>

And once standing at traffic lights, the wind which usually blows away the wet breath is gone and glasses tend to fog immediately). I didn't find a way to keep the nose covered. i.e. use a ski mask designed to cover mouth and nose which is a bit generous in the size of the eye whole and pull the lower rim under your nose. Otherwise you'll always have small gaps next to your nose which perfectly channel the air upwards.</p>

<p>Second ingredient is train to breath in the right direction. Sounds pretty dull, and is annyoing in the beginning, sorry for that. Anyway, depending on what your ""neutral jaw position"" is (assuming mouth breathing) your exhaust air goes horizontally or slightly upwards or slightly downwards. Try to find a comfortable new neutral position, slightly more opened, the jaw slightly more back and you don't fog your glasses. (really really not much, just a slightly different neutral position. No force, nothing uncomfortable. The annoying thing is that it takes concentration in the beginning because a single breath in upwards and your glasses are white).</p>

<p>Leaving the field of ski masks, these stiff neoprene face masks for mountainbiking (<a href=""http://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_384027_1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">these</a> were the first i found on google) are worth considering. Also worn lower than intended by the manufacturer! I use them as a ""stiff scarf"" protecting the lower face from wind, due to its stiffness it cannot slip down even if you move your head in all directions. Eventually I switched to those and keep the skimask for really really cold days. Crucial aspect: not the neutral looking soft ones which are sold for winter cycling, but the stiff ones with drawings to look badass … preposterous, I know, but if the manufacturers don't get the target groups right, what can I do</p>

"What is the best way to tape a cardboard box?","5751","","<p>While moving recently, my wife and I had a lengthy discussion on where tape should be placed on a box in order to maximize strength while using the least amount of tape possible. Assuming we already taped the main opening of the box shut, how can we make sure the box doesn't break open with weighty items inside?</p>

<p>To me, it doesn't make sense to put tape perpendicular across the opening of a box, detailed below.</p>

<pre><code>(Top/bottom of a closed box)

<p>What's the best way to tape a box closed to maximize the strength of the box relative to the amount of tape being used? (May not necessarily be one of the options described above.)</p>
","<p>How to <strong><em>securely</em></strong> seal a cardboard box with tape</p>

<p>Before you put anything into a cardboard box, you should tape up the bottom of the box. If you don’t, and only fold the bottom of the box flaps over each other, the box could collapse when lifted. You don’t want your best china in pieces all over the floor!</p>

<p>TIP: Never interlock the flaps of the box as it reduces the strength of the box.<br/></p>

<p>TIP: <em>Optional</em> The quickest and easiest way to seal a cardboard box is to use a handheld tape dispenser which applies the tape tightly to the box and helps reduce tape waste.<br/></p>

<p>To provide extra protection and ensure all the flaps of the box are sealed, use the letter “H” seal method used by most moving companies.  It is called the letter “H” method as once complete, the tape on the box will look like a capital letter “H”.</p>

<p>TIP: The “H” seal method will also reveal any evidence of tampering with the box because of the quantity of tape that would have to be removed.</p>

<ol>
<li>Fold two of the smaller box flaps in followed by the two larger
ones.</li>
<li>Seal the edges of the cardboard box going across the whole length of
the box where the flap edges join.  When doing this, allow an
overhang of tape.  Fold the overhang of tape to the side of the
cardboard box.</li>
<li>Seal the edges of the cardboard box going across the whole length of
either side of the box where the flaps were closed. When doing this
allow an overhang of tape. Fold the overhang of tape to the side of
the cardboard box.</li>
<li>Pack the box. Ensure the contents are adequately protected by using
bubble wrap, polythene, loose fill, or air-cushion packaging.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3, above, to seal the top of the box.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Once complete, your cardboard box will be sealed on all openings and the tape will resemble the letter “H” on the top and bottom of the box. This method will provide optimal support for the box contents.</p>

<p> It’s always better to use extra tape and provide a double layer if you are boxing very heavy items.</p>

Because they're so durable, I want to be able to use them for other things. <strong>How can I undo a plastic cable tie so that it is still usable?</strong></p>

<p>In case you don't know what a cable tie is:</p>

<p>If you get something <strong>small and pointy</strong> <em>(a pin or needle but other small objects will work)</em> and put into the block with this tab and try to pull it down with the object you are using and then it should undo very easily!</p>

<p>I found a <a href=""http://bretcontreras.com/a-simple-technique-for-beating-blisters/"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> where they also explain the process, but I'll sum it up here just in case.</p>

<p>You'll need:</p>

<pre><code>1 Sewing needle
Some white thread (no color threads as they contain dyes)
Betadine
Band-Aid(s)
1 Sterile gauze (or moleskin)
A pair of small scissors
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Take a needle and put a thread through it.</li>
<li>Soak both in betadine for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li>Go through your blister with the needle, so it will leave two holes with thread emerging from both. The fluid will drain out of the
blister.</li>
<li>Separate the thread from the needle, leaving it inside the blister. Move it back and forth to soak the inside of the blister with
betadine, but be careful to keep the blister intact.</li>
<li>Cut some thread from each side until there's a little less than 2cm outside each side of the blister.</li>
<li><p>Cover the blister with a Band-Aid and avoid getting the area wet for at least 24h.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, if you have to train the next day, also put a gauze instead of the band-aid. It will prevent some of the rubbing and also soak any liquid it may come out during training. You can also use moleskin. I've been said it's better than gauze, so feel free to try it.</p></li>
<li>After 24h, the blister should be mostly cured and given the case the thread should be
removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have in mind this method could also help curing hand-blisters. But the blister should be intact before we apply it (And after).</p>

","<p>American paper currency is very resilient. In fact, one of the tests that they do when designing new bills is to run them through a full wash/dry cycle, and then repeat over and again. Another is where they crumple and straighten the bill hundreds of times in an automated machine. I tried to find the documentary I once watched regarding the impressive battery of tests that bills go through, but I can't seem to find it now.</p>

<p>Also, paper currency from most parts of the world can survive at least a few wash/dry cycles without fading. Simply stuff the bills in with your laundry, perhaps inside a sock that's tied up, and throw it in with color-safe detergent, fabric softener, on a cold/cold wash (cold wash, cold rinse), and it should get out almost any stains you can imagine, least of all pet urine. You can do that wash with all your other colors, although avoid doing so with freshly purchased red clothing, as it will cause your sock and the bills to be tinted red quite permanently.</p>

<p>Finally, simply run it through a normal dryer cycle where your clothes get nice and dry. I personally use automatic drying cycles, which tend to take longer, but leave my clothing soft and nicely toasty.

","<p>In my experience, brushes are better for ""maintenance shining"", where you just want a quick touch-up. For a high shine, I've always found a rag to be more effective.</p>

<p>You can use just about any soft, lint-free cloth, but my favorite was old t-shirts. Polish with a back-and-forth motion of the cloth at high speed.</p>

<p>In addition, once you have it <em>mostly</em> done, using a bit of water helps give it a nice glossy coat. Normally I'd just dampen the cloth/rag a bit and keep the same polishing motion as before.</p>

<p>This is how I was taught to do it upon joining the military, and I haven't found a more reliable way since.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, if you just want a ""cheater"" shine, use a bit of oil (cooking oil is fine) instead of water. Just a touch, though. This will add an impressive shine, but it won't last long. After a few hours, it will start collecting dust and look terrible until reshined. It's useful if you only wear these shoes once in a great while, for short periods.</p>

"How to tell if surface is level","5020","","<p>I'm renting a room and the floor is not very even. I plan on wedging some cardboard/cloth/felt sticky pads beneath some surfaces (such as my chair and bed).</p>

<p>The first step is to test in which direction the object is lowest. I don't own a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Levels/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=553256"" rel=""nofollow"">level</a>. I've heard of putting a marble on the surface and seeing which direction it rolls, but I don't have any marbles either.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I was about to say I didn't have any wood, but there's some houses being built close to me and the workers said I could take a plank.</p>
","<p>I'll give you two options for making a level of your own. Both are based on the simple fact that water is level, and will keep being level even going through a hose.</p>

<h2>Level based on glass of water</h2>

<p>The most rudimentary level you can have is a single container of water, and just watch the level of the water. This can be a glass bowl, or as simple as a single glass. If you combine this with a straight piece of wood, you have a rudimentary level.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dbWjb.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dbWjbm.png"" alt=""Glass of water on top of plank""></a></p>

<p>This can give you an accuracy of centimeters or parts of an inch, if used carefully. And the combination of a 3' / 1m piece of wood and glass, can be used together to measure if different furniture are reasonably level. You could even use the water glass / glass bowl directly on the furniture to verify that it is reasonably level.</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong> A variation of this, requiring a little balance act, is to use two glasses one at each end of the plank. And then you can visually align this to get a sense on how unlevel it is.</p>

<h2>Level based on bottles and a hose</h2>

<p>A much better level requires a little more equipment: two clear bottles, a hose and some tape to join it all together. The base setup is like in the image below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6oPHj.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6oPHjm.png"" alt=""Two bottles connected through a hose with water""></a></p>

<p>To make this you cut off the bottom of the two bottles, and join them to the hose using tape. Fill up from one end until you have water appearing in both of the bottles.</p>

<p>This arrangement will have the water stabilising at the same level. If you have a few friends helping you, you can measure distance from the water level to your floor and decide what is level.</p>

<p>Another option using this level is to use it close to the wall, and mark on the wall (i.e. using tape which can be removed afterwards) where it is level, and then measure out the floor at different points.</p>

<p>Or you could use a tripod and fasten one bottle, measure the distance down to the floor, and then move the other bottle around and measure the difference of distance to the floor on different locations.</p>

<h3>Added: Extended usage example</h3>

<p>First of as Zaaikort indicates, you can also use a (semi-)transparent hose without the bottles as the level. In my experience though, it is a little easier with the bottles.</p>

<p>One way to 'calibrate' the system is that you attach one bottle (or that hose end) to a chair (or stick) and make a mark on the bottle at the water level. Hold the other bottle next to it and make the mark at the other bottle as well. Make a note of the length down to the floor from the water level.</p>

<p>When you now move the loose bottle around in the room, you can measure the distance from the water level and down to the floor. If it is not the same as the original distance (from the chair/stick) to the floor, you are not level and you can subtract the two values to see how much it is off. </p>

"Can I use carpet underlay for the purpose of making a rug thicker?","4934","","<p>I have a rub in the middle of the living room, I would like to make it thicker so it does not hurt when the children fall on it while playing. Someone advised me to but a suitable size of carpet underlay.</p>

<p>I know very little about these things but Google and Youtube search results shows that carpet underlay is something that we use for a totally different situation.</p>

<p>Was the advice I got realistic? What other alternatives do I have?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QOxos.jpg"" alt=""rug""></p>
","<p>If you are looking for something to make the carpet thicker, thus making it softer for children, an underlayment is not what you need.  </p>

<p>An underlayment is a thin foam sheet that is typically used underneath wood flooring.  What you are going to need to look for is a rug pad.  If you go to your local home improvement store and ask their flooring department, they will show you the difference in the two products.  The underlayment comes in long rolls and is a thin foam material; whereas carpet padding is typically sold in pre-measured square foot sections (ie. 6'x8' section) or some stores may custom cut a pad for you if you would like them to (this could cost you a little more).  The carpet padding comes in lots of different sizes and lots of different thicknesses, so you can determine what is best for your family.  </p>

<p>If you are unsure of these two options, you can research the two terms on the home depot website; it will give you more clarity on both products.  </p>

<p>I have used carpet padding, and it makes quite a difference in the softness of the rug.  I will also tell you that @lefty is absolutely correct in that you need to use some type of carpet tape or adhesive to adhere the carpet padding to the rug.  Some padding has one side with a rubber grip on it, and this is the side you put on the floor to keep it in place.  If it does not, use the carpet tape on the padding as well to adhere it to the floor so that it does not move around while your kids are playing on the carpet - otherwise it will happen, and they will fall; it happened to my daughter, and then we went out and bought 2 rolls of carpet tape.</p>

"How to avoid/stop pressurised ballpoint pen leaking?","4609","","<p>I bought a Fisher Space Pen with a PR4 black medium cartridge some months ago. It's been leaking for some time, and seems to be getting worse - every time I use it I have to clean off the tip or get big splotches on the paper which take a long time to dry. It <em>seems</em> the leakage is actually not at the tip but at the seam between the blank tip and the copper-coloured main part of the cartridge. I carry the pen in a trouser pocket and live in a temperate climate, so I guess the temperature of the pen could get up to almost body temperature and down to night-time room temperatures (10-15°C) daily. Are there any tricks to avoid or stop leakage in such cartridges?</p>
","<p>I don't know how hack-y this is, but leaking is not a normal part of the wear and tear of this pen; it is a manufacturer's defect. You should send it back to the manufacture. Fisher Space Pens are warrantied against any malfunction basically forever.</p>

","<p>I tend to find that I need to do something else to the afflicted area to relieve / or distract me from the itchiness.</p>

<p>A couple of things that I have done before with varying success are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apply cold to the area</strong> - Just rubbing over a cool glass or chilled drinks can can do wonders to relieving the itching sensation</li>
<li><strong>Inflict pain on or around the area</strong> - This can vary from a firm slap to me stabbing it with something sharp like a pen or pencil <em>(I'm not a sadist or anything, only do it if you're comfortable and don't do any serious damage to yourself)</em></li>
<li><strong>Bathe the area in warm or cold water</strong> - I sometimes get really itchy eyes so opt for putting them under running cold water to try and relieve some of the irritation. Experiment with both cold and warm water to see what works for you best</li>
<li><strong>Cover the area</strong> - If you are unable to stop the urge to scratch, then you can just employ a physical barrier to completely stop you from <em>being able to</em> scratch. Unless of course you just remove said barrier to get the itchy goodness but then you must really love to scratch</li>
<li><strong>Put pressure on it</strong> - Sometimes I just find the most simple thing is to put a deal of pressure on it either by sitting on <em>(if possible)</em> or laying on it. This is usually the most effective for me personally so it might work for you too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just as an extra note - if it is the lotion that is causing the itchiness you might have an allergy to it or something so I would suggest trying a <strong>different brand or product</strong>. Just something to think about as it could remove the problem all together!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shoe odor is actually caused by the feet, namely, the bacteria that live on human skin. These bacteria in the sweat produced by humans are part of the body’s cooling mechanism. </p>

<p>If you are in a tropical or warm country then this will occur to you most of the time, especially if you are doing much physical activity (e.g. exercising, running, etc.). If this is your case then you can do this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Applying antibacterials to the feet before putting on a pair of shoes can also help kill the bacteria that are on the feet. This is an option for those with particularly bad foot odor or those who are heavy sweaters.</p>

Or undo one end of the line and put it through a sleeve, and out the neck, or through a sleeve, across the body of the shirt and out the other sleeve (works for Tshirts as well as button shirts.) These things won't help you with your ""smalls"" but might let you conserve a limited number of pegs to use for those things that really need them.</p>

"How to clean food coloring off skin?","4094","","<p>With the holidays coming up, I decided to do some baking.  The recipes asked for food coloring to be used in the dough. This means the color was kneaded into it and I failed to wear gloves. As a result, my hands are now colored with spots of red and green.  </p>

<p>I've tried soaking them in warm water and washing with soap, but my skin is still stained.</p>

"How can I clear my shower drain without drain cleaner?","4004","","<p>While showering I notice that the drain starts to clog and water start to accumulate, but yet its not totally clogged. What can I do to prevent further clogging, while still being able to continue my shower?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUqCRm.jpg"" alt=""Original uploader was Alexander.stohr at de.wikipedia Later versions were uploaded by Wiska Bodo, Austriaboss, Wikipeder at de.wikipedia""></p>

<p>I have a separate shower that happens to have a drain that clogs easily. I try to remember to put drain cleaner into it regularly but I sometimes forget. Also the shower gets used by people with long hair.</p>

<p>I've tried holding the shower head directly to the drain, but that did not change anything. I tried adding soap and shampoo but that did not work either.</p>

<p>I don't have drain cleaner currently and can't go buy some in the next days as the shops are closed where I am, so the drain needs to be open for the next few days (~5 showers).</p>
","<p>There are multiple steps that help in this case:</p>

<ol>
<li>Next time, comb your hair before taking a shower. That is especially helpful for people with long hair. This will cause your loose hair to be in the brush instead of the drain and thus reduce clogging.</li>
<li>When the clogging starts, stop adding water ASAP and then try to remove everything from the drain that you can reach. Hair, especially, likes to hang on various parts of the drain that can be reached by hand. If available, use a hairclip, bend it to a hook shape and clean the drain with it as much as possible.</li>
<li>Use a ""poor man's <a href=""https://www.google.de/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1778&amp;bih=959&amp;q=P%C3%B6mpel&amp;oq=P%C3%B6mpel&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l5j0i10j0l2j0i10i24j0i24.1684.3194.0.4570.6.6.0.0.0.0.154.446.5j1.6.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.60.img..0.6.443.v8vPzVz3ZPU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pömpel</a> (AKA plunger)"": fill some water into the shower while keeping the drain covered with your palm. Then quickly raise your hand and smash it onto the drain opening, repeatedly. Do it <strong>fast</strong>, do it <strong>often</strong>, do it <strong>hard</strong>. That will cause the water in the drain to move back and forth and take with it any stuff that currently is stuck in the drain. Its important to apply this after #2 has been completed as throughly as possible so the clogging is not attached to something as durable as hair in the drain. (Of course, if you happen to own a Pömpel/plunger, use that.)</li>
</ol>

<p>PS: After attempting <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/a/2086/129"">Andrew's Answer</a> I had to open the drainage system below my shower (I was lucky to be able to do that) I found out that my shower had a build in plunger system that had been blocked by hair and dirt. Most likely even before I moved in the flat (the hair did not have a color one of the regular uses has). So, before attempting his or mine solution pay close attention to your drainage system and inspect it closely (A play <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1778&amp;bih=959&amp;q=dental%20mirror&amp;oq=dental%20mirror&amp;gs_l=img.3...2030.5997.0.6300.13.10.0.3.0.0.78.503.9.9.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.60.img..5.8.456.TPvTbNo0SvI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dental mirror</a> from my daughters ""doctor set"" was useful).

"How do I trim my facial hair symmetrically and the same every time","3969","","<p><strong>First off, this isn't about trimming techniques or Dos and Don'ts.</strong>
I use a similar <em>electric trimmer</em> to the one the OP posted in the following question: <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/1806/what-to-do-if-your-shaver-broke-halfway-through-shaving/1829#1829"">What to do if your shaver broke halfway through shaving?</a>
I also already follow the rules mentioned in the top-answer of the above question.</p>

<p>I don't have a beard, and I don't shave close. That's why I used the term facial hair. I have a certain facial hair style I want to accomplish every time I trim my facial hair again.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/P7oiMm.jpg"" alt=""quick sketch of my personal style""></p>

<p>So I actually have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I trim my facial hair symmetrically?</li>
<li>How do I achieve the same facial hair style every time I trim?</li>
</ol>

<p>To trim symmetrically I just use my good eye and move my head from left to right and trim here and there, until I find it symmetrically.</p>

<p>If my last trimming-session isn't that long ago, I can still see where the hair is shorter; I see the trimming-lines and try to follow them again. But if I trimmed a long time ago, I can't recognize where I trimmed last time.</p>

<p>I thought about something like a template. But what would that be made of and where could it be fixed?</p>

<p>I hope I'm not the only one bothered by this.</p>
","<p>One way to accomplish this is to buy some window cling inkjet paper, then take two photographs of your face.  One head on, and one from the side (pick the side that's looking better).  Cut the head on face in half, and mirror one side of it to the other. Also take the one side photo and mirror it.  You should have three images - one head on, and one right, and one left.  All of them should only have original imagery from one side of the face, though, due to the mirroring.  Expect them to look/feel strange - your brain recognizes your face very well, and when presented with an altered face it'll notice and tell you something is wrong.  Ignore that.</p>

<p>Print these out a little bit smaller than life size onto the window cling inkjet paper, and place them on your mirror at a comfortable height.  You should now be able to look at yourself through the window cling from the front and both sides.  Even with full color, you should be able to see your face through the window cling, but depending on the cling, printer, and images this might be difficult - adjust the image transparency or brightness and try again.  You'll also have to adjust the size a little bit.  Since your mirror self is in the distance and visually smaller, the printout will need to be slightly smaller than life size, but not by much.  </p>

<p>Now you should be able to very closely attain a consistent, symmetrical look.</p>

<p>Warning: Most faces aren't perfectly symmetrical.  Don't blame me if you find out that one ear is slightly higher than the other, or that your eyes aren't exactly perpendicular to your nose/mouth.  If this does turn out to be a problem, then make it as symmetrical as you can, then take three pictures without using any mirroring.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dave -   In some senses, it doesn’t actually stop it steaming up. 
  Steam is lots of little droplets of water.  When the light hits it,
  the light gets bent and so you get a very distorted image which, when
  you move away from it, just looks like a kind of mist.  What the
  shaving foam does: there are lots of detergents in it and those
  detergents reduce the surface tension of the film of water so it
  doesn’t form lots of little droplets.  It just forms a big flat sheet
  that you can see through much better, so you can see through it even
  though the water is still condensing.</p>
  
  <p>Ben -   So there’s literally the same amount of water there; it’s just
  a change in the structure of the water.  So why do the droplets make
  it so hard to see things?</p>
  
  <p>Dave -   Because water has quite a high refractive index - when light
  hits it, it bends.  If it hits this curved surface of a droplet, each
  one basically acts as a little tiny lens, light is bounced off in all
  sorts of different directions and makes it looks essentially white. 
  This breaks up the image and makes it look misty.</p>

"Stop keyboard wobble due to uneven desk","3773","","<p>I've just acquired and finished setting up a new wooden plank computer desk.

<p><strong>What simple solutions could I implement to my keyboard to stop this from happening? I'd like to keep the solution's visibility minimal.</strong> </p>

<p>I've contemplated using <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CFUgj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sticky Tack</a> to level the keyboard but the thought of seeing a blue blob on the bottom of my keyboard daily does not blend well with my OCD.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/joPQF.gif"" alt=""animated keyboard wobble""></p>
","<p>This is happening because there is a gap of space between a corner of your keyboard and the desk.</p>

<p>Your goal, as you may have guessed, is to remove this gap.</p>

<ul>
<li>Small.</li>
<li>As thick as the gap.</li>
<li>Solid at room temperature, occupying a region of the known universe's three spacial dimensions. Ideally low enough density that its mass does not exert a significant gravitational pull on surrounding objects.</li>
<li>Non-toxic through skin contact. Non-toxic to any pets you may have.</li>
<li>Stable (non-radioactive), inert (non-reactive, at least with your desk, keyboard, and air), and either non-magnetic or possessing a magnetic field with an intensity low enough to not damage nearby sensitive objects.</li>
<li>Composed of little or no saccharides (sugars), proteins, and/or lipids (fats), which may attract ants (relevant to me, at least), roaches, or other pests. (Example: Do not affix a small piece of meat to your keyboard with honey.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes you may look around you and find something that is the appropriate thickness but perhaps too large. If you find materials like this, look for one that you can cut with a tool. Examples of tools that cut things are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scissors.</li>
<li>Knives.</li>
<li>Generally anything harder than the material you wish to cut with a wedge-shaped edge that can be driven into the material to separate it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some materials can even be torn by hand.</p>

<p>Another option is something larger but soft, so that it can deform to an even surface. Many such things exist. Things like mouse pads, placemats, pieces of random soft material that you may have laying around or see online. Using imagination and your lifetime's worth of experience with physics, you should be able to find such a material.</p>

<p>Once you find this material, insert it into the gap or under the keyboard.</p>

<p>""But wait!"" you say, ""Every time I move my keyboard, the material slips out!"" Well, as you may have noticed throughout your life, the problem of preventing one thing from moving relative to another thing has many established solutions. Your goal is to find some sort of material or compound that will allow your chosen gap filler to remain in place relative to the desk or keyboard. For inspiration, your local dollar store's school supply section or local hardware store's adhesive section may be of use.</p>

<p>Some materials may not even need to be cut, and may fit all of the above requirements. For example, using my power of logical thinking, and remembering things that I have seen before, I am able to recall that <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=sticky%20rubber%20feet"">these are possible options</a>. Perhaps you have some laying around that you haven't used. </p>

<p>Of course, the ""best"" (that is, it'll <em>really</em> solve the issue) option is to level your desk, for which tools such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBRmwT7hNcw"">hand planes</a> exist (if you find the video unsatisfying, there are others in the related video list), as leveling uneven wood is also a problem with well-established solutions. If the desk already has a finish, though, you'd have to refinish it. Still, a job well done can be fun and satisfying.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you purchased the desk new, and it is warped, consider exchanging it for one that is not warped.</p>

"How do I avoid wrinkles in dress pants placed on a hanger?","3761","","<p>I am constantly using dress pants for work or other events. I iron these pants in advance, and sometimes, they ended up with a wrinkle because of the hanger's curvature. Is there any type of hack that I can use, so I can hang the pants in a way that the curvature of the hanger does not create a wrinkle?</p>

<p>Not a hack, but they make <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=pants%20hanger&amp;espv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_xakVNWOI4WfggT-roSIDQ&amp;ved=0CF0QsAQ&amp;biw=1455&amp;bih=705"" rel=""noreferrer"">hangers designed for this</a>. Assuming your closet is tall enough, you can just let them hang down fully without the fold. If you don't want to buy one, you can fashion one yourself out of a regular hangar and a couple clothespins. The idea is to just clip the waist to the hangar.</p>

<h3>Option 2: Duct tape</h3>

<p>The main reason you get a crease is because the hangar is too thin, and it's creating a fold. You can thicken it by wrapping it in something. Sure you could use cloth or something else, but duct tape is normally on hand (at least in my experience). Try to wrap it as smoothly as possible. If you can get the hangar bar to a half-inch or more diameter, you shouldn't have much of a problem with wrinkles.</p>

"How can I tell if an egg has gone bad without cracking it open?","3666","","<p>Like anyone on the planet, I hate the smell of rotten eggs. How can I tell if an egg is bad without cracking it open?</p>

<p>So far all I have tried is simply cracking it open and then throwing away the egg if it is bad, but that creates a bad smell and is a waste - I might be able to use some for cooking that I would otherwise throw away.</p>
","<p>I place the egg in a glass of water.</p>

<p>If it floats, it is bad. If it stands up, use it for cooking (e.g. a hard boiled egg but not soft), it's getting old. If it sinks, you're safe.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The outer shell of an egg has two membranes under it. When an egg is laid, it is warm and starts cooling which contracts the inner part of the egg more than the shell and pulls the two membranes apart. As a result, air gets trapped in between the membranes (there is not enough air initially for it to float).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><a href=""http://awesci.com/why-do-bad-eggs-float/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a></sup></p>

<p>As this egg gets older, air is taken in (due to slightly higher pressure from the contractions) through pores in the egg. Eventually, bacteria will get in too. When the egg has enough air to float, it's probably gone bad with the bacteria.</p>

"How to avoid butt-dials on phones where the keypad is always exposed?","3609","","<p>My phone just loves to butt-dial. In the ~6 months I have owned it, I've made about 10 butt-dials, 2 of which were emergency phone calls. Naturally, I don't want to clog their services.

"How to get Urine stains out of carpet","3339","","<p>I recently got a puppy, and he is still not quite house trained. I attempt to clean up his accidents right away, but they still leave a small stain. I can see small circles on the carpet where he has urinated.</p>

<p>What is a good way to get the urine stains out of the carpet?</p>

<p>I haven't really used any methods yet, and I am too cheap for a carpet cleaner. I originally used vinegar to clean up the spots because i've heard it counteracts the urine smell. So short of vinegar, I haven't tried anything else.</p>
","<p><strong>Things I use:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Substitute Vinegar with Ammonia. Using ammonia requires vigorous rubbing and possibly a scrub brush, but if you clean 2 to 3 times with this method the smell goes. Also, try substituting with dish washing liquid, the good smell can help get rid of the odour and do some deep cleaning. Make sure you add water or a residue may build up.</p>

<ul>
<li>Substituting with lemon juice works to, but can leave a stickyness unless you rinse with water or water down adequately. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mixing regular soap with baking soda helps with the odour and the mess. </p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Pet-Urine-from-Carpet#Using_Other_Remedies_sub"">Hydrogen Peroxide and water.</a> </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start by dusting the stain with a thin coat of baking soda, then mix
  up about a cup of hydrogen peroxide with a tablespoon of dish soap in
  a spray bottle. Mix gently to combine. Then, saturate the baking soda
  and the stain thoroughly. Use an old toothbrush or your fingers to
  massage the mixture gently into the carpet, then let the mixture sit
  until it dries. Vacuum up the mess and clean it again with cool
  water.<a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Pet-Urine-from-Carpet#Using_Other_Remedies_sub"">3</a> Hydrogen peroxide can damage some kinds of carpet, making it
  important that you spot test this mixture in an out-of-the-way area of
  the carpet to make sure that it won't stain the carpet irreparably.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Apply pressure with books or a container to help with moisture wicking. Wicking the urine up is the first step in all methods and know what will damage your floor. Wet and dry vacuums help with moisture control</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Dogs like sniffing before they go know what your dog is allergic to and spray down some odours.
<ul>
<li>Vinegar</li>
<li>Essential oils- peppermint, anything minty, especially if it is strong.</li>
<li>Some perfumes, as they can have a burning smell.

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before doing anything else, if the area is still wet, be sure to blot
  the urine stain with a clean towel. You can also use paper towels to
  help absorb any remaining urine. To prevent further absorption, the
  faster you do this, the better. If you have access to any kind of
  shop-vac, use it to extract any remaining urine. If you don’t have
  this tool, proceed to the next step. Take one-quarter teaspoon of
  liquid dishwashing detergent and mix it with one cup of warm water. Be
  sure to specifically use this kind, not laundry detergent or dish
  soap; these may contain bleach or lanolin.  If you have a spray
  bottle, pour the solution into it. Spray the urine stain, aiming
  directly onto the carpet. If you can extract the solution from the
  carpet using a shop-vac, this is a good next step. Otherwise, you can
  use a cotton cloth or paper towels after the solution has set into the
  stain. After rinsing the area with warm water, repeat steps 1-5, as
  long as you’re seeing the urine stain gradually fade. Last, take two
  tablespoons of ammonia and mix into a cup of water. Rinse and repeat
  until the stain has disappeared.</p>

"How to sterilize/clean a cut/abrasion without causing pain","3302","","<p>Small cuts and abrasions can be very painful to clean.  How might one clean such a wound without causing undue pain, while still effectively sterilizing it?</p>

<p>Attempts so far that <em>have</em> caused pain:</p>

<ul>
<li>soap and water</li>
<li>isopropyl alcohol</li>
<li>polysporin</li>
<li>wet wipe</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I'm describing a minor wound, nothing that would require stitches or a skin graft and I.V. antibiotics</em></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
For those of you who've never heard of it, polysporin is basically an antibacterial with some other helpful ingredients:</p>

<p><em>Medicinal Ingredients (per gram) : 10,000 units Polymyxin B (as sulfate), 500 units bacitracin zinc, 0.25 mg gramicidin and 50 mg lidocaine. Non-medicinal Ingredients (alphabetically) : butylated hydroxytoluene, cocoa butter, cotton seed oil, olive oil, petrolatum, sodium pyruvate, vitamin E.</em></p>
","<p>Wounds by nature will hurt but we should not make them hurt more than needed when trying to clean them. Any rinsage with irritating substances such as alcohol or soap not only cause pain but they will also lead to additional tissue damage.</p>

<p>In addition we should not introduce bacteria to the wound by using any non-sterile compound, including water, cloth, and our fingers.</p>

<h3>Let it bleed</h3>

<p>Bleeding is nature's way to flush out dirt and debris. So if we let our wound bleed for a while we can almost be sure that most if not all dirt was removed as well.</p>

<h3>Remove larger dirt particles</h3>

<p>Of course we may have to remove larger dirt fragmenst from abrasions or cuts. This can be done with a pair of sterile forcepts (e.g. sterilized with a lighter flame) or a sterile piece of cloth. For splinters <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/5632/how-to-quickly-remove-a-splinter"">see this question</a>.</p>

<p>If we do not have any such tools we may use our fingers for larger particles but we'd have to be extra careful to clean them before we touch anything. Use soap and alcohol on your hands - rather than on the wound.</p>

<p>Only rinse the wound with <strong>clean (!)</strong> water in case you can't remove the dirt otherwise.</p>

<h3>Disinfect the wound</h3>

<p>It may help avoiding an infection to disinfect a wound with a disinfectant. Avoid alcohol-containing preparations, as they hurt more than help. For me a water-based <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Povidone-iodine"" rel=""nofollow"">povidone iodine</a> preparation was the least painful to apply (avoid those that also contain alcohol in their ingredients). Antibiotics should be reserved for cases where an infection had already taken place, and then you should definitely seek medical advice.</p>

<h3>Protect the wound</h3>

<p>After cleaning and applying desinfectant it is important to protect your wound from exposure to further environmental dirt. Use a clean band-aid for this. Change the bain-aid frequently.</p>

<h3>Seek medical advice</h3>

<p>Most smaller bruises are self healing over time and do not need any professional intervention but we should see a doctor in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>we are unsure about our last tetanus shot</li>
<li>the wound does not stop bleeding</li>
<li>moveability of a limb is tampered</li>
<li>numbness feeling distant to the wound</li>

"Hacking a proximity card (Oyster card) for legal use","3297","","<p>I have the equivalent of an Oyster card (proximity based public transport card). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kVpcN.jpg"" alt=""Oyster card""></p>

<p>I'm interested in having the information stored in another way so I don't have to carry around yet another card, perhaps stored on a ring or an NFC enabled smartphone. </p>

<p>Can this be done?</p>

<p>I know there are <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mclear/nfc-ring"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NFC rings</a> and you can get NFC implantable chips, but can the information be removed from the Oyster card and transferred into the ring, smartphone or implant?</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2014/09/16/contactless-card-nfc-payments-london-tube/"" rel=""nofollow"">Engadget</a> it should be able to work, as the Oyster cards seem to operate by NFC. The article also mentions the ability to use other kinds of cards and other NFC tag based trinkets (NFC sticker, NFC wristband). However, these are all issued by financial institutions, so they would reasonably contain some kind of encryption that might be hard to integrate with off the shelf NFC tags.</p>

<p>If I were you I'd try scanning an Oyster card using an NFC reader application, like <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.mroland.android.apps.nfctaginfo"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>. If you find that the card returns a fixed value for each reading, then go ahead and try to program this value into a custom NFC tag, essentially copying the card. If this new ""card"" can be used with the official Oyster readers then you are all set. However, it probably won't work, but there is still hope (see next paragraph).</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0I3KvUfKIw"" rel=""nofollow"">This video</a> suggests that the Oyster cards use some kind of security chip (Mifare Classic Smartcard Chip). This is reinforced by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE#Transportation"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> too. It seems to be possible to buy this kind of chip from <a href=""http://www.nxp.com/products/identification_and_security/smart_card_ics/mifare_smart_card_ics/"" rel=""nofollow"">this website</a>.</p>

"How to remove nail polish from nails?","3231","","<p>Many times we don't have nail polish remover around.<br>
How to remove nail polish from nails of course with no nail polish remover around?</p>
","<p>If the coat is very old, you can just scratch your nail with your fingernail or a nail file to remove it. This might damage your nail.</p>

<p>Besides nail polish remover, there are various other personal-care products that you can use to remove nail polish.</p>

<p>However, the methods to use them slightly differ. I will add the <em>method-number</em> at the end of the product.</p>

<h2>What you can use:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Spray Deodorant &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>2</em></li>
<li>Top coat nail polish &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<em>3</em></li>
<li>Nail polish you don't like &thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;<em>3</em></li>
<li>Body spray &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>1</em></li>

<li>Rubbing alcohol &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;<em>1</em>/<em>2</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3><em>1</em>: Add onto cotton and rub</h3>

<ol>
<li>Add a little of the product onto a cotton ball or the fluffy end of a q-tip (<em>Spray:</em> hold as close as possible to the nozzle to get the most of the product onto the cotton)</li>
<li>Rub the cotton ball or q-tip over your nail until the nail polish disappears</li>
</ol>

<p>You may need to dampen the cotton with some warm water so that it doesn't stick to the nail.</p>

<h3><em>2</em>: Apply directly and rub</h3>

<ol>
<li>Squirt or spray the product directly onto your nail</li>
<li>Rub your nail with a handkerchief / napkin (spray) or with your fingertip (liquid)</li>
</ol>

<h3><em>3</em>: MORE nail polish (no joke)</h3>

<ol>
<li>Apply the nail polish to your painted nail</li>
<li>Quickly get a cotton swab / ball and wipe the nail polish off</li>
<li>Repeat if necessary</li>
</ol>

<p>Cotton may stick to your nail. If the nail polish is very old, it may not work as well.</p>

<p><strong>Caution:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Using sprays will affect the air-quality. Do this outside or at least in a room with a window open or in a bathroom with a fan.</li>
<li>Whatever you do: <strong>Wash your hands afterwards</strong>. You're working with chemicals!</li>

"Cleaning Narrow Spaces in Kitchen","3208","","<p>My oven sits in between two countertops with perhaps 1/2 inch of total wiggle room, which means that I have two roughly 1/4 inch gaps that are ~36in deep in which all manner of crumbs and food mess falls on a regular basis. I'd like to clean these areas out to cut down on any food smells and potential insect issues, but I haven't come across any good solutions for doing so.</p>

<p>Anyone have any suggestions for cleaning crumbs (and potentially stuck on food) out of long but narrow gaps?</p>

<p>Edit: Someone asked about what I'd tried so far, so adding that as a note here:
My first thought was to secure a Swiffer or other dust-collecting cloth to a meter stick to make the equivalent of a narrow duster, but this was still too thick to fit inside the gap. I haven't found any other long stick-like implements that are long enough to reach in far enough while still being thin enough to meet the gap. I'm in an apartment, so I didn't see how the oven was put in and thus am hesitant to try pulling it out of place. I have, however, removed the oven's bottom storage pan and cleaned underneath it. That's helped, but I suspect there's more waiting in the wings, so to speak</p>
","<p>If you have a spare wire coat hanger handy, you could straighten it out into a long thin pole and wrap some cloth around it tightly (enough for it not to fall off, but not too much so that it doesn't fit in the gap).
Then use an in, wipe across, then out motion to get all the bits that are not reachable by hand. </p>

<p>I use this technique for cleaning down the back of my wall-mounted radiators as the gaps are too narrow for my hands. Hope this helps.</p>

"Kettle Not Whistling","3198","","<p>My old kettle rusted, so I bought a new one.  My old kettle whistled very loudly when the water reaches boiling point.  I can barely hear my new kettle whistle.  How can I amplify the whistling sound of my new kettle?</p>
","<p>The reason that kettles whistle is because of the holes in a kettle spout. Kettles usually have two plates for the spout cover. Your kettle might not have one of the plates.</p>

<p>You can fix this with a bottle cap and some common tools. First bend the bottle cap with pliers (you can also use a hammer) so that the sides are up. Now use sandpaper to get the bottle cap round. Now drill a hole in the middle of the bottle cap. You should be able to just wedge the bottle cap in the spout cover, but if you can't, you can always use glue.</p>

<p>Here's some good photos showing how to build the bottle cap cover</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone know any effective ways to remove stamps already stuck to envelopes?</strong></p>

<p>I would want the stamp to be able to be reapplied to a new letter and hence stop me from having to buy new stamps which would set me back a couple of quid.</p>

<p>I have already tried simply pulling the stamps of carefully but I always end up tearing it or making it unusable so it's no good!</p>
","<p>Cut the envelope around the stamp and then apply some liquid (water, adhesive remover or other) on the back of the envelope where the stamp is attached. let it soak for several seconds to make the adhesive dissolve a little and you will be able do remove the stamp easier without damaging it.</p>

<p>As liquid for soaking the paper some people use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adhesive remover - Heptane</li>
<li>Water - the simplest solution. Warm water works better</li>
<li>A pen with lubricant, for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/wd-40-company-WD40-26OZ-lubricants/dp/B000NV6YN8"" rel=""nofollow"">""WD-40 no mess pen""</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't mind getting the stamp wet, then simply put it in water for several seconds and the paper envelope will separate from the stamp very easily. After that let the stamp dry and you are ready. You can dry it by putting it on kitchen paper with the sticky part upwards - to avoid it sticking to the paper.</p>

<p>You can also put the stamp on transparent plastic film and let it dry on that. It will stick on it and you can cut the plastic film next to the stamp edges. Thus way you will not have problems with the sticky back of the stamp and can examine the front and the back of the stamp easily. </p>

<p>Another way to remove its stickiness is to put it in talc which will cover the back of the stamp. </p>

<p>Actually you can't use stamps for second time as they apply ink on it in the post office.</p>

<p>If your Dell laptop key is broken or missing, you have come to the right place for all resources to fix or repair your laptop keyboard key. Rather than spending hundereds of dollars on a new keyboard, you will find that replacement laptop keys is cheaper and easier to do. Here, we will give a quick tutorial on how to replace the laptop key on your Dell Latitude D610. This is a supplimental guide in addition to the video installation instructions above on you to replace your Dell Latitude D610 keyboard key: </p>

<p>Now, to install your new Dell Latitude D610 latop key, begin by orientating the retainer clip in the proper direction of the keyboard. Typically, the small plastic feet on the plastic hinge will be spaced appropriately for you to determine which direction the plastic parts go in relation to the metal hooks on the keyboard base. Observe the laptop key retainer clips carefully and notice that the smoother side will always face up, additionally, the plastic feet on the laptop keyboard key retainer clip will always face downward to allow the hinge to fit into the metal hooks. Once the retainer clip is situated correctly, lock it into the metal hooks on the keyboard base, it is always easier approaching it from one direction and hooking in the plastic clip than another. If one direction does not work, try the other. Now the laptop key retainer clip will be securely attached and ready to accept the plastic key top. If the laptop key is the type with the metal supporting bars, those will need to be inserted into the matching metal hooks as the laptop key cap slides over the plastic retainer clip and before it is pressed on. Once the keyboard key is positioned squarely over the retaining clip, press down gently until you hear a distinct click on all 4 corners. This indicates that the key cap has been secured to the retainer clip correctly. Pull up on all four corners gently to ensure that this happened correctly. That's it! You have successfully completed a repair on an individual key for the Dell Latitude D610 laptop key.</p>

Also, I have ice cream at about the same time every night (I'm an addict), so it would need to be stored for about 24 hours, and I think that a refrigerator would cause it to melt after that long.</p>

<p>The reason the ice cream goes hard is because: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>robbing your ice cream of its creaminess.
  crystals trapped inside melt. This is fine if you plan to eat your ice cream right away, but when you re-freeze partially-melted ice cream, those ice crystals re-form—but this time they're bigger and crunchier, robbing your ice cream of its creaminess.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have learned that if you use a little flour when kneeding this takes most of the stickiness away. Instead of that you could grease your hands with cooking oil, this works to make the bread not stick to your hands. Oil works better as flour can wear off faster. </p></li>

<p>Method 2: Heavy Duty Solar Oven</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut a large metal drum in half vertically with a jigsaw (e.g. oil drum).</li>
<li>Clean the inside of the half-drum thoroughly with a de-greasing soap (use a scrub brush).</li>
<li>Size and cut three pieces of sheet metal to contour to the insides of the half-drum. You need one large rectangle for the curved interior and two half-circles for the end pieces.</li>
<li>Attach the sheet metal to the inside of the drum.</li>
<li>Paint the inside of the oven with a reflective paint rated for barbecues.</li>
<li>Create a continuous metal lip around three of the four top edges of the oven. This will hold the glass top (which you will slide in and out through the fourth, open side) in place.</li>
<li>Flip the half-drum over and apply spray-on insulation to the outside walls.</li>
<li>Attach a base to the bottom of the oven (ex. a piece of wood, a square aluminium frame with wheels, etc.).</li>
<li>Drill drainage holes in the bottom of the oven. This will allow liquefied steam that drips down the sides to escape the oven.</li>
<li>Slide a custom-sized sheet of tempered glass into the metal lip.</li>
<li>Insert a magnetic thermometer.</li>
<li>Place a thin aluminium grill along the bottom (optional).</li>
<li><p>Test your oven’s heat capacity on a sunny day. Though you can reasonably expect a max heat of between 250 and 350<sup>o</sup>F (90 and 175<sup>o</sup>C) depends on the size, materials, insulation and weather. </p>

</ol>

<p>Method 3: Solar Veggie Steamer</p>

<ol>
<li>Use 2 cardboard boxes with 1 inch (2.5 cm) different dimensions, 5 cardboard panels, one vastly larger than the rest, Styrofoam, transparent wrap, aluminium foil, black craft foam, black Tupperware (with lid), water, your favourite veggie, glue, and 5 sturdy sticks.</li>
<li>Place the large box onto the large cardboard panel, glue in place. Place the smaller box inside the larger box, glue in place. Trim off any difference in height.</li>
<li>Line the empty space in between the 2 boxes with Styrofoam (don't use glue). Line the inside of the small box with 2 or 3 layers of the black craft foam, then glue together. Completely line 4 cardboard panels with the foil and glue the foil to the cardboard. Try to avoid creasing the foil.</li>
<li>Glue the panels at a 45 degree angle to the box.</li>
<li>Cut a rectangular hole just large enough to slip the Tupperware through on one side of the cooker.</li>
<li><p>Take the transparent wrap and stretch it over the entire mouth of the solar cooker.</p>

<p>It wasn't that great an idea, because it left the pages wrinkled/warped, and some stuck together.</p>
","<p>Air drying the book is probably your best bet to avoid any structural damage. Find a cool and dry room with good air circulation, and use a fan to keep the air circulating.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www2.lib.udel.edu/Preservation/wet_books.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">This description from the University of Delaware Library</a> below provides a great step-by-step.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>When a Book is Saturated</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Stand the book on its head [the top edge of the book] with absorbent paper [preferably a paper towel] beneath it</li>
  <li>Open only the covers slightly to allow the book to stand. If the book    cannot stand alone, support it with bookends.</li>
  <li>Place absorbent paper inside the front and back covers (between the    text block and covers)</li>
  <li>Do not try to separate the pages while they are very wet. Wet paper    is very weak and is likely to tear at this stage.</li>
  <li>Change the absorbent paper undeneath the book, and inside the covers,    as soon as it becomes wet</li>
  <li>Turn the book alternately to rest on its head and tail each time    paper is changed</li>
  <li>When most of the water has drained, follow the procedure for a    partially wet book</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>When a Book is Partially Wet</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Interleave absorbent paper every 20 pages or so, with the    interleaving extending beyond the head (or tail) and fore-edge</li>
  <li>NOTE: Fora damp book with coated paper, interleave between EVERY page with    waxed paper</li>
  <li>Lay the book flat</li>
  <li>Frequent changes are better than too many interleaves, which cause    further distortion (except that with coated paper, interleaving<br>
  between every page is necessary even if it causes distortion)</li>
  <li>Change the interleaving as soon as it becomes wet (depends on    conditions, so check progress at least every half hour)</li>
  <li>When books are only slightly damp, follow the procedure for damp    books</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>When a Book is Damp</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Stand a damp book on its head or tail, fanned open a little bit, and    position a fan so that the flow of air circulates into and
  around the    book.</li>
  <li>If the covers are damper than the text block, place absorbent paper    between them</li>
  <li>When almost but not completely dry, go to the final air drying step</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Final Air Drying Step</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>When almost dry, lay the book flat</li>
  <li>Place absorbent paper between covers and text block</li>
  <li>Reform the book into its normal shape if possible, and place a light    weight on top of it</li>
  <li>Do not stack drying books together. Leave the weight in place until    the book is completely dry</li>

<p>I know that you can use bike, but usually it's illegal to use it on the pavement/sidewalk.</p>

","<p>This may sound strange and childish, but I had a 1 mile walk to the subway everyday over bumpy tree root lifted sidewalk filled with other pedestrians, baby strollers etc. </p>

<p>The street was busy and the space between parked cars and moving cars was a dedicated bike lane with a large number of bikers who yelled at skateboarders.  I was always frustrated I could not increase the length of time getting to the subway without generating a sweat in my clothes.<br>
One day I saw a grown man skipping...like a kid in a playground... simply skipping to the subway. It is less then jogging, so it doesn't generate as much sweat and even with nice shoes you can do it.  Skipping doesn't require smooth sidewalks or a speed that can match or keep up with bikers.  It can also avoid other pedestrians, baby strollers etc.  </p>

<p>The only issue is its skipping and not the most manly mode of transportation.<br>
I could never bring myself to do it, but its an alternative that's faster and pretty adaptable to environments. </p>

If you have wind wings on your car, not very common these days, opening those all the way so they act as a wind scope may give you enough air to keep the fumes out. </p>

<p>If you have a vehicle able to pull a trailer, a trailer is a good way to overcome the open hatch. Trailers are often cheap to rent. However buying a small utility trailer can be an excellent option. The nice thing about buying over renting is that trailers, have a great resale value, I bought one used for 500, and sold it five years later for 500. Buying of course depends on if you have space for the trailer and how often you need a trailer.</p>

<p>A roof rack may also work well. The main limitation to a roof rack is the weight. Most passenger vehicles really are not designed to work well with roof racks. However for a few pieces of plywood or half a dozen 2x4's this may meet your needs. I would not put a roof rack on my Honda civic, but maybe a larger SUV would accommodate this just fine.</p>

<p>Another option is to make friends with someone that owns a pickup truck. You can best decide how this works for you. I know when I had a pickup truck many years ago, I would avoid making friends with people making friends because they needed a favor involving the pickup truck, unless of course she was cute.</p>

<p>The last option involves plastic sheeting and duct tape. Yes duct tape and plastic the stuff of last resort when you need to temporarily seal a space. Load your stuff and then use duct tape and plastic to seal off the back end for the drive home. Might not work very well for longer drives home that involve freeway speeds. If you have an suv/station wagon you could make the seal between the cargo department and passenger department. Should not be used when wet.</p>

<p>Another option for a cheap roof rack is stiff Styrofoam, place the load on a couple of pieces of the Styrofoam and tie down your load by running rope through the windows. Use caution and perhaps use some kind of shield between the rope and any points that it contacts the car. Please be very careful with long lumbar like 2x4 framing studs. This kind of load is very unstable, and you will find your self with a hood full of lumbar if you need to do a quick stop.</p>

<p>All of these methods involve costs. If you have a vehicle that can pull a trailer buying a used trailer is by far the most cost effective, and perhaps the most convenient. Finding a bud with a pickup may be cheaper, just depends on how much gas and beer you need to purchase. Permanent roof racks with any muscle tend to be expensive, and also reduce your gas mileage over time. Plastic and duct tape do not reuse well, and also take a lot of time.</p>

<p>Since your just getting a couple of 8 foot 2x4's, leave the tail gate shut and run them at an angle out the passengers side window, tying them off to the mirror, depending on the size of your vehicle it is typically only a foot or two that comes out the window.  </p>

"Listening to music in cubicle without headphones","2588","","<p>I work in a cubicle environment. It's okay that we wear headphones, but after wearing them all day it can get uncomfortable. In addition, occasionally I have to leave my desk and/or hear when someone approaches my cubicle and knocks.  The status quo is fine, but I'd love to have a way to modify (or get?) speakers that can be heard clearly by me at a short range (2' or closer even) without being audible to coworkers.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how I could make / get a speaker enclosure or something to accomplish this?</p>
","<p>To have speakers audible by you, and not others implies either that you have the volume turned down so that due to sound volume diminishing with distance it blends in before reaching others,  or use of active cancellation.</p>

<p>There are tons of good CPU coolers. These are just some I heard good things about. But always keep in mind to check, of course, the <em>CPU-socket compatibility</em> and the <strong>size</strong> of the cooler. If considering one that has a fan I would check it for the spinning speed and loudness (these two things are coherent: high RPM &amp; small fan = loud; low RPM &amp; big fan = quiet; low RPM &amp; small fan = not very effective but quiet; high RPM &amp; big fan = very effective, maybe still quiet). If you're checking one in an online store, reading the customer reviews tells you much about how effective it cools, how loud it is or how easy it is to install it.</p>

"How to remove tree roots","2445","","<p>Our backyard is fenced in by coniferous trees (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja"" rel=""nofollow"">Thuja</a>). Sadly enough, a few of them have died, and I want to remove them and replace them with a fence.</p>

<p>The problem however, is that these trees grow their roots deep into the ground. I could try pulling them out with a wench or heavy duty machinery, but is there also a simpler method? Removal time is not an issue.</p>
","<p><strong>My personal experience and I have not found a simple way</strong></p>

<p>I used to be some sort of teenage lumber jack(not kidding) and removing trees was the easy part, but the stump was the real pain. The trick is first kill the stump:</p>

<ol>
<li>I used a Husqvarna 450 to cut the tree down and into pieces. A 450(I think that is what it used) and larger models may be tough for you to use if you are of smaller stature(the guy that really handled it well was about 6 feet so you get the picture). </li>
<li>Now that you have a stump we would leave this for a while to rot away and become softer. But depending on your time limit there are 2 courses of action:
<ul>
<li>Wait and let it rot and then pick away at it with a pickaxe(the one I used mostly had a 8 pound head). To assist it in rotting you may use chemicals. From thisoldhouse.com:</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are several chemicals available at garden centers that will
  hasten the rotting of a tree stump. This basically involves drilling a
  series of holes in the stump and adding the chemicals.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Take the chainsaw and cut the stump around the roots. This loosens the stump now take a pickup truck or something(animals may work to) and begin to pull the stump up. Do this slowly and as the stump comes up use the chainsaw or a saw to cut the roots as they come. Make sure you brush the roots off though, because dirt can be disastrous to a chainsaw. You may want to wait a while(couple of weeks) for this method to get the best results. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>From <a href=""http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/asktoh/question/0,,213280,00.html"">thisoldhouse.com</a></strong></p>

<p>Use a fire ring: Fire rings are inexpensive and can burn the stump down if you tend the fire well enough. Fire only burns the surface of the root. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fire: People sometimes use scrap wood to start a fire on top of a
  stump and keep it going until the stump is gone. This is a great idea
  if you have a few stumps to remove, have scrap wood you want to get
  rid of and want to keep warm for the weekend. Remember to check with
  local officials on the time of year when you're allowed to burn in
  your area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this method. It is not really a Lifehack, but to remove your stumps you may opt for this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Backhoe/skidsteer Sometimes if stumps are in planting areas we will
  pull them with a backhoe. This is the costliest way to remove stumps,
  although the expense can be kept to a minimum if you have a lot of
  stumps to do and a place to bury them on site. Burying eliminates the
  cost of hauling stumps away and disposing of them off-site. Bear in
  mind that it is inadvisable to bury stumps in a wetlands area, and
  remember too that no matter where you bury a stump, the area is going
  to settle sooner or later. Of course, having a backhoe on your
  property does create a large mess, so I usually only do this on new,
  large construction areas. Small- to medium-size stumps can be removed
  quickly with a skidsteer machine. A bucket with teeth or the pallet
  fork attachment will pop the stump out, which you can then gather in
  the bucket and bury on site. Skidsteers are available for rent, but
  backhoes usually are not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the Stump Grinder:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stump grinder: This is a machine that literally chews up stumps 6 to
  12 inches below ground level. A set of carbide teeth makes quick work
  of small- to medium- size stumps; large ones will take a little time.
  I remove all the grindings to the compost pile and fill the craters
  with loam. If you enjoy running such equipment, these machines are
  available at rental houses. If machinery is not your thing, or you
  only have one or two stumps to do, many arborists have stump grinders
  and will do the grinding on a per-stump-inch price basis. If you have
  many stumps to get rid of, a stump grinder is the most economical way
  to go. Make sure you get complete instructions on how to operate the
  machinery and wear appropriate safety equipment.</p>

<p>Of course, you don't have a cooler to bring along, only normal beach stuff. Besides, it doesn't look cool to carry a cooler to buy icecream and beverages...</p>

<p>As a variation, what item could one bring along to the beach (except for a cooler) to ease the task at hand?</p>
","<p>I would definitely use as many towels as possible, as per @Peter Crotty's answer - but I wouldn't wet them. Water is a much better conductor than air. Wrapping them with as much material as possible is the key, preferably light coloured on the outside to reflect as much light/heat as possible.</p>

<p>We tend to think that insulating things makes them <em>warm</em> but it helps to think of it as keeping them <em>the same</em>.</p>

<p>A suggestion: you could take 2 towels, fold the darkest one into 2 or 3 and wrap the goodies, then drop that bundle into the centre of the lighter towel, gather the corners into a ""bag"" that you can hold with one hand. As you walk, keep the ""bag"" in the shade of your body as best you can - but try to stop it contacting your body because, at 37 degrees, you are probably the worst enemy. The bag will mean you can hold the payload without the need to hug it to your chest.</p>

<p>EDIT: Another important thing I've just thought of.... You don't want the towels to be warm before you wrap the ice creams in them. If they are warm at the start (likely) then you need to allow them to cool in the air as you walk to the shop - but <em>without</em> letting the sun warm them! You'll have to figure that out for yourself. If they are not too warm then wrap the darker one in the lighter one to keep it the coolest.</p>

"How to remove rotten meat odour from the fridge?","2282","","<p>My friend forgot to trash meat from the fridge before the long school holiday.<br> After 3 weeks I returned to find the bad rotten meat left inside the fridge.<br>
Currently, I am alone in the house so removing the fridge is not an option for the next few days.</p>

<p>Any hack to remove the odour ?</p>
","<p>The human nose is extremely sensitive for the chemicals causing the smell of rotten meat as it has been a decisive evolutionary advantage to smell when meat has gone off and is not fit for consumption any more, even when faced with starvation. For this reason it is also near impossible to cover up these smells with other flavours. Also you wouldn't want your cheese to take on the smell of, say, lavender.  These chemicals will have soaked into the plastic lining inside your fridge and even cleaning with vinegar, while a good first thing to do, will not completely remove them. This process takes time.</p>

<p>Cleaning the fridge is the obvious first step to resolve the problem. </p>

<p>Then place a plate filled with plain tap water into the fridge and change the water about twice a day - for the vessel to use you are looking for a large surface area between water and air. This will eventually entrap the chemicals causing the smell while they dissipate from the plastic lining of your fridge through the air into the water. You will also notice a thin oily film on top of the water especially the first couple of times you replace it. After about a week the smell should have improved so far you may want to start using the fridge again for storing open food. Just continue with the water until you are satisfied the smell has completely gone (and it will be gone - I've tried it for rotten meat). </p>

<p>This hack works for a lot of other, less offensive smells in your fridge too.</p>

","<p>They actually make <a href=""https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=blender+sound+enclosure&amp;tbm=shop"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>blender sound enclosures</strong></a> which will dampen a blender's noise considerably. These are generally designed for retail applications (i.e. expensive), but you can draw on the basic design for inspiration.</p>

<p>In a previous living arrangement, I actually built an MDF box/cabinet to cover and store <em>luggable</em> appliances along the back of the counter top. The long cabinet which opened at the front was primarily intended to avoid having to lug out the heavier appliances, but closing the cabinet doors cut the noise <em>dramatically.</em> You can build a blender-sized version for your purposes (or an old speaker enclosure is ideal for this application). </p>

<p>Put your blender on a rubber or vinyl mat to keep it from turning your counter top into a large sound diaphragm. </p>

<p>You can deaden the noise further by adding acoustic insulation to the cabinet; but honestly, MDF has some pretty substantial sound-deadening properties, so I don't think the additional cost (and kitchen/cleaning unfriendliness) is worth it.</p>

"How to clean dried blood and bone from the car grill","2264","","<p>Sometimes I find dried blood and even bone in the grill of my car. Regular car soap does not remove the blood, especially if it has stained the chrome. Bits of bone also get stuck between metal and plastic body panels, which if not carefully removed could damage the finish, leaving bare metal exposed and possibly rust.</p>

<p>For removing the blood, I have tried high quality <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0009IQXFO"" rel=""nofollow"">car soap</a>, but the best solution that I have found is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartmann%27s_solution"" rel=""nofollow"">hartmanns solution</a>. However, this is very difficult to acquire. Are there any other good solutions?</p>

<p>For removing bone from between body panels without damaging the finish, the best solution that I have found is to use a disposable plastic spoon as the spoon will not damage the finish. However, one cannot apply much force to the delicate disposable spoon, so I need something sturdier. For removing bone from the grill and radiator, a spray of water <em>from the reverse side</em> sometimes works. Might I damage the motor by spraying water with the hood open?</p>
","<p>Dried blood can not easily be removed by general purpose soaps as it consists of rather firmly denaturized proteins designed for tightening wounds.</p>

<h3>Glass cleaner</h3>

<p>One known chemical dissolvent also capable of dissolving dried blood is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"" rel=""nofollow"">ammonia</a>, which is an ingredient of houshold glass cleaners. This makes it easily and widely available. Glass cleaners do come in a spray bottle to make application on a car grill easier. Nevertheless Ammonia only helps to soften the dried blood when soaked with it. We need some mechanical shrubbing in addition, best with a soft sponge or brush to not damage the chrome and varnish. Depending on the amount of blood it may also be sufficient to just spray water from a hose.</p>

<p>After the blood was removed we will likely get a much easier removal of other materials such a bone, hair or other body remnants, as they will be firmly attached by blood clots that act like glue here.</p>

<h3>Meat tenderizers</h3>

<p>In case we do not succeed with glass cleaner we can also add enzymes to ease dissolving the blood proteins. Such enzymes are found in laundry agents but we may get a much higher concentration of enzymes if we applied them directly. Powerful enzymes such as bromelain or papain are used in meat tenderizers. Therefore we can apply meat tenderizing powder on tenacious blood stains after soaking them.</p>

Stuff it into the shoe and press firmly. The clay should take the shape of the shoe, as if it were a foot within the shoe. After you are sure that the clay has taken up all the space in the shoe tip, pull it out carefully. Do not let the clay within the plastic cover change its shape. The Plastic cover will ensure that the clay wouldn't stick to the inside of the shoe. Now, we need the clay to retain the shape of the foot. For that you need to dry the clay, for which you could use so many methods such as sun drying or freezing it. Just ensure it doesn't become brittle and crumble-able. After it is dried, you could use it as a shoe tree. Optionally, you could remove the plastic cover, but be very careful if you decide to do so. You do not want your effort to be in vain by being too careless. You could use scented clay to give it a little fragrance too. That way you could avoid unwanted odor. You could add some fragrance to enhance the smell of the stored shoe also. Make sure it doesn't react with the clay mold.</p>

"How to undo slippery laminate flooring due to leather lotion","2227","","<p>We have accidentally sprayed some leather lotion on our laminate floor and it has become <em>extremely</em> slippery - the spot has become a major hazard in our apartment. Even at a slow pace, walking over the spot in socks is dangerous.</p>

<p>Is there a way to undo this? We've (thoroughly) tried ""cleaning"" this away with some all-purpose wet wipes (that we also normally use on the laminate when something minor gets spilled), to no avail.</p>

<p>The lotion is the <a href=""http://www.erdal.at/products/lederpflegelotion/"" rel=""nofollow"">Erdal Classic Lederpflegelotion</a>, there is no ingredient list on it.</p>
","<p>I just called the manufacturer:</p>

<p>The product contains various waxes which stick to the laminate and - as you learned - make it darn slippery.</p>

<p>Your everyday wipes will not remove the wax, apart from traces than may be polished off with lots and lots of ellbow grease and patience.</p>

<p>To strip the wax, you will need a ""residue remover"", the nice lady recommended something from their own line, of course, the <a href=""http://www.emsal.de/english/products/floor-care/details/p/layer-remover-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">emsal Grundreiniger</a> (Layer remover). Use less than the originally recommended dosage to start, perhaps a quarter, just to be safe. Use more if required.</p>

<p>Another alternative we discussed are those ""grease removers"" based on orange peel. They are often sold as ""Kraftreiniger"", my personal favourite is the <a href=""http://www.sonett.eu/index.php?id=33&amp;lang=de"" rel=""nofollow"">Sonnet Orangen Kraftreiniger</a> (scroll down, here's an <a href=""http://www.amazon.de/Sonett-Orangen-Kraftreiniger-0-5l/dp/B007IIN9WS"" rel=""nofollow"">amazon link</a>) I would hesitate to use the really strong ones like Oranex or at least dillute them very, very much.</p>

<p>For both, testing them in an inconspicuous spot is a good idea, but if you start with very dilluted cleaner they should be safe, the customer support assured me.</p>

<p>Independent of your product choice I would recommend using microfiber rags and plan for some scrubbing, mechanical action will support the cleaner's chemical reaction. Also, plan to ""rinse and repeat"", depending on how much product you got on your floor you may have to remove the residue in layers, not in one go.</p>

<p>The most interesting recommendation I got from customer support was to always wipe <em>the entire floor</em>, not to spot-clean. Laninate will always have very small dents and divots where a tiny bit of residue stays behind - a mixture of dust and dirt and cleaner from your wipes, probably. Spot cleaning might leave visible differences between the place of the spill and the rest, not because it affected the syrface, but because it is niw actually cleaner than the rest of your floor. </p>

"Eradicate a cockroach infestation","2208","","<p>A cockroach infestation has formed in my house a while ago, probably because food was left out and dishes were never done. However for the last few months I have made sure to keep the place clean and have even used a bug bomb (the thing that looks like fly spray, but you leave it on in your house for a few hours) but there still just as many if not more cockroachs now. I can't afford an exterminator. How can I find and eradicate this cockroach infestation </p>
","<p>Mix a bag of flower, a box of sugar, and a box of borax together in a large bowl.  Cover the infected area, probably your kitchen, and all nearby flat areas including the floor with the powder and <strong>do not</strong> touch the powder for at least 10 days. Also set out lots of glue traps against walls and in corners.</p>

<p>You will begin to notice that roaches are crawling around in the powder and then dying.  They are eating the sugar and simultaneously being poisoned by the borax.  The flour helps it to stick to them.  Just let them lay there, do not sweep them up for at least ten days.  After ten days you should notice that the glue traps are filled with roaches of all sizes and there are countless baby to medium roaches dead in the powder.</p>

<p>Sweep up the powder and then <strong>immediately</strong> get a few cans of caulk and caulk <strong>every single crack</strong> that you can find in your entire house. This will take a long time but it must be done or else they will just re infest.  After the caulk has dried spray all seams between walls and the floor with raid daily for at least two weeks.</p>

<p>At this point you should notice significantly less if not no roaches.  As long as you keep your house clean, i.e. do dishes immediately after using them, wipe up bathroom if it is wet after a shower, dont leave out food <strong>ever</strong>, etc. then you should be good.</p>

<p>I apologize for the gratuitous bolded text but this is incredibly important, I have waged all out war with roaches for extended periods of time.  I have won some and lost some but I have slowly crafted this method and it has never failed me. I know it is an inconvenience especially the powder and not touching it because it basically means that area is off limit.  I would suggest to cover the entire kitchen and either eat out for two weeks or have a very thin path to the microwave or fridge that you can use to travel.  </p>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Roaches love water. They love it. Never leave anything wet</li>
<li>Roaches are tiny.  They can get through basically any crack</li>
<li>Roaches swarm.  They are notorious for being incredibly persistent because they reproduce and swarm so quickly  </li>
<li>Roaches are widespread. It is likely that if you are infested then so are your neighbors I would suggest talking to them to learn more about the situation</li>
<li>Roaches must die.  If you ever to see one after this process, it must immediately be killed, preferably with raid in case any other roaches are around</li>

<p><strong>Is there a quick way to cool down my car so that I don't have to blast the air-con or wait for 10-15 minutes?</strong></p>
","<p>There are two hot things to deal with: SURFACES and AIR</p>

<p>AIR has pretty much one best solution, exchange the air. Opening one door can take a long time if you're just waiting passively for the air to covect out. You can actually see the hot air if you look on a hot day for the air shimmer or (even cooler) watch the shadow of the door you've opened. If you have passengers opening the passenger side the smart thing to do is coordinate opening your door before they get in and leave it open as they enter, this gives air time to enter from the windward size and exit from the leeward. You can turnover the air in a car in a few seconds with even slight wind this way and if you're sly about it the passenger may never know. I do this a lot. If it's just you getting into the car it's a little tricky to open opposing doors. One possibility is to have a door and sunroof open to get crossflow but if it's a power sunroof opening it can take too long and put strain on your battery. If you are alone and have no convenient sunroof then you may have to resort to the old ""swing around a magazine"" approach or some other inelegant way to move the air although since you're alone in this case nobody should see :)</p>

<p>SURFACES are harder to cool because they have both more thermal mass and lower thermal dissipation (air is an insulator but convection actually exchanges the air which increases cooling speed by factors of 100). My usual solution for surfaces is to pick a couple important ones and change the surface into something that doesn't gather or convey heat to the user as well. This is a good reason for wood steering wheels or certain types of steering wheel and seat covers. Choices all depend on your preferred looks and textures as well as which surfaces get hot enough to be worth fixing.</p>

<p>There are a lot of fine variations here (like maybe a small battery fan to move the air). I look forward to useful additions in the comments.</p>

","<p>Without a heater, you're not going to be able to really warm up the bathroom.<br>
But there are a few hacks to mitigate your problem:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Use a shower curtain to close off the shower stall. Keep this closed as much as possible. The warm water from the shower generally contains enough energy to warm up the shower stall, but not enough to warm up the whole bathroom. 
When you finish your shower, keep the curtain closed and dry off inside the shower stall. </li>
<li>If you have a shower head that can be detached and aimed at the walls: at the end of your shower, aim the shower head at the walls and run hot water over the walls. This warms them up. </li>
<li>Dry off quickly. A wet skin cools off much quicker than a dry skin. </li>
<li>Have a bathrobe (or your clothes) nearby but protected from the water, to minimize the time you spend naked. </li>

"How do I sharpen a knife in the wild?","2043","","<p>I went camping near a river the other day, and realized that my trusty pocketknife was pretty dull. It made my camping experience not too fun. Is there any way to get a knife reasonably sharp without real tools (e.g. dedicated stone, or sharpening steel)? I'm in the wilderness, and don't have these tools with me, nor access to a store where I could buy them.</p>
","<p>I saw a Youtube video on this a while back*....can't find it now, but I'll post whatever I remember.</p>

<p>Basically, the way knife-sharpening works is that you shave off little bits of metal, in order to make the edge of your knife V-shaped. Ideally, you'd use a steel or a specialized stone for this, but if you don't have any, here are some things you could use instead:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Top of a car window</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bottom of a ceramic mug</strong> (<em>see also <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5479413/sharpen-your-kitchen-knife-on-a-coffee-mug"">this article</a> by <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/"">Lifehacker</a></em>)</li>
<li>You might use <strong>cement</strong>, but only for about two seconds, and only in place of a really coarse stone (=for beginning stage sharpening)</li>
<li>If you're camping, you might use a straight metal <strong>tent-peg</strong> in place of a steel (my suggestion, not from the video)</li>
<li>If you're near a river, <strong>flat river stones</strong> might help you (but try to find a big one, for ease-of-use)</li>
<li>Also suggested by Crazy Russian Hacker, if I remember correctly, is to use a <strong>leather belt as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_strop"">strop</a></strong>, basically running the knife backwards over the leather belt, to give it a nicer finish. This may not help you if your knife is severely out of shape, but it could work to make an almost-good knife perfect. I've done this myself when I wanted to show my knife (pictured in my gravatar) to a professional <em>shochet</em>, and although I had my stones with me, I didn't have time to soak them and sharpen my knife properly. I just took off my belt, ran the knife over it several times, and the knife <em>really</em> improved a lot. Kudos to Jon for reminding me of this hack :)</li>
</ul>

<p>I would suggest that you do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use <strong>another knife</strong>, because you have a good chance of ruining at least one of your knives, if not both of them.</li>
</ul>

"How to quickly cure hiccups","2043","","<p>Hiccups are the worst. Whenever I get them, I get them bad. I usually hiccup constantly for 30 minutes to an hour, distracting me and my family. I've heard of tons of ways to get rid of them like take deep breaths, drink water while sitting upside down, or hold your breath. None of these have worked. <strong>What is a quick, easy way to get rid of the hiccups?</strong></p>
","<p>There are lots of purported folk remedies for hiccups. Inasmuch as some of them work at all, it isn't clear to what extent this is for physiological or psychological reason, or just because hiccups eventually goes away on its own and people only remember that it went away while they were trying something.</p>

<p>For medical references, I refer you to threads on <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/"">Skeptics Stack Exchange</a>:</p>

</ul>

<p>These two methods probably don't work though these threads don't offer conclusive proof that they work.</p>

<p>One method that seems to work for several people (it's worked for me too) is to swallow as much air as possible and maintain tension on your diaphragm. I breath in to the point where I can't do it anymore and then hold my breath for a minute or so; it usually works for me. I don't know to what extent this is physiological. <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/1575"">Tanath</a> reports that it “works immediately and every time” (for me, it takes a minute or so and only works most of the time). <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1437/does-drinking-water-upside-down-help-cure-hiccups#comment28598_1575"">John C</a> notes that what matters is tension on the diaphragm, not holding your breath per se (I can confirm that it doesn't work if I don't breathe in fully before holding my breath).</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=11790"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NYU medical center</a> offers several possible remedies with no explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Eating hard to swallow items such as granulated sugar or molasses</li>
  <li>Sucking on ice cubes</li>
  <li>Gagging with purpose</li>
  <li>Valsalva maneuver — holding your breath and bearing down, as you might when having a bowel movement</li>
  <li>Breathing into a bag</li>

","<p>Depending on where the gum landed, you can simply cool it quite a bit with ice, at which point it's much easier to remove with a comb.

"How can I make sure I get the USB plug in the right way up?","1997","","<p>In short, how can I avoid this problem depicted below?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bnx0H.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>All you have to do is follow the USB convention!</p>

<p>Every USB plug has (or is supposed to have) one side labeled with the USB symbol.  The pins should be exposed towards the side that is labeled with the USB symbol.  See below for an example:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuoCT.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuoCTm.jpg"" alt=""USB plug.""></a></p>

<p>On computers and chargers that have horizontal USB ports, the convention generally has the ports oriented such that, when a USB cable is installed, the USB symbol would point upwards.  For computers and devices that have vertical USB ports, the USB symbol would point leftward as viewed from the front of the device (or, if you rotated device 90 degrees clockwise as viewed from the front, the USB symbol would point upwards).  Some devices may be opposite this, depending on the device's ""preferred"" horizontal orientation (for example, a PC tower that can lay flat may need to be rotated either CW or CCW, and the USB port orientation should be set based on that horizontal orientation).</p>

<hr>

<p>As some of the comments have pointed out, this is not always followed by all manufacturers.  But it is in the USB specification.  Referring to the USB 2.0 spec:</p>

<p><strong>6.5.1:</strong> The USB Icon is embossed, in a recessed area, on the topside of the USB plug. This provides easy user recognition and facilitates alignment during the mating process. The USB Icon and Manufacturer’s logo should not project beyond the overmold surface. The USB Icon is required, while the Manufacturer’s logo is recommended, for both Series “A” and “B” plug assemblies. The USB Icon is also located adjacent to each receptacle. Receptacles should be oriented to allow the Icon on the plug to be visible during the
mating process.</p>

It's gotten so bad, that the lid no longer performs its function of keeping water out of my paper recycling.</p>

<p>I could buy a new bin, but it seems a shame to toss it when only the lid is affected.  Also, tossing a bin is difficult without a larger bin to put it inside of.</p>

<p>I'd like to repair it!</p>

<p>The bin is made out of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which has a melting point of 110C and bonds poorly with most adhesives.</p>

<p>Ideas I've had:</p>

<ul>
<li>Duct tape.  Probably won't last that long, and hard to form a watertight seal.</li>
<li>Welding with a blow dryer.  Probably not hot enough.</li>
<li>Welding with a hot frying pan.  Probably hot enough, but might be hard to achieve the accuracy needed.</li>
<li>Welding with my soldering iron.  Probably hot and accurate enough, but would ruin my soldering tip :(</li>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkKFJ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkKFJ.jpg"" alt=""Cracks in LDPE plastic""></a></p>
","<p>I'm not exactly sure what a ""plastic welding kit"" is, but I've made almost identical repairs with a Benzomatic propane torch (the blue can). The trick (in my case) was getting the pieces lined up enough so that they would stick to each other when heated, and for that I would use duct tape on the opposite side of the side I was heating, then remove that tape and reverse it for the other side, just for extra strength. It will never be as strong as the original, but if all you're interested in for now is a water tight seal, then it's a start.</p>

<p>For reference, the can I'm talking about is here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002DVN7OU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/C-R-Laurence-LP1759-Standard-Cylinder/dp/B002DVN7OU/</a></p>

<p>They are relatively inexpensive (US$10) in hardware stores, and may or may not come with a torch top, depending on which option you buy.</p>

<p>If you want to get really fancy, find other sources of LDPE (Plastic #4 if things are labelled) and make strips of ""plastic solder"" to add plastic to your weld. This is much more work, but will make the weld much stronger in the long run.</p>

<p>If that's your idea of a ""plastic welding kit"" then of course feel free to ignore this answer, but again, I've had success with this, and having a propane torch around the house can be pretty useful for other projects too.</p>

<p>Side note, the yellow Benzomatic cans are Map-Pro gas, and burn much much hotter than required for plastic, (can heat steel enough to bend small pieces) so definitely don't get that or the red can. (Not sure what it is, but I know it's used in welding along with the Map-pro.)</p>

<p>On the bottom of some of these, you'll find unglazed ceramic where it's been cut, using this you can rub the blade of the knife along this unglazed edge, and because it's harder than the material of most knives (not hardened steel maybe) it will cause the edge of the knife to align, the same way a toning rod does.</p>

","<p>I've used dish soap before, and it did ok but you still have to go back over it with the windex.  I've actually found that using vinegar on windows has worked quite well.  I use it with the shop towels, as they don't leave the fibers behind that traditional paper towels do.  You can pick them up at any auto parts store, or even Wal-Mart (they're the blue towels in the auto section).  The vinegar cuts through the grime, and then I also like to go over it with the Rain-X product because it helps to prevent the glass from fogging up in the winter.  I've also found that in using the rain-x, I don't have to clean my windows as often - a nice little bonus for me, as I absolutely hate cleaning my car....I try to get my kids to do it, and sometimes bribe them  ;) </p>

<li><code>=</code>    window</li>
<li><code>[AC]</code>  Air Conditioning intake</li>
</ul>

<p>My girlfriend and I have our computer desks in the master bedroom. The problem we're having is only a fraction of the airflow comes out of vent 3 into the master bedroom, and it gets hot as **** in here. Note that for most of the day, the Master Bedroom window is in direct sunlight, aggravating the problem. We keep the blinds closed all day but are not allowed (by complex rules) to put anything in the window.</p>

<p>Normally ~60% of the airflow goes into the living room via vent <code>1</code>, ~30% goes into the smaller Bedroom via vent <code>2</code>, and ~10% of the airflow goes into the master bedroom via <code>3</code> (percentages estimated). If I close vent <code>2</code>, maybe ~15-20% comes out of vent <code>3</code> and the rest comes out of vent <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that vent 1 is a gigantic vent and <em>cannot be closed</em>. Our apartment complex maintenance staff are useless; every time we ask them for help with the AC, they just reset the thermostat and say everything is fine.</p>

<p>I've tried jamming cardboard into vent 1 to close it off but it doesn't seem to work well enough. We keep the bathroom and closet doors closed to reduce the square footage that needs cooling, but that doesn't help enough.</p>

<p>I'm looking for any suggestions on <em>how to better control the air flow</em> (not just 'how to stay cool'), whether that's by better obstructing the vents, partitioning the house with dividers, adjusting circulation with fans placed in specific places, or something else. I'm not sure where to start, and hoping someone will have good suggestions. Thanks!</p>
","<p>First, stop the extra heat from the window by putting up plastic in the window. Painters plastic should be good, just get a correctly sized piece and tape it up, making sure to completely seal the plastic to the window frame. </p>

<p>Next, I would put a big fan in a cold part of the living room and aim it down the hall to your room with the door open to let the cold air in. </p>

<p>Or you could blow the hot air from your room towards the thermostat so that the ac runs until your room is closer to acceptable. </p>

<p>If you want to block the big vent, you should take the vent down, then put the cardboard over the vent, then put the vent back up so the cardboard stays in place. </p>

"How to repair and clean traffic cones?","1806","","<p>We have some short and tall traffic cones. Some of them are out of maintenance, and need to be repaired &amp; cleaned. The two big questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I clean the traffic cones?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I repair the traffic cone's white bands?</p></li>

<p>As you can see, there are three types of traffic cones, from left to right as defined 1, 2, and 3. Number 1 is dirty; number 2 is both dirty and damaged; number 3 on the right is short and repaired temporarily.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7wQZM.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7wQZMm.jpg"" alt=""dirty traffic cone""></a></p>

<p>You can see the dirty cones contain oil, dust, etc. and need to be cleaned. Which product should I use without harming the plastic surface and it's colour?</p>

<p>To be clear, I bought a thin reflective band in order to surround the cone, but according to the geometric rules, if I use a rectangle sided band on a cone, I will face some material gaps that I don't want. Also, the problem is that bands are very expensive here in Turkey.</p>
","<p>Here is my current solution. First of all, I cut every old and dirty reflective sticker with a utility knife:</p>

<p>I used a green roughed dish sponge with Cif Cream to rub, and cleaned with water.</p>

<p>I bought large reflective rulo from an advertising banner shop in the city center, then I cut it into lots of rectangular pieces. Each has almost the same length &amp; width:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aLiT3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aLiT3m.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>After that, I put these pieces onto the cleaned surfaces of the traffic cones. While I was doing this, I needed to force the surface inside to attach the sticker correctly on to the straight side. Even though the surface is cone shaped, when I forced the material inside and under, thanks to the surface's flexible material (not all, just some of them are soft), it performed as if the area was flat. I put the sticker on smoothly with ease:</p>

<p>You can easily see when you are near the cones, I had unwanted and unneccessary corners when we put the stickers on. I used a utility knife to modify all corners in order to look good.</p>

<p>I know that these methods are not original. According to the traffic safety, I must clean and repair these old traffic cones.</p>

"How to get home after losing lugnuts?","1782","","<p>Say I'm changing a flat tire on the side of the road and I lose the lugnuts to a wild bear. (Okay, it doesn't have to be a bear. Just say they fall into the storm sewer.)</p>

<p>Short 4 lugnuts, how do I get home?</p>
","<p>You definitely don't want to hack a <em>replacement</em> for lugnuts, since it's a major safety issue. What you really need is more lugnuts.</p>

<p>Luckily, you have some! Take some off the other wheels, and evenly distribute them between all four wheels. Since <em>most</em> consumer vehicles have 4-6 nuts on each (heavier vehicles tend to have more), you should be missing two at most from any wheel. Any you're missing two from, make sure the missing nuts aren't adjacent around the wheel.</p>

<p>This should be fine as long as you aren't at maximum capacity for your vehicle (weight, not number of passengers). I wouldn't do this while towing or hauling anything, for example, and I'd probably try to stay below highway speed.</p>

<p>To be honest, unless you have another vehicle at home, I'd recommend first driving to the store to get some more lugnuts. Either way, take it nice and easy, and get some more nuts to replace them as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have a very old vehicle (40+ years or so), the lugnuts on the left side wheels may be threaded differently from the ones on the right. If that's the case, you might just want to call someone for a ride, since you'd only have half the normal number of nuts on each wheel on the affected side.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should probably also do something about the bear before removing the other lugnuts. You don't want to lose them, too. And pick up some bear mace or something after you get it fixed.</p>

stronger. There is higher attenuation in the buildings.</p></li>

3dB attenuation in human body. If you use a headset you can put the
phone away from your head and hold it higher for better signal
reception (or you can hold it out of the window). </p></li>

<p><strong>Is there any other way to protect the lace holes from getting torn?</strong></p>
","<p>How to lace shoes for proper fit. (a technique to use for the eyelet style)</p>

<p>Proper shoe lacing prevents unnecessary stress on the eyelets (the small holes for the lace) and the counters (backs of the shoes). Here are a number of ways to lace shoes.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.aofas.org/.../Lacing-Techniques-for-Proper-Shoe-Fit.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aofas.org/.../Lacing-Techniques-for-Proper-Shoe-Fit.aspx</a></p>

<p>Dress shoes often have leather to lace unreinforced eyelet treatment. There are a number of ways to make attractive lacing patterns here.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ties.com/how-to-tie-dress-shoes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ties.com/how-to-tie-dress-shoes</a></p>

<p>You can also buy aftermarket self-backing reinforced eyelets to install yourself. While the link takes you to a source that might be more than you want to order, it is a possibility. A shoe repair station may give or sell you a lesser amount for your pair. Get a few extras for other eyelets, too. This is increasing the cost of the pair you already bought. You can blame the manufacturers for passing the cost on to you after the sale. Avoid one-piece ""grommets"" which are weak and split easily. Ask for two-piece ones that are made well and don't tear the shoe or the lace.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.shoe-eyelets.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shoe-eyelets.com/index.html</a></p>

<p>First and foremost, avoid round hard laces that don't distribute the stress evenly. Substitute and use a flat soft fabric lace.</p>

<p>The maximum tension is exerted at the eyelets where you pull. If the lace across the toe is too loose, pulling the laces hard at the top exerts minimal force to the lace tension at the toe.</p>

<p>After the laces appear the way you find most attractive, begin to tighten them by taking up the slack length starting with the toe and working your way up from there.</p>

<p>When pulling shoelaces tight, pull outwards rather than upwards, to lessen friction against the holes.</p>

<p>Pull firmly and evenly and don't tug quickly on the lace ends.<br/></p>

Pull the belts <em>all</em> the way out and let it back in a bit. If you can't tug it out again, then it's locked. Wrap them around your cushioned TV and buckle them in. Let the belt all the way back it, making sure it stays locked. You can even tug it a little tighter - pulling away from the buckle and helping it retract a bit more - for a snug fit.</p>

<p>The belt will unlock again once it gets retracted enough so it's possible that'll happen here. Add some more cushions to force the belt out more and try again. You should end up with a snug, cushioned fit.</p>

"How to clean my ear canal with something more reusable than a cotton swab?","1601","","<p><strong>Issue</strong>: I <em>must</em> clear my ear canals of water or I will get ""swimmer's ear"" (an ear infection). Regularly cleaning the ear wax helps prevent infections. I currently use cotton swabs, but I would like to use a non-disposable item.</p>

<p>I have not tried many options because cotton swabs have been convenient until recently. Cotton swabs are 100% effective for me. I have tried using my pinky finger, using a towel, and shaking my head, but none of those solutions have consistently worked. <em>However</em>, because cotton swabs have been effective it is possible (but unlikely) that one of the three above solutions could work if I knew a better process.</p>

<h2>Constraints (important)</h2>

<ol>
<li>I live in a tent.</li>
<li>I am constantly traveling.</li>
<li><em>Everything</em> I own must fit in my pack, therefore <em>size</em> and <em>weight</em> is important.</li>
<li>I am in Central America, and I am rarely in cities, so my access to many items is limited.</li>
<li>I <em>strongly</em> prefer a non-disposable solution.</li>
<li>I prefer to have items with multiple functions.</li>
<li>Extremely limited budget.</li>
</ol>
","<p>Toilet paper works well for this:</p>

<li>Take one sheet of toilet paper.</li>
<li>Roll up one of the corners into a wick.</li>
<li>Gently stick the wick in your ear. It will absorb the water. </li>
</ol>

<p>If you insist on reusability, use a thin cloth instead. A T-shirt or handkerchief will do. You won't be able to roll this into a really thin wick, but if you fold it twice you get a corner you can stick in your ear. </p>

<p>To make the procedure more effective, lean over until your ear points straight down. </p>

"How can I relieve the itchiness from a mosquito bite?","1576","","<p>I suffer quite regularly from mosquitoes bites in my home because I live in an area with many places well suited for them to breed; Stagnant bodies of water. </p>

<p>Are there any quick and easy methods to relieve the itch from a mosquito bite using readily available house-hold items? I am aware that there are many commercial solutions for skin irritation but I'm more interested in alternative treatments.</p>
","<p>I have found that heating a metal teaspoon and pressing it against the bite provides almost instant and permanent relief from the itching (the redness and 'bump' will remain while the wound heals).</p>

<ul>
<li>Heat a teaspoon by pouring some <strong>hot</strong> water over the spoon side.<br>
I use boiling water from a kettle <strong>(which is WAY too hot)</strong> but allow it to cool down for several seconds testing the temperature regularly. </li>
<li>Let the teaspoon cool to a tolerable temperature then press it firmly against the bite and hold it there for 5-10 seconds. </li>
</ul>

<p>The teaspoon should be hot enough to cause a slight stinging feeling on the skin but only for a split second; It should be as hot as you can stand it without burning you. If you are using boiling water, like me - be very careful not to burn yourself!</p>

<hr>

<p>From what I gather, It's not too clear what exactly causes the itching sensation; It's either the mosquitoes saliva or the histamines that the body creates to deal with this foreign intrusion. </p>

<p>It is my understanding that the heat from the teaspoon inhibits the effectiveness/activity of both the enzymes in the mosquito saliva (Denaturation) and the bodies histamines.</p>

"How can I better clean headphones that sit inside the ear?","1543","","<p>I have a pair of headphones that I use regularly, including while I'm working out. They're the kind of headphones that sit inside the ear (earbuds), so inevitably they'll get kind of gross after a couple uses. They have the removable rubber tips on them, but I don't think that helps keep everything out of the speaker part.</p>

<p>It's easy to wipe the occasional earwax out of the removable rubber tips, but for the inside parts where the speaker is I'm having trouble with making sure those are clean. Normally I'm able to clean any earwax that makes it through the rubber tip using a toothpick or a piece of paper that I've folded up, but I would actually like it to get sanitized when it's cleaned, since I use them while working out they could harbor some bacteria, and I would rather not get swimmer's ear from them.</p>

","<p>I recently looked up a similar question myself and I can across a way to make your own counterfeit money pen (if it goes one colour it's real, the other other colour it is fake type thing).</p>

<li><strong><em>A syringe</em></strong> (can be obtained online if you don't have any lying around)</li>
<li><strong><em>Iodine</em></strong> (which is an antiseptic so it can be easily obtained from any drug store / pharmacy)</li>
</ul>

<p>What you'll need to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure the felt tip marker is free from any ink</li>
<li>Take 2-3ml of the iodine into the syringe (this may take a little while)</li>
<li>Inject the iodine directly into the tip of the marker or highlighter until it starts to ooze out</li>
<li>Wait for it to get absorbed by the marker and then repeat a couple of times</li>
</ul>

<p>And there you have it, you can get a bank note and try marking it - if it comes out yellow/amber/brown, it's genuine, if it marks the note black, it's a dud.  See image below (the small crosses are the pen marks)</p>

<p>Remove the inner tube and spray it with soap water. Pump up the tube a little, not a lot since you don't want to burst it, and check for bubbles. Repair any holes found. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: also check the tire for sharp things to cause a new hole. Visually check the inside and outside of the tire. Then rub your fingers along the inside of the tire, be careful and do this slowly so you don't hurt yourself. </p>

<p>As far as avoiding pumping your tires up after storing the bike or not riding for a long time, you can either just deal with it or take the bike for a short ride every couple of days. </p>

<p>As a side note, I've heard storing a bike on carpet causes the deflation faster than other materials. </p>

"Bad kids stealing mangoes from my trees at home","1415","","<p>I have 3 mango trees in my garden and my house is surrounded by a 4.5 feet compound wall. Random kids from my street tend to climb upon my wall and start to steal mangoes. sometimes they throw stones to get them, which falls &amp; spoils flower pots in my garden. How to protect my mangoes and prevent them from stealing? </p>
","<h3>Prune the tree</h3>

<p>Immediately after harvest this year, prune the tree away from the wall.  Make sure that all the branches are well inside the wall, and lower to the ground.  By making the tree less visible, and requiring people to completely climb over the fence you'll discourage most random casual theft.</p>

<p>Further, the tree should fruit more productively over time if it is well-pruned, and should you lose additional fruit to theft, it won't impact you as significantly.</p>

<h3>Plant another tree</h3>

<p>Another tactic is to plant another mango tree, thus producing twice as much fruit as you have now, allowing you to freely give the fruit away without worrying too much about whether permission was obtained.</p>

<h3>Extend the fence up</h3>

<p>Adding another 2-3 feet of lattice, wire, or bamboo fencing on top of your existing wall may be permissible (check your local building codes).  Lightweight and inexpensive, it should be easy to install.  Because it's not heavy duty, climbing over it would be an act of destruction, and will discourage many people from attempting.</p>

<p>The extension will also limit visibility, and make rock-throwing less successful.</p>

<h3>Pinch buds at beginning of season</h3>

<p>With a few minutes work a day at the beginning of the season, you can remove the flowers or fruit buds from the side of the tree that overhangs past the fence, and locations that are easy to get to from the fence.  Just remove the buds or flowers by pinching and twisting.</p>

<p>The remaining fruiting locations will typically do even better than usual, as the tree will expend most of its energy on the surviving buds.  </p>

","<p>You basically has three options: heating, reducing area to be heated, and better insulation. Outside of this, there are no lifehacks ever going to save you, so let us tackle each one.</p>

<h2>Heating</h2>

<p>The most common heat sources are wood, gas and electricity. Electricity is by far the most efficient way in terms of heat produced. To reduce electricity usage, do use a heater directly instead of indirect heat through a refrigerator, lights, or other electrical equipment. They might have other benefits, but the heat value will be reduced as compared to a proper heater.</p>

<p>Gas can be a good alternative, but requires enough ventialation not to be a safety hazard. However there does exist good gas ovens, which are allowed for indoor use, and if you have the money you can invest in dedicated gas ovens for indoor use.</p>

<p>Wood is also a good alternative, and can be very useful and cheap if you have a good supply. This does however require a working fireplace, which the OP in this case says is not available.</p>

<h2>Reduce area to be heated</h2>

<p>If you have limited heating capabilities, it is always an option to reduce the are which needs to be heated. In one apartment I rented, I chose to close off two rooms in the winter, to reduce the electricity needed for heating. </p>

<p>Either close off rooms for the cold seasons, or accept that some of the rooms are going to be colder. You can also try to divide existing rooms using either light walls, or blankets in a pinch, which will help a little.</p>

<p>A variant of reducing area to be heated, is to allow the room to be colder, but use more and better clothes. This allows for you not to freeze, whilst the overall temperature in the room is lower. This can also be accomplished by using blankets when seated, or possibly a mattres heater when in bed.</p>

<h2>Better insulation</h2>

<p>Your best option is usually to get better insulation. Insulate walls, roof, floor and windows. Try to locate the coldest surface, and start there when insulating.</p>

<p>Note that adding blankets/rugs can help insulate both walls and floors. If you have really old windows, it can help with thicker curtains or if really cold by inserting extra windows or even insulation boards.</p>

<p>On a lighter note: <em>A person usually generates around 100 W of heat, so inviting a lot of friends over will increase the temperature quite fast!</em></p>

Nothing a lot sandpaper and time cant fix, but I would really like to know which method is the best for a clean cut. </p>

<p>The one I have tried is scoring the out side of a bottle, use a candle to heat around the score, and then use ice to immediately cool the glass down. This is done repeatedly until the glass breaks. </p>

<p>I need a clean break because I want to use the bottom half of the bottle as a drinking glass. </p>
","<p>Getting a glass cutter or even using one for plumbing pipe to score the glass.. than bake the glass in a oven, 150 deg for 10 min or so than take a cold rag around the area above the scored area wanting removal. should snap right off..
If its still sharp use a torch to round the top off </p>

"How to quickly remove odors from the air?","1286","","<p>This questions is regarding the removal or covering up of a bad smell in the air quickly - specifically, a misjudged moment of flatulence. </p>

<p>I'm sure everyone has done it, you've been in a room alone and you've been desperate to break wind for a while and it turns out to be a little more unpleasant to the nose than initially anticipated and the immediate panic of someone coming into said room occurs so you try and flail your arms around to remove the smell or dilute it somehow but it never seems to work in time! Leaving you embarrassed and the other person disgusted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>So, does anyone know of any way to quickly remove a bad smell (fart) without deodorant or other standard smelly products?</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
","<p>A simple box of matches - not the ones with red tips (although these are better than nothing), you need the black or brown tipped ones; in the UK, that's ordinary safety matches. Strike one immediately after releasing your flatulence, and no, it doesn't have to be in the region of your backside, you're not trying to ignite anything, just strike it into the air. My bathroom always has a box of matches on a shelf behind the loo... Unlike air fresheners and deodorizers, a struck match removes the smell completely, but it doesn't work with a lighter.</p>

<p>Course, everyone will wonder what the hell you're doing if you're in an office or something, so only you can decide whether its worse to claim the dreadful smell as yours, or have everyone suspect its yours, or whether to dispose of the problem before anyone else smells it and explain why you've lit the match. It sounds like you need to keep a pack of matches in your back pocket if its a frequent problem - either that or a change in diet.</p>

<p>I did try:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting a pair of pliers by  the door so that whoever's going in can use it to turn the steel shaft. This slips easily if you don't have a great grip, and pinches you. Also not convenient if you're carrying much.</li>
<li>Tying down the opposite handle, so that the door can be opened from the outside without turning the shaft. This (even in combination with the method above) didn't help at all with those carrying a load of groceries or whatever. </li>
</ul>
","<p>I found a hack that works well for me:</p>

<p><strong>Use a vice-grip as the door handle.</strong> If you make it tight enough, it won't slip.</p>

While I'm making sure to do all my laundry and DIY on Saturdays, I was also looking at things like UPS batteries to enable me to use some of that power on other days or at other times. These seem to be prohibitively expensive though, <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/APC-Back-UPS-BX-Uninterruptible-Shutdown/dp/B00T7BYV6W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476711136&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ups"" rel=""nofollow"">This ups</a> would allow me to run my computer for about 10 minutes at most, and the electricity to do that would only cost 1/600th the cost of the battery!</p>

<ul>
<li>All washing &amp; tumble drying</li>
<li>All power-tool based DIY</li>
<li>Weekly meal prep using electric oven (ie curry or casserole for the week)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this means I'm using about 10% less electricity on other days of the week, but I'd like to push that even further if possible.</p>
","<p>Any energy storage is going to require investment -- and the magnitude of the investment relative to the amount of energy you can store is why power utilities almost never attempt to store energy (as opposed to offering consumers incentives to use power when they have excess capacity, as they've done with you).</p>

<p>Batteries aren't the only way, of course -- you can store energy by lifting weights, including pumping water into a high tank, and using the weights' fall later to generate power; by spinning up a large flywheel to very high speed, and using the flywheel to run a generator later, or by pressurizing a gas that will later be used to run a motor/generator.</p>

<p>Of these, only lifting a weight (either a solid mass, or liquid) is reasonably obtainable without high-tech equipment, and reasonably efficient.  It will still require more investment per kilojoule (both in money and in time) than batteries and an electronic inverter to give AC output of the correct voltage.  Worth noting that nearly all UPS units can be upgraded by connecting larger batteries; deep cycle lead-acid batteries are currently the most cost-effective for this, and cost significantly less than a similar capacity in the gel-cell lead-acid batteries usually found inside a UPS.  You could also assemble your own such system from batteries, a charger, and an inverter, likely at lower cost than a UPS (because you're not paying for their automatic switch-over feature and hardware damage warranty).  Look at systems designed to use solar power with regular mains-powered appliances for building cues.</p>

<p>But, they're the <strong>patent leather</strong>, and the toes have suffered the normal ""Dr. Marten's damage"" that a work shoe usually gets. But the visual effect is pretty excruciating ... to my mother!</p>

<p>What can I do to make these ""Sunday appropriate""? Cuz they're <strong>not</strong> coming off of these feet until 2017 to fit my shoe budget.</p>
","<p>This is a Looooooong answer ‘cuz it’s a loooooooong process.</p>

<p>This is a simple procedure but it’s not easy and will take some time to undo the damage already done to the boots. When you’re finished, you’ll have a mirror shine. This is the technique used for polishing boots for a military dress inspection.</p>

<p>You will require very fine sandpaper, clean polishing cloths (clean cotton dusting rag) or cotton balls/wool/etc., boot polish, a small bowl of water, a shoe brush, strong motivation, and a generous amount of elbow grease.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove the laces.</p></li>
<li><p>Carefully remove the material that has torn and lifted. Trim the edges near the surface without pulling off the enamel that still remains attached to the boot. A pair of small scissors may be helpful. Normally, one starts with boots in slightly better condition.</p></li>
<li><p>Smooth the rough edge with the sandpaper and try to make it as even as possible. Try not to remove much material when doing this. You want to make the surface look more normal than they do in your photos.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, you’re ready to start to rebuild the finish with polish. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Brush off any dirt or dust on the boot, from heel to toe.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrap the duster cloth around your index finger, making sure there are no wrinkles. Apply a medium layer of polish to the boot using the duster and your finger. Rub it in until a faint shine starts to show.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the faint shine comes through and the polish has been worked into the boot, take your index finger and the cloth and dip it lightly into the water, and start rubbing it into the boot over the polish in small circles about an inch wide. Keep doing this until a greater shine comes through and the swirls start to disappear.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave it to dry for a few minutes, and then once dry, take your index finger again and apply a thin layer of polish to the boot, start rubbing it in until an even better shine comes through, then apply the water to it using the method in Step 3. Leave to dry again.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the damp index finger and apply a tiny dot of polish to the boot and work in till it shines. Make sure that the cloth is very damp but not dripping. Do the whole boot paying more attention to the damaged parts</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat Step 5 until you get the desired level of shine. You should apply maybe about 8-9 layers as it gives best shine.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the soft shoe brush and buff the boot all over until it starts to shine, then take the soft cloth and buff again until desired shine is obtained.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat until happy with results.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Tips</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use a Kiwi™ brand polish, as other brands will probably tarnish your boots and contain chemicals that will make them crack</p></li>
<li><p>The back of a teaspoon can be used to press normal polish into cracks in the boot before adding a coat of parade gloss to give the shine.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the polish to the sole edges as well. Boots look much neater and greater if they are cleaned literally from ground to top.</p></li>
<li><p>To get a gleaming shine, use Kiwi™ Parade Gloss polish AFTER a base of Kiwi™ Shoe Polish as it contains silicone which makes the shoe/boot much shinier - BUT will make the boots crack IF it is used as the base layer.</p></li>
<li><p>Another point to think about is to melt the polish onto the boot/shoe - sit the polish tin in hot water to soften to a thin paste and rub in.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also use vinegar instead of warm water for improved results.</p></li>
<li><p>Use more water than polish.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>More good boot shining tips from soldiers</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First get a lot of polish on your boots and melt with heat do this repeatedly until you have a good base on it. Then buff. Next, take a small amount of polish and apply in small circles. Breathe (like you would into cold hands—hot breath). Then, do small circles. Repeat until you can no longer see the circles.</p></li>
<li><p>Careful not actually light the polish on fire when you heat it. Unless, of course, you want your boot to start flaking.<br/>
The best thing I‘ve found is to just use ‘Kiwi™ Parade Gloss‘ instead of the regular black Kiwi™. get‘s ‘em shiny enough to pass an inspection.</p></li>
<li><p>The only way to get a really good (and durable) shine is to build up many thin layers. If you try to glob it on, or use some ‘trick‘, you may get an impressive shine, but it won‘t last and therefore, won‘t protect the leather. Of course you can‘t just take a new pair of boots out of the box and expect to get a good spit shine. I would suggest simply brush shining them while you break them in. Then after a few weeks you should have a good enough base to spit shine. Only spit shine the toe and heel (the hard non-flexible parts); if you spit shine the leather where it flexes, it will crack. Use cotton balls, a  little  bit of water and a  little  bit of kiwi, and make small, circular motions with very light pressure. After a few months, you‘ll find your boots require less work to get them looking good.</p>

<p>Of course, if you‘re going into the field, your main concern is protecting and waterproofing the leather, so a good brush shine should be sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>You need a good base coat applied thickly and brushed off.  After 20 or so of those then you spit shine with regular kiwi.  Many small applications.  If you apply it thickly it WILL crack and then you‘re stuck with bad boots.  A burn shine is a very risky gamble.  I‘ve seen it work and the result is impressive.  The other 99 out of 100 times the boots will be completely ruined.  </p>

<p>So here it is:  Base coats. Then, many (4 per day is what I do for the first month) thin coats of regular Kiwi™--Parade Gloss is a gimmick.  After the first month, you have enough of a shine built up that you can actually slack off somewhat. Eventually, one quick shine will do it.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to reduce the chance for the boots to crack, you will always shine them once and then wear them for a bit.  Walk around.  Always wear them after shining, then shine them some more.</p></li>
<li><p>It IS possible to do a ""burn shine"" without actually involving an open flame... you only need the polish to melt, and it doesn‘t take that much heat to do it. You can achieve the desired effect using a hair dryer on a hot setting, or you can use a heat gun if you happen to have one. Using a lighter in close proximity to the boot, without burning the leather itself, also isn‘t that hard. Just hold the lighter close to the boot until the polish melts (about 0.5 seconds).</p>

<p>Of course, all of this should be done as your final coat of polish after applying many, many base layers. I‘ve gotten really consistent results with it, probably because I put the time into those 3-4 coats each time I polish before the burn polish layer. If you‘re trying to find a quick, easy way, it won‘t work!!!</p>

<p>I‘ve heard horror stories of cadets who use windex, turtle wax, candle wax, vaseline, and all sorts of other garbage on boots, but for the long-term, nothing wields a good result like a little elbow grease.</p></li>
<li><p>Melt the wax IN the can!  Light it up with a lighter, let the top melt, put the lid back on to put the flame out.  You will have a layer of liquid polish.  I found it easier to apply and fill any divots, scuffs, etc., with a small round boot brush.</p>

<p>After applying a thin layer of this and allowing it to dry, I then buffed with the soft cloth, re-applied polish, and then buffed again.</p></li>
<li><p>For some reason I always had at least 30 minutes to work on my boots so I constantly buffed them using just Kiwi™ and horsehair brush. After a while, I needed just a quick buff and it was inspection ready.</p></li>

<p>I heard the paper from cigarettes or toilet paper help, but the question is:<br><br> 
<strong>Are there any other ways to stop the bleeding and continue or finish up on the shave?</strong></p>

<p>P.S. this is my first question on stack overflow, so tips and pointers are welcome to better my questions and answers!</p>
","<p>The simplest way to stop bleeding from a minor cut like a shaving nick is to apply direct pressure (a clean fingertip does the job nicely) for at least two minutes.</p>

<p>If you take blood thinners or have a low-grade clotting disorder, it might take <em>ten to thirty</em> minutes or more for clotting to occur, and the time must be restarted if you remove the pressure and bleeding restarts.  If you have full-blown hemophilia, you shouldn't be shaving at all, by any method (even an electric razor can skim off raised skin around a follicle and cause bleeding), though your doctor may suggest a trimmer with a suitable guard to control beard length.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you have to hold pressure for ten minutes or more to stop bleeding, you'll need to reapply your choice of shaving foam or soap before you can finish shaving, but if that applies to you, you should consider shaving by a method less likely to cause bleeding, such as an electric foil shaver.</p>

  <p>Many of you commented about using reusable bags in your chest freezers
  which I thought was just brilliant so that is what I did.  Sorting
  like with like is essential in a freezer so you can keep better track
  of what you have in there.  Reusable bags helps keep your sorted stuff
  separated and available to pull out quickly as needed.  I like it. 
  One bag I use for the deer meat and the other for the frozen fruit I
  buy for my smoothies.  Nothing fancy but it gets the job done.</p>

  <p>If you don't use any type of storage containers when filling your
  freezer you'll quickly have a jumbled mess.</p>
  
  <p>Baskets are perfect because they keep like items with like, keep
  things from spreading out over more space than they should take, and
  allow stacking.</p>
  
  <p>Stacking is important because you want to be able to easily lift the

"How can I dry my clothes quickly after rain?","1202","","<p>If I am going to work and on my way, I have wet clothes after walking in rain. What can I do during my commute on train to dry my clothes so they don't smell bad? </p>
","<p>The only solution against smelly clothing in the train is making sure that the clothing is clean, the only smell coming of it will be the nice smells that laundry or herbs in storage have added.</p>

<p>If they are dripping wet, you can part-dry them with a towel.<br>
In some kind of clothing you can do it by squeezing the parts which are wide enough that you can grip them. I would not try to do that with most fabrics as it leaves them wrinkled and in such a way that you can not get them right again while wearing.<br>
In very bad cases I have done it with trousers in the bathroom at work, when I had to wear the soaked through clothing where I was sitting in a cold draft. It will shorten the drying time but the clothing is still wet after you do this.
The best you can get with this is getting 'less wet' but the wet clothing smell will still be with you.</p>

<p>It is much better to use an umbrella and/or rain overtrousers and a rain jacket or coat so you avoid getting wet.<br>
In my part of the world, you just go to a bike shop or a shop where they sell items for people who do out of doors sports, and they will have rain jackets and rain coats. You wear these over a normal coat unless it is warm weather, when you use them instead.  </p>

<p>Or as I started with, have clothing that is so clean the only smell is a 'clean' smell.</p>

","<p>Not really - there are a couple of things in saliva which promote blood clotting, and other ingredients which may block infection, but it depends what bacteria are already in your saliva as to whether infection will be blocked or, in fact, introduced to the wound, see info in link (<a href=""http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/Holistic-Health/Health-Myths-Center.aspx?ChunkID=157011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/Holistic-Health/Health-Myths-Center.aspx?ChunkID=157011</a>)</p>

<p>When you wound yourself, the body produces an enzyme called thromboplastin within the wound, which promotes blood clotting by converting the prothrombin already present in the damaged area to thrombin in the early stages of the process, thus helping the blood to clot.</p>

<p>The best way to stop bleeding is by applying pressure, and if you've knocked yourself without breaking the skin, preventing or lessening bruising can be achieved by applying pressure with an ice pack.</p>

Any life hacks for easing an upset stomach, specifically during a hangover?</p>
","<p>The main reason people get stomach aches when they are hungover is because drinking a lot of alcohol raises the level of acid in your stomach. To cure this, you need to soak up the acid. Eating something dry like plain toast (nothing on it) or saltine crackers. I know you don't want to eat anything because you don't want to vomit, but these foods are not tough on your stomach, so you shouldn't have to throw up. If you do throw up, it's not all bad because vomiting can help you cure your stomach ache. Also, to avoid a hangover, try to drink lots of water before you go to sleep the night you were drinking.</p>

","<p>If you do not open the bottle (i.e. don't allow any CO2 to escape), thaw out the bottle so it is liquid again, and then wait long enough, the high CO2/gas pressure will eventually drop as the CO2 goes back into the liquid/cola. If you open the bottle too soon after thawing it, it will act just as if you had shaken the cola bottle and you will get a large CO2 gas escape and not as much fizz/CO2 in the cola. This all assumes that the freezing didn't raise the CO2 pressure so high that some of the CO2 escaped while the bottle was frozen.</p>

"How can I use an eraser without smudging?","1174","","<p>I tried to figure out why some erasers can't do their job properly, and I ended up reading <a href=""http://pencils.com/erasers-dont-work/"">an explanation</a>. My erasers are not the most expensive, which probably accounts for their inefficiency.</p>

<p>However, I would like to know if there are tricks to properly use regular erasers in pencil marks, to avoid smudges left by graphite, while erasing any (or most) evidence of use. Ideally, precision would be useful too, to prevent from losing entire lines (to try to erase the smudges).</p>
","<p>Big fan of pencils for both office &amp; study as well as sketching &amp; artwork. Different erasers are designed to work with your particular pencil and paper selection, so there are a few issues to consider. </p>

<h3>Graphite Hardness and Erasability</h3>

<p>At the bottom of this post, I included a pencil grading test to show the effect of graphite hardness on how a pencil writes and erases. Generally speaking, softer leads are easier to erase, but they are also more prone to smudging (left-handed pencil users sometimes prefer harder leads for that reason). Harder H-grade leads are more smudge-resistant and give cleaner lines, but they tend to be more scratchy on the paper and are harder to remove once applied heavily enough to be easily legible. </p>

<p>The sweet spot between legibility and erasability is somewhere around the HB to 3H range (HB is your #2 pencil in the U.S. grading system &mdash; <a href=""http://pencils.com/hb-graphite-grading-scale/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Graphite Grading Scales Explained</a>). 2H is dark enough to be read clearly with minimal smudging while being easier to erase and correct mistakes.</p>

<h3>Choosing a Pencil</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vOe5s.png"" alt=""#2 pencil""></p>

<p>The Dixon Ticonderoga yellow #2 pencil has been the standard pencil of choice since our school days. But with three lead grades (B, HB, H) available, you may want to try a few different hardnesses to find the level that works best for you. </p>

<p>But here is my top preference.</p>

<h2><a href=""https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=Uni+Mitsubishi+9850+Pencil&amp;tbm=shop"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Uni Mitsubishi 9850 Pencil with Eraser - HB</a></h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sRhA2.png"" alt=""Uni Mitsubishi 9850 Pencil with Eraser - HB""></p>

<p>Many die-hard pencil fans swear by the <a href=""https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=Uni+Mitsubishi+9850+Pencil&amp;tbm=shop"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Uni Mitsubishi 9850</a> for its smooth, dark lines and general utility for office and study needs. What caught my attention was the high-quality eraser that erases pencil marks easily and reportedly does not harden (a leading cause of erasers becoming ineffectual over time). I found the eraser on this pencil surprisingly good and erases easily without smudges. </p>

<h3>Choosing an Eraser</h3>

<p>There is a lot of variability in eraser materials and effectiveness and what they are designed to erase. The most common pink variety (made of rubber) tend to smear and leave a residue while the pumice can be punishing to the paper (think math homework filled with holes). But if you want to stick to what you're going to find in your local grocery store, the Papermate pink erasers have gotten notably better in recent years. Just make sure you keep swapping them out for newer erasers, as older ones tend to dry out and lose their effectiveness egregiously. </p>

<p>Erasers also come in soft vinyl (plastic), art gum, and kneaded erasers that absorb graphite rather than rubbing it away. I've been partial to gum erasers made for sketching and artwork, but I've been itching to try some of the newer plastics or even this <a href=""http://www.jetpens.com/Sun-Star-Bode-Electric-Eraser-Black/pd/6004"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>battery-powered eraser</strong></a> that are reportedly extremely gentle on paper and meticulously exact. If you want to experiment with different materials, I would suggest the reviews at <a href=""http://www.jetpens.com/blog/a-guide-to-erasers/pt/597"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Guide to Choosing an Eraser</strong></a>&hellip; but if you want a one-stop solution, <strong>I would suggest the Uni Mitsubishi 9850 pencil I mentioned above.</strong> The pencil/eraser combination is surprisingly good. </p>

<h3>Precision Erasing 2.0</h3>

<p>You mentioned precision erasing to prevent you from losing entire lines when fixing up mistakes &mdash; from my aspiring graphic design and architecture days, I absolutely <em>love</em> these things:</p>

","<h3>Freeze it slowly</h3>

<p>The problem with freezers today is that they're just too fast. Still water doesn't have time to let all the air out before it's trapped in ice. By slowing it down, you can get clearer ice.</p>

<p>One way to do this is by changing the setting on your freezer. Use something very close to freezing, say -1C or 30F. For most freezers, this will be the warmest setting. The downside to this is that it will affect everything else in the freezer as well. If you have food in there you'd like to keep colder, this probably isn't the method for you.</p>

<p>Another way is by using something insulated. You can probably find a plastic or styrofoam cooler that will fit an ice tray (and fit in your freezer). Put your tray in it, and toss it in the freezer.</p>

<p>Both of these things will cause it to take <em>much</em> longer to freeze. The one time I tried the freezer temperature method, it took about 24 hours for it to completely freeze two trays, but they were nice and clear. </p>

<p>The cooler method probably takes longer, but I haven't tried that. I read online that a <em>good</em> cooler can keep water unfrozen for a few days. If that's the case, try it with the lid cracked a bit. This should speed it up some while still providing a good bit of insulation.</p>

<p>When most of the spiderweb has been removed you can use the duster or the item in your picture to remove the leftover bits, keep your dust sucker near to take care of cleaning the duster and/or the fallen bits of web.</p>

<p>For a real nasty situation, you can use your duster or your 'photo item' and cover them with an old panty hose, which will allow you to take off all spiderweb rests in one go. Take that hose off and bin it.</p>

<p>If available, also use a spare pair of eyes, as two see so much more than one. And if your helper is like mine, you take turns in cleaning and spotting, helping with the amount you need to do.</p>

<p>Very bad situations, like cleaning out where there are many live webs, the method of using a piece of wood will work well.<br>
It does not need to be wood, any stick shaped item that is long enough will work, if working outside a rough branch will be best. But inside a house with paint or wallpaper you should not touch the walls with something that is likely to leave tracks.</p>

What is the best and easiest way to pick up mercury drops from the floor?</p>
","<p>Mercury cleanup is <em>not</em> simple or easy. Though you can pick up the biggest droplets with a pipette (medicine dropper), <strong>do not use a vacuum cleaner</strong>, because it spreads the highly toxic mercury vapor throughout a room, or even a building.</p>

<p>The New York Department of Health has <a href=""https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/chemicals/hsees/mercury/cleaning_up_a_small_mercury_spill.htm"">an online guide</a>. In particular, after removing all droplets you can find, then rub powdered sulfur in the area of the spill, which will, over time, combine with mercury to form the less toxic mercury sulfide. The guide also lists sources for cleanup kits; Amazon carries a few for US$30 and more. <a href=""http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mercury/docs/Residential_Hg_Spill_Cleanup.pdf"">A guide may also be downloaded</a> from the US CDC.</p>

<p>The biggest danger is from long-term exposure to mercury <em>vapor</em>, or to organic mercury compounds that could be formed through bacterial action. Commercial hazardous waste specialists have <a href=""http://www.mercury-instrumentsusa.com/"">meters</a> to detect minuscule amounts of mercury vapor which can help track remaining particles in flooring. <strong>If the spill is large, definitely</strong> use professional cleanup service. </p>

","<p>If it's not too far back, a wire <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothes_hanger"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">clothes hanger</a> can be used. Locate the battery with a flashlight. Hold one end of the wire hanger, and push the other end of the hanger to the top of the fridge underside, until it has gone past the battery. Then let it down to the floor, and slowly draw it out. It will pull the battery with it.</p>

<p>Wire hangers work better for me because my fridge is low, so I'm less likely to push the item farther back with the hanger. If your fridge is high enough, I suppose a plastic one would work well because it would be less easy for the battery to slip out.</p>

"Help achieving real-time auto-tune effect","1078","","<p>A while back I played a video game with <a href=""http://saintsrow.wikia.com/wiki/Zimos_(character)"" rel=""nofollow"">a character who spoke entirely in auto-tune</a> (Warning: link is NNSFW: Not necessarily safe for work).  I thought it was a really fun idea and have been trying to replicate it in real life with varying degrees of success.  </p>

<p>I tried various programs and apps like Tune-Me or I-am-T-Pain, but nearly all of them require the user to record an audio snippet, process the audio then play it back.  This batch processing approach takes far too long and is cumbersome considering how much auto-tuning I plan to do.</p>

<p>My best attempt so far used <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jazarimusic.voloco&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">an android app called Voloco</a> to produce auto-tune without needing to process the audio in batches.  It works well, but there's a very noticable delay (~.5 seconds).  In practice this makes it nearly unusable because my voice isn't synced with the auto-tuned output.  Anyone nearby can hear my spoken voice separate from the auto-tune and it comes out like 2 people talking over each other (or rather one person singing over another).  </p>

<p>My plan is to have a battery-powered speaker hooked up to my phone which is hooked up to microphone.  I will have the phone somewhere away from my mouth (maybe in my pocket), the microphone next to my mouth or pinned on my shirt collar and the speaker(s) either mounted on my shoulders or in a backpack.  <strong>I've got everything working so far, but I need to mute myself from people who could be standing as close as 5 ft from me without preventing the microphone from picking up on my voice.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is my plan, but I welcome any advice or alternatives.  If someone has a way to achieve real-time auto-tune without all this I'm happy to take a look. </p></li>
<li><p>I want to use to speak to people close to me (5ft - 15ft), not auditoriums or across yards.  </p></li>
<li><p>I need to be able to carry the entire setup on my person.  I'm willing to use a backpack if necessary, but I'd much prefer a solution that could be stored entirely in my pocket(s)</p></li>
<li><p>Even though it will be disorienting, I don't mind hearing my own spoken voice as well as the auto-tune.  I really only care about the people around me.   </p></li>
<li><p>My only other restrictions are that I don't want to spend a lot of money (&lt;50$) and that I'm not really capable of doing any tricky electronics.  I can may be solder something without electrocuting myself, but passed that I'd need to get a professional.  </p></li>

","<p>I think the most compact way of doing something like this would be using a vocoder setting on a Korg Kaoss Pad. I'm not an expert on Kaoss Pads but I'm sure they have a vocoder patch. This takes one signal and modulates it with another, so you should be able to modulate the pitch of your voice with a tune either programmed in to the Kaoss Pad or from something like an external MP3 player. You would also need a microphone and some form of amplification, but it should be possible in much less space than a backpack. A good music shop would be able to tell you how get it working. You might also want to look up the term ""vocoder"" in your mobile device app store. Autotune is a brand name and is more of a studio thing than a real time performance thing. Autotune is really about changing the pitch to be right on the note. Mostly, it is meant to be unnoticeable, but Taylor Swift and countless other modern pop stars aren't fooling me. I think you might be looking for general vocal effect processing.</p>

<p>As for isolating your microphone, that really comes down to the type and quality of microphone and the environment you are using it in.</p>

"How to open a bag of rice sealed with string","1077","","<p>A 25kg/50lb bag of rice comes sealed with a string stitched along the opening. Short of cutting each stitch, is there an easier way of opening a bag of rice. I know there is a trick to untying a stitch and then it simply becomes a matter of pulling the string and it satisfying unstitches itself. Can some give a quick tip on how to do this.</p>
","<p>There is a ""right"" and a ""wrong"" side to start. Note that the seam is typically made with one string, which is exactly the reason it's so easy to unravel.</p>

<p>Look at the side with the <em>loops</em>. You'll notice the loops kind of ""pointing"" to one side. This is the side where you'll have to pull. In this case, to the left: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TjGvQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TjGvQm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now, look at the end of the string. Usually, there is <em>no unravelling loop yet</em> - which makes sense, considering the bags need to be shipped and handeled and should not open by accident. It's a bit hard to see, white on white, but here the end of the string keeps the last loop from unravelling.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L2aYS.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L2aYSm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Pull, and the bag opens.</p>

<p>Now, if you have trouble finding the right way to fiddle the end loose, you can also snip the string right at the end of the bag (again: the loops show you the correct side), freeing the last loop. Then pull <em>from the back side, where there is only one string visible</em>. Note the ""free"" loop at the edge of the bag:</p>

<p>My question is, how do they tell if the toilets are leaking? I did not see them because my family left the house for the day when he fixed it.</p>

<p>Things I have already tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking around for leaks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The plumber said to do this before he came, but I found nothing.</p>
","<p>The plumber may mean the toilet tank is leaking into the bowl through the flapper valve found at the bottom of most toilet tanks, at least in the USA. This is the most common toilet leak. </p>

<p>To test, you can place just enough colored drink powder, KoolAid mix,(preferably without sugar so as not to attract insects) in the toilet tank, do not flush, but wait 5 min. If the water in the bowl begins to change color, then the flapper valve is leaking.  This is a wasteful and possibly costly loss of water over time. </p>

<p>Flapper valves cost from $5.00 to $10.00 and are very easy to replace. Buy a good one. Many are guaranteed to last five years. It takes less than five minutes to change the flapper valve. All household toilet flapper valves should be replaced about once every five years.  Even a small leak can allow an amazing and expensive loss of water. Areas with hard water cause mineral buildup on the flapper valves, or the rubber becomes hard and the valves do not seat well over time.</p>

<p>If the leak is in the coupling or feed line to the toilet, or if in the water control mechanism, then it may still be a ""do it yourself"" job, but a bit more tricky, and wet. </p>

<p>If the toilet is leaking around the seal to the floor, then depending upon the age of the structure and installation, it may be a much more complicated job. Again, simplest resolution may be ""do it yourself"", more complicated could get into heavy plumbing and even carpentry or flooring work. </p>

<p>The next best question from you to the plumber is what part is leaking, and from where to where. Discuss that answer here or with your local hardware or plumbing merchant. Or come back here. Most all of us are familiar with toilets in one way or another. :)</p>

"More efficient way to arrange a CD collection","1003","","<p>I have a CD collection of around 500 albums. They are placed alphabetically by artist on around 10 shelves (shelves are vertically aligned one above the other, and are bounded on the sides). The first CD is on the top shelf in the leftmost position. The next CD is to the right of it. When a shelf is filled, the next CD goes on shelf below, again on the left. A nice and simple solution. Everything is already sorted, and I can find a specific CD really quickly this way.</p>

<p>The problem is that when I buy a new CD, I need to stick it in its correct alphabetical position. To make room for it (as the shelf is already full), I need to remove the rightmost CD from the shelf, and move that removed CD to the leftmost position in the next shelf.

","<p>There is <em>no way</em> you can keep them alphabetically sorted which doesn't require resorting (and/or reorganising) from time to time.

<p>My alternate solution has been to buy CDs, digitalising them, and then let my music player sort albums automatically. If you extend this with assigning a number to the CD when importing them, you could store them in sequential order, use the music player (of your choice) to sort the albums and play them, and get the cover for extra information by number if so needed.</p>

<p>Obviously, I do not want to be this charged. Not only because interpersonal reasons, but also because I work a lot with computers and electronics, so I do not want to harm any appliance I should be working with.</p>

<p>Is there a way to remove static from self?</p>
","<p>Any static charge gained in the dryer will be lost on the first grounded object you touch.</p>

<p>Your issue is due to subsequent build-up of charge, either from lack of fabric conditioner, which contains anti-static compounds, or you are regenerating more static from your interaction between shoes &amp; carpet.</p>

<p>For the first, use either commercially available anti-static dryer sheets; or even just a tightly screwed-up ball of aluminium foil in with the tumble-drying.</p>

<p>For the second, change your shoes. Leather soles create less static than artificial soles, though some artificial soles produce more than others. You'd have to test your existing shoes empirically to see which are best.</p>

<p>Also bear in mind that the entire effect is hugely influenced by atmospheric humidity, so don't think you've found the perfect solution on a rainy day.</p>

<p>Is there an effective way for me to set reminders in the distant future? </p>
","<p>Something tells me you have already forgotten this one so here are some tips to help you not forget again:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set an alarm on your watch/phone for the last month </li>
<li>Additionally set multiple alarms on your computer for the last month </li>
<li>Use one or two <em>online</em> calendars/reminders to notify you by email in the last month </li>
<li>Tell a friend to remind you of it in the last month </li>
<li>If you have some seasonal stuff you are <em>not</em> going to look at before the last month, attach a note to some of it. i.e. put a note on the Christmas decorations</li>
<li>Buy yourself a calendar and make big mark in it (and if you can't buy the 2016 calendar now, buy a 2015 calendar and make a reminder to buy a new one and to mark it) Place the calendar somewhere you'll keep looking at it </li>
</ul>

<p>If you implement some of or all of these, you should have a lot of different independent triggers where some of them, at least, should be able to warn you ahead of the deadline!</p>

<p>The main point I'm trying to make is not to put all your eggs (or  alarms so to speak) in the same basket. Using multiple triggers increases the possibility for you to be properly warned.</p>

<p>These packages are often labeled with personal information like billing and shipping address, phone numbers, and sometimes even email addresses. The labels stuck on these boxes and bags are hard to remove, and cutting them with scissors is usually too difficult.  These boxes and bags are sometime made of harmful plastics, so burning them  would not be good for the environment.</p>

<p>So what would be the good method to destroy the information or the packages themselves?</p>
","<p>What I use in these situations is a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00006IFIH"">Sharpie Magnum</a>.  </p>

<p>In my experience, these are fairly good at blacking out information on package labels. But you have to keep in mind that <em>most</em> of this information is fairly public and readily available (not to mention any package handler had access to it before it was handed off to you).  </p>

<p>You could always take an extra step and scratching bits of the labels off with a knife or scissors, but that's probably not necessary in most cases. If a bad guy was on the lookout to do harm to someone, the information they could get from a blacked out shipping label would likely not be worth their time anyway.  </p>

<p>Try to obscure (or even cut out, if you want to sacrifice convenience for security) parts that are most sensitive, then black out everything.  </p>

<p>In case you don't feel like buying a sharpie, I'm certain something like a nice coat of black spray paint would do the trick. But unless it's particularly sensitive information (which should never be on your package anyway. If it is, there are other issues here), worry more about making it inconvenient to retrieve, rather than impossible. Destroying a document is just on another level altogether.</p>

<li>Find something light that will float on it. The article speaks about a slice of a cork but you don't usually have that with you. I would rather use a leaf, some piece of paper (that won't soak too fast) or plastic, a very small piece of wood. It should be light and flat.</li>
<li>Get a metallic ""needle-ish"" thingy. Could be an actual needle, a watch needle, a belt buccle needle,... It should be metallic as you'll need to magetize it.</li>
<li>Magnetize the thing by rubbing it against an actual magnet, some fur, silk or even your own hair.</li>
<li>Put the needle on the floating thing. If you did well it will rotate until indicating a north-south direction.</li>
<li>Identify the North using any trick from other answers here. Technique in the article is more elaborate but technically if you happen to see the sun it's not that hard to figure out. Sun moves from east to west.</li>

<p>There are at least two reasons explained for this remedy which seems to be beyond logic. One is that the flies are not able to see the water bag as a water bag. Due to their structure of eyes, clear water filled bags are seen as something resembling a spider’s web by the flies. As such, they don’t come near such thing. The other reason states that the reflection of water is enough to disorient the flies and to create some unexplainable illusion to them. </p>

<p><strong>Get this</strong>:</p>

<p>Clear plastic bag (gallon size)-1</p>

<p>Water</p>

<p><strong>Do this</strong>:</p>

<p>Fill the plastic bag with water. Keep it halfway full with water.</p>

<p>Tie a knot at the mouth of the bag to secure it properly. You may also use a thread or a rubber band for the purpose.</p>

<p>So in general, what is your best winter clothing strategy for keeping warm?</p>
","<p><strong>Rule #0) Dress in layers.</strong> The rest of the rules won't work without this pre-requisite.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #1) Stay dry.</strong> Your outermost layer should block water but also be breathable so your sweat can escape. Your innermost layer should wick away water. Wool or polyester work well for that.  </p>

<p><strong>Rule #2) Keep out the wind.</strong> Your outermost layer should also block wind. Try to keep it tight where different layers meet. For instance, an elastic waist in a jacket helps keep the wind from billowing up underneath and circumventing the outer layer. Before you go out, stretch your arms around to make sure your wrists are waist aren't exposed.  </p>

<p><strong>Rule #3) Keep in the heat.</strong> Have a collar that blocks heat escape like an elastic band or scarf. Your middle layer should be insulating like wool, fleece, or even down.  </p>

<p><strong>Rule #4) Be mindful of changing conditions and ajust accordingly.</strong> If you're building up sweat, take off a layer or loosen it so you get better ventilation. If you start to feel cold somewhere, change something. Stand up if your butt gets cold. Pull your hands inside your sleeves or even all the way to your torso if you're losing feeling in your fingers. Go change your socks if your toes get cold.</p>

If the typical 70% rubbing alcohol isn't removing <em>everything</em>, try the higher concentrations (90%+ solution). The 70% solution works, but not quite as well as the higher concentrations. As a bonus, rubbing alcohol also removes <strong>permanent marker</strong> if someone should accidentally take one to your board or refrigerator instead of a dry erase marker. </p>

<h3>NOT Recommended</h3>

It's also a solvent and I've found it removed some of the smooth finish off my dry erase board (may not apply to your refrigerator), so the marker became hard to get off from then onward.

"Best Way To Sort Trading Cards","814","","<p>I have over 10,000 hockey cards that I am trying to sort and somehow put them on the computer. Is there any programs or scanners that can do this? If not what would be a fast way to enter them into the computer? Thanks</p>
","<p>Basically as I see it you have three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forget about it, and keep them sorted outside of the computer</li>
<li>Buy/acquire a duplex card scanner with automatic document feeder</li>
<li>Rig a camera with some sort of automated picture taking</li>
</ul>

<p>Although I do believe that the first option might be worth considering as this otherwise will be a time consuming event, I'll give some more details to the other two.</p>

<h2>Duplex card scanner with automatic document feeder</h2>

<p>If you want to scan that amount of cards, you need to make it somewhat automated, hence you need a scanner with automatic document feeder. In addition you don't want to load the stack twice to get both sides of the card, so you need a duplex scanner scanning both sides at the same time.</p>

<p>Lastly you don't want the cards to be bent too much, I assume, so you need to make sure that paper path of the scanner is as straight as possible. This rules out ordinary copy/printer/scanner multi-taskers as they tend to send the paper around rolls both to get it through the apparatus, but also to do the dual side scanning.</p>

<p>Therefore I would suggest looking/search for <a href=""//google.com/search?q=duplex+card+scanner+with+feeder"" rel=""nofollow"">duplex card scanner with feeder</a> or similar and see if you can't find something to suit your needs. And we don't do product recommendations on this site (Not, that I know a a particular product which does this well either).</p>

<p>Note that even with a document feeder, you'll most likely only be able to pass it up towards a 100 cards at a time, so it'll still take plenty of time. But if the scanner is good enough, you might get OCR (Optical Character Recognisition) as well, which would enable you to search textually through your cards afterwards.</p>

<h2>Rig a camera (or two)</h2>

<p>Another option, even more time consuming, would be to rig a camera and lights so that you put a card at a fixed place and then take a snap of it, either using a timer or a foot switch or some other kind of remote triggering device. </p>

<p>This is kind of like stop motion photographing, which can be used for this kind of endeavour as well. Advantage is that in this kind of setup you'll likely automate the transfer from the camera to the computer, and you'll have manually adjusted focus so it stays put, and you can automate any cropping of pictures as they all are in a fixed position.</p>

<p>Downsides is that you'll have to flip cards to get the backside (unless you rig a dual camera version, and put the card on a glass plate), and you'll have to manually go through all 10 000 cards, and if not doing anything fancy on the computer you'll only have a picture (and not text). Although it is possible to do OCR afterwards with images.</p>

Now wrap the wire around the metal bar as many times as you can, but leave a few inches so you attach the wire to the battery. Now put the ends of the wire on the battery and lock them into place with the rubber band. <em>Note: Most batteries will work. The bigger ones are more powerful, but make get hotter faster, so find a good balance.</em> This can get hot so handle with caution.

"How I prevent my computer from collecting dust?","743","","<p>Every time I open the casing (tower type) of my computer, I can see a lot of dust inside. The dust is often all over the blades of the fans.</p>

<p>As we all know, it is not a good practice to cover the vents. So is there a hack to prevent this and control the dust?</p>

<p><strong>My thoughts:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any chemicals which can attract dust? (As same as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica_gel"" rel=""nofollow"">silica gel</a> absorbs vapor) </li>
<li>Are there any dust resistant computed which can be applied on the surfaces that are exposed to dust?</li>
</ol>
","<p>You can use any type of textile from an old pair of tights to professional HEPA filters, as long as the surface is big enough to let a sufficient amount of air through. Therefore you could maybe create a long mesh tube, apply the filter material around it and roll it up in order to get the largest possible surface within the smallest volume.  </p>

<p>I think there is no way you can reduce the amount of dust by some chemicals, as they would have to get in direct contact with the dust particles. So smearing some glue onto the fan grid will not have much effect.<br>
But you could possibly increase the humidity in your room to reduce the amount of dust flying around. This however would also affect you yourself.</p>

<p>A possibly more effective but also dangerous idea of mine would be to build a box with two metal capacitor plates that can be charged with static electricity (you would have to buy some electronic parts and do some soldering). This would draw the dust onto the plates while the air passes by. However, you have to make a case around it that is connected to the ground to shield the outside from the electrostatic field. And you will have to put it in some distance to your machine, connecting them with maybe some kind of paper/textile tube with wires in it to make it keep its shape.</p>

<p>However, the easiest way is to buy some prebuilt dust filters. For example, there are filter panels with magnetic or adhesive tape to place directly onto the fan grids.</p>

"Homemade dehydrator without using the oven","734","","<p>I would like a dehydrator, but rather than spending a few twenties on a cheap one that's going to break after a couple uses, I would rather save up for one that lasts for years.</p>

<p>The only alternative I know of is to use the oven. The problem is that I would have to have the oven running for hours, and it's really overkill to run a large oven for a couple sticks of jerky or dried fruit.</p>

<p>Is there a different way to dehydrate food other than using the oven or a dehydrator? If so, how?</p>
","<p><strong>Methods I use:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use the sun. In the summer this is a popular method and can even be done indoors, try to avoid humidity, though. </li>
</ul>

<p>From <a href=""http://realfoodswitch.com/raw-food-equipment-reviews/dehydrate-raw-food-dehydrator/"" rel=""nofollow"">realfoodswitch.com:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you live in a warm climate or happen to have a very big sunny
  window you could sun dry your dehydrator recipes. Keep in mind that
  the sun may get hotter than the 112-120F degrees that is recommended
  for eating raw. However, if the option is to eat something deep fried
  or something sun dried I think the best option is pretty clear!</p>
  
  <p>One thing to watch out for using this technique is that animals and
  bugs may decide to have a bite or run off with some of your food.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Covering foods with nets, muslin or other light cloth works and watching them for being finished really helps. </p>

<ul>
<li>Use a toaster oven. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you already have one of those mini-toaster ovens then this is for
  you. If you’re planning on buying one for this – then just get an
  affordable dehydrator instead.</p>
  
  <p>This is how you should go about dehydrating raw foods in your toaster
  oven: place the foods you want to dehydrate on a plate or sheet in the
  oven. Set the toaster oven on the lowest possible setting, and prop
  the door open. At this point you may also want to put a fan in front
  of the oven so there is no water condensation taking place. This
  speeds up the dehydrating process and also makes sure your food won’t
  get soggy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""http://tacticalintelligence.net/blog/how-to-dehydrate-foods-without-a-dehydrator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">tacticalintelligence.net</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Use a fire. Grills, fireplaces, etc. Hang the food(placing to the side of the fire on a tray works to) about 6 inches or less above the fire, you should not use artificial woods as your food will then taste like them. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This method is best used for drying meats. Basically you’ll want to
  hang strips of meat on a rack and place these in front of a fire.
  Vegetables and fruits can be placed on the ground near the fire,
  however be sure that you are protecting the food from nearby critters.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Use the wind. This is the least favourable method as it takes longer and the food will have greater risk of spoilage. Meat should not be used by this method unless you use assistive devices(hair dyers, fans, etc) or have no other method. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Form a bag out of some netting (or use an existing netted bag) and
  place the food inside it. This is then hung from a clothes line or
  tree branch outside. This method also works inside the house in front
  of a fan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Using preservatives or treatments(lemon juice, etc) before drying helps prevent spoilage.</strong> Fire is usually the fastest method. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Additional Info</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>For meat:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The USDA’s] current recommendation for making jerky safely is to heat
  meat to 160 °F and poultry to 165 °F before the dehydrating process.
  This step assures that any bacteria present will be destroyed by wet
  heat. But most dehydrator instructions do not include this step, and a
  dehydrator may not reach temperatures high enough to heat meat to 160
  °F. After heating, maintaining a constant dehydrator temperature of
  130 to 140 °F during the drying process is important because: the
  process must be fast enough to dry food before it spoils; and it must
  remove enough water that microorganisms are unable to grow</p>

Now normally you would blow out a laptop using a compressed air can and I was wondering if there is a safe(not like using a vacuum with all the risk of static electricity) way to use the scuba gear to blow the laptop clean? </p>
","<p>While I wouldn't suggest using your expensive (and life critical!) SCUBA equipment for cleaning duty, if it's all you have, it'll work.  Scuba tanks are often pressurized to several thousand PSI, which is a hundred times more pressure than you want for blow gun use.  The regulators used in scuba diving bring this pressure down, often in two stages with two regulators.  The mouthpiece often contains the second regulator.</p>

<p>The first stage regulator, closest to the tank (often on the tank) brings the pressure down to a usable range for cleaning items using a blow gun, though it's still higher pressure than most home/shop air compressors, so you'll want to be careful, or adjust this regulator to a lower pressure output. If you have no other tools or extra hoses, simply disconnect the output hose of the first stage from the second stage/mouthpiece.  Turn the air tank valve to open and air will rush out the hose.  Keep a firm grip on the hose when the valve is open, even at these moderate pressures, a whipping hose with metal connectors on the end can cause significant injury.</p>

<p>Many first stage regulators have limiters to prevent air loss in case of leaks, but it should permit enough air for cleaning purposes - just don't expect to be able to run air tools continuously from this without a more suitable high flow regulator.</p>

<p>Also, letting the air out of a scuba tank quickly in this manner may result in condensation inside the cylinder which may eventually damage the cylinder.  It's really not a good use of life-critical SCUBA equipment, and particularly for high pressure cylinders. Make sure you inspect your tanks internally on a regular basis if you plan to use them for this purpose.</p>

"How to fry potato so that it becomes crispy without an oven or a fryer?","688","","<p>After cutting the potatoes I put them in boiling oil in a pan and then mix them while they get cooked, but it takes like an hour and they hardly become crispy.</p>

<p>I don't have an oven so all I can use is a stove. What can I do to make them crispy?</p>
","<p>We have crispy ""little fried potatoes"" every week with omelettes.  Chop the spuds the size of dice - important to get them all approximately the same size. Different potato varieties give different results/timings. Maris Piper are good. Microwave the diced spuds for 4 minutes in a bowl.  They come out a bit hot and sticky - separate them and add to a non-stick pan with plenty of hot oil over a medium-hot flame and keep turning them. About 6-8 minutes they will be crispy. After 10 minutes they can be TOO crispy/burnt, so watch the pan.  </p>

<p>At the crispy stage you can make instant ""patatas bravas"" by pouring off the excess oil, reducing the heat and adding a teaspoon of hot chili sauce plus as much tomato ketchup as you like to dilute the chili. </p>

"What is the least painful and most effective way to keep chest shaved?","681","","<p>Current state of the art for a defibrillator is to use pads with sticky (think duct tape sticky) in place of the hand held paddles we are used to seeing on TV.  </p>

<p>Without going into a lot of detail, I would like to keep my chest as free of hair as possible for a while.  </p>

<li>Shaving with an electric razor, I have been using a my three headed rotary razor, but it is not doing a super job, leaves a lot of stubble.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the most effective and least painful method of keeping a chest hair free, given that the standard methods (mentioned above) each have their own problems?</p>
","<p>I purchased a woman's electric wet/dry shaver, 3 Blade Foil Shaver. One of the blades is a trimmer that cuts longer hairs, the other two cut them short.</p>

<p>I had not shaved my chest in 3 or 4 days as dry shaving with the men's rotary was just not working. </p>

<p>I have used it 3 times now with good results.  Get in a hot shower, soap up the area to be shaved, and shave. The first time I had my glasses on, but this turned out to be unneeded.  There does not seem to be a risk of cutting your chest, and you can feel the area to see what needs more work. I did not do a side by side test, but the effectiveness of the wet foil shaver seems significantly better than the results of the dry shaving with the rotary.  </p>

<p>I am settling into a routine of shaving my chest every other day. If I survive the next occurrence of defibrillator pads, I will update this answer as to the effectiveness of shaved hairs not being pulled.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>With a chest that is shaved EKG leads attach to the skin better, they can removed without any discomfort. </p>

<p>Defibrillator pads applied at about 24 hours after shaving cause no pain when removed or repositioned.  There is much better contact and almost no burns (<em>4 defibrillation shocks</em>). I wore the pads for 48 without discomfort from hairs getting pulled with each move that was experienced last time. There are some marks but it is hard to tell if they are very minor burns or just aggravated skin from wearing the pads so long. When the pads where removed I was about 72 hours our from my last shave it seemed like the hairs were just starting to get long enough to stick to the pads, but still no significant discomfort on pad removal. </p>

<p>In summary: wet shaving with a electric shaver as described above every other day provides a nearly painless experience with defibrillator pads wear and removal. </p>

<p>Any way to reduce that effect, or eliminate it completely? </p>
","<p>Brass musical instruments are coated with clear lacquer to prevent contact with skin acids from corroding the metal -- and it's corrosion products left on your skin that you're smelling.  You should be able to eliminate the smell on your hands by thoroughly cleaning the brass on the top (soft scouring powder such as Bon Ami, a careful rinse, followed by rubbing alcohol or acetone to degrease the metal should be a good method), followed by coating the brass parts with clear nail polish.</p>

<p>This results in having to throw out these products.</p>

<p>How can we remove the fungi, or protect the food from it in the first place?</p>
","<p>The air and all surfaces around us are full of moulds, bacteria and yeasts. Thinking that you can totally avoid them on your food is not realistic. Often the products are already a tiny bit contaminated from the manufacturing and packing proces (however clean the factory tries to work). This is nothing to worry about as it will be very very rarely cause any problems. Other products like milk  will be sterilized of pasteurized to remove those contaminations.</p>

<p>As someone who makes all kinds of fermented foods on a regular base, I often contaminate food on purpose to start a fermentation proces. Yeast is added on purpose to you bread, beer and wine. Moulds are added to cheese and some meatproducts.</p>

<p>Often unwanted moulds on food products in our fridges are not very harmfull. But if you don't know for sure then throw it away.</p>

<hr>

<p>cheese:</p>

<p>White moulds on hard cheeses are most of the time eadible. If you don't want them, you can whipe them of with clean paper towel, wash them of with some brine or just remove the mouldy piece on your cheese and eat the rest.</p>

<hr>

<p>bread:</p>

<p>Most moulds on bread are pretty harmless to but the problem with bread is that it isn't easy to remove the moulds so trowing it away is the best solution.</p>

<p>Best way to store your bread is in a paper bag or a in a bread basket. You should noy leave them in the plastic bags that they come in. Often the bread is put in that bag when it's still hot. The steam coming of that bread will make the inside of the bag very moist and that will help moulds to grow.</p>

<hr>

<p>fruit and veg:</p>

<p>Fruit and veg often rot very locally. Most of the time, the part of the fruit/veg that in't rotting is eadible. So by cutting away the bad parts, you can still use it. </p>

<p>You should store fruit and veg in a dry place. A cool place will do nicely but don't put them in the fridge. Don't wash them before you put them away as it will speed up the rotting proces.</p>

<hr>

<p>meat:</p>

<p>Meat is something totally different. I make a lot of cure meats and I do at my my own risk. My advise is: if you don't trust it throw it away. Bacteria in meat can be pretty harmful ranging from some extra visits to the toilet to death.</p>

<p>If you handle meat (especially when you want to store it afterwards), always make sure that you kitchen is super clean and wash your hands every time before you touch te meat. Always store it in the fridge.</p>

<hr>

<p>Take special care with prepared foods. They are one of the mayor sources of food poisoning. Most of them will perish rare fast ranging from 2 days to a week (depending on how much preservatives are in it) keep the in the fridge at all times. </p>

<p>A good tip to avoid contaminations in you fridge is to put the dy goods on the top shelves and the wet and liquid goods on the lower ones. This way you can avoid contamination when something spills or drips.</p>

"Induction based fry pan not working on induction cooktop","607","","<p>For cooking on Induction cooktop, I recently purchased an <a href=""https://www.prestigesmartkitchen.com/omega-die-cast-plus-fry-pan-280-mm-with-heat-indicator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">induction based fry pan</a>, however the cooktop could not detect it, just beeping when the this new fry pan is placed on it. </p>

<p>This is troubling since if my cooktop cannot find the newly bought fry pan, I suspect other claimed induction cookware items from the linked store may not work either.</p>

<p>So,no case in purchasing any more new pans.  I mean, purchasing another fry pan is not a solution for me, infact I already ordered another pan, which I have already received.</p>

<p>Also, the induction cooktop detected and heated  efficiently another steel based container that I have, so the cooktop is working fine. </p>

<p>If anyone could suggest trick to make it work on induction based fry pan, I would be grateful</p>
","<p>The actual induction heating process will work with any conductive material -- steel, aluminum, copper, even gold (even salted water in a glass pot).  Your issue appears to be because the cooktop is failing to detect the pot.  This is a safety issue, to prevent things like heating a wedding ring if one lays a hand on an active zone (which could result in loss of the finger).</p>

<p>The pot you bought is probably supposed to have a steel insert in the bottom to accommodate the cooktop's detection system (otherwise, any aluminum pan will work with induction cooking).  You can check with a magnet to determine if you have a defective piece, and if so, you ought to be able to return it to the point of purchase for replacement.  Take your magnet with you, because it's likely that if one got through without the steel insert, many others did as well.</p>

<p>The same issue may occur with stainless cookware, because most stainless alloys are non-magnetic or only very weakly magnetic.  The piece you currently have linked in the question, however, is surely not stainless -- stainless can't be die-cast; that's a process that only works with lower temperature casting metals like zinc, aluminum, and their alloys.</p>

"Grey water reuse into back of toilet?","594","","<p>If I remember correctly, adding water to the back of the toilet storage tank will cause the level in the toilet to rise(after the next flush).  </p>

<p>I have a dehumidifier now, and am wondering about pouring the water it collects into my toilet's storage tank.  Not only would it save on water usage, but would reduce the stress on my septic tank.  The amount of water it collects is probably worth a couple flushes a day.  Admittedly it's pretty minor, but I can locate the dehumidifier near the bathroom and it becomes no more difficult to empty it into the toilet than it is to empty it directly into a drain.</p>

<p>I can either manually pour it into the tank, or setup a drain hose to automatically empty into the reservoir.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What will happen if I overfill the reservoir, either by pouring too much into it or via an automatic drain hose that might pump too much water?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can I adjust the bulb in the toilet in such a way that it fills the reservoir significantly less, so that it uses less water after a flush, since I will be replacing some of that with grey water?</strong>  Or is it not possible to make such an adjustment without screwing up the normal operation of the toilet?</li>
</ul>

<p>Note there are <strong>two concerns</strong> to overfilling:</p>

<ol>
<li>Could the reservoir overflow and flood out of the top of the reservoir and onto the floor? (with a continuous drain hose from humidifier)</li>
<li>Could the reservoir fill to a point where it does not overflow, but on the next flush it overflows the toilet?  Sometimes my toilet clogs but it doesn't overflow as long as you only flush it once and clear the clog before flushing again.  I want to be sure the reservoirs are designed such that it's impossible to fill them to a point where the next flush would overflow the toilet.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think one of the vertical pipes in the toilet is open on top to allow overflow to drain out.  Will this prevent both of the potential scenarios?</p>

<p>Note, this information would be useful to others who might want to create a DIY grey water reuse scenario that is similar to the continuous drain scenario.  Perhaps having the drain from a second story sink feed into the reservoir of the first story toilet.</p>
","<p>Normally, the reservoir has an overflow pipe that would prevent both your concerns. The reservoir is set up so it normally fills to just below the level of the overflow, so you would have to adjust the bulb to get enough room for your dehumidifier water.<br>
The adjustment range depends on the exact design of the reservoir. </p>

"How can I dim the 20+ LEDs that are in my room to help with sleep?","592","","<p>I'm aware that as little as 200 lumens of light is enough to disrupt sleep in sensitive individuals. <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23675/would-constant-light-or-fading-light-be-registered-as-more-wakefulness-promoting?noredirect=1#comment67370_23675"">Blue light in 460-480nm wavelength is especially powerful for disrupting sleep via reducing melatonin secretion</a>. </p>

","<p>Two immediate thoughts comes to mind: 1) Move the equipment out of the room, 2) Improve on your dimming idea.  Assuming it's not an option to move the equipment out of the room, I'll suggest some other options to dim the lights.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Use thicker not so semi-transparent tape</em> – Depending on whether you at any time need to see the lights or not, you could opt for black electrical tape, or multiple layer of semi-transparent tape, or a colored tape which would limit the transmitted light</li>
<li><em>Turn the equipment around</em> – Direct light is worse than indirect light, so if it is an option to turn the equipment around somehow, so that you don't face the lights directly, that would be better</li>
<li><em>Use hot glue on top of the lights</em> – Hot glue is a dark variant off semi-transparent, and if done properly it will just be a little extra bulb on top of the other light. Especially for some LED diodes this could be a viable solution. Do however take into consideration, that this <em>might</em> violate your warranty, and is somewhat more permanent than using tape</li>
<li><em>Use an automated timer to shut off equipment at night</em> – Most likely you are not going to use most of the equipment at night, so don't rule out shutting them down during the night time. This can be done using an automatic timer (or a remote control timer), or possilby a master-slave power outlet. </li>

"How to clean my iron so that it won't leave brown spots on my clothes?","592","","<p>When I press the steam button, brown juice is getting out of my iron (I suppose salts with water?), soiling the clothes that I try to Iron. The bottom part of the iron is clean but it seems that there is something inside that needs cleaning.
What part of the iron do I have to clean and how?</p>
","<p>The brown coming out with the steam is mainly due to rust in the steam passages.  Given the price of a new iron, the sensible way to deal with it is to replace the iron and use only distilled or reverse osmosis filtered water in the new one, to prevent recurrence.</p>

<p>If that's not a viable option for some reason, it might be possible to soak the iron's steam system with a rust remover.  I think it's unlikely you'll find anything that will take rust out of the steam passages that won't itself stain clothes.  Mechanical cleaning would require something similar to a pipe cleaner, but thin enough to push through the steam passages (which are far from straight, to hold the water inside the sole plate as it heats and boils).</p>

<p>Another option (one we used when I was a child, forty-plus years ago) is to keep the iron dry, but spray a light mist of water directly on the clothing as you iron.  You can use tap water for this in most locales, because the solids in the water won't get concentrated by repeated boiling in the iron's sole plate (but test first on a piece that's already got stains; if you have high iron content in your water this can also cause problems).  This last also works with a dry iron (one without steam passages), which is how I recommend using it if you decide to replace the iron.</p>

<li><p>Try not to touch your lips or mouth with anything. Keep even water bottles away from your mouth. Your mouth will dry out faster if you rub all the moisture off.</p></li>
<li><p>Buying a candybar and rubbing that across your lips should help. The bar has less irritating salt. Candy bars with gooey centers or chocolate outsides(plain chocolate, etc) help more than hard shelled candies, like M&amp;M's.

Make sure to avoid bright dyes(like blue, orange, red, etc) that coat the candy and ingredients that you can't eat. </p></li>

"How do I make my smartphone battery last longer?","561","","<p>My phone battery lasts often less than 3 hours. <strong>How do I get more life out of it?</strong></p>

<p><em>FYI, it's a 3 year old Apple iPhone 5.</em></p>
","<p>A few things I always do to try and preserve my battery life:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce Brightness</strong><br>
I always have the brightness as low as possible while not having to strain my eyes to see the screen - the dimmer the screen, the less power it uses. <strong><em>Also turn off auto brightness</em></strong> as this usually takes more battery than needed.</li>
<li><strong>Turn off WiFi and Bluetooth</strong><br>
Always have these off when not in use (i.e.  out and about) as it will always be looking for a connection when not connected which will take more power.</li>
<li><strong>Put in Airplane Mode</strong><br>
If you are in a WiFi zone and you do not need cellular network (i.e. all messages are through iMessage or whatsapp or others) and you have no need for calling people, you can just connect to the WiFi network while not using your phones network which would draw more power than necessary if it's not needed. This will also help the phone to charge more quickly when you are trying to recharge the battery.</li>
<li><strong>Turn off Location Services</strong><br>
Make sure than none of your apps are using your location while not in use (even while in use if you don't need them too) this can be configured in your settings and the less location services being used, the less power you'll consume, thus preserving battery life.</li>
<li><strong>Do Not Disturb</strong><br>
Put it into do not disturb mode as this will stop it vibrating or going off if you get messaged - unless you always need to know when you receive a message.</li>
<li><strong><em>Don't</em> Close Apps</strong><br>
Force quitting all your apps regularly can actually be more power consuming so this method of battery saving is a total myth. <a href=""http://vimeo.com/34660348"">There's a video about it here with more detail</a> but in short - unless the apps are doing any of a few specific tasks, the phone suspends the task until it is re-opened, this means it uses zero processing cycles which means basically no power usage.</li>
<li><strong>Don't let it overheat</strong><br>
I used to find my iPhone would get very hot when playing games or watching videos and this would reduce battery performance so if you ever find the phone getting hot then perhaps stopping what you are doing would be a good idea in order to improve battery life.</li>
<li><strong>Don't fetch emails</strong><br>
If your phone checks for new emails every so often you can turn this off or reduce the frequency of it in order to conserve battery - turning fetch off will mean you have to go onto the emails before it will look for new messages.  </li>
<li><strong>Turn off Parallax</strong><br>
This fun new feature from the update last year does cause your battery to drain more than it needs to, so unless you're totally in love with this feature then turn it off.</li>
<li><strong>Don't auto-update apps</strong><br>
This will firstly use a lot of data and will also draw lots of power when updating apps so only do this when you have a WiFi connection and you have a power source nearby.</li>
<li><strong>Turn it off</strong><br>
If you are not going to be using your phone for a long time then turning it off would be a great power saver as it will reduce the battery consumption to near zero which is naturally very good. Also turning it off while charging will help to charge it more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Recharge <em>ONLY</em> when needed</strong><br>
Avoid putting the phone on charge while it still has a fair amount of battery remaining, doing this actually reduces the amount of charge it is able to hold so allowing the battery to get down to a lower percentage (>10-20%) would be better before you connect it to power.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can always check what is using the most battery if you go to <strong>Settings</strong> -> <strong>General</strong> -> <strong>Usage</strong> -> <strong>Battery Usage</strong> and then you can think about using that feature less or getting rid of it completely.<br>
One thing to keep in mind is that the most power consuming thing is having the screen on, so having it off as soon as you stop using it and not checking it every 5 seconds will help big time.</p>

"How should I re-attach the top sheet of paper that has come loose from a stapled group?","560","","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>At school, I receive a lot of thick paper packets that are 40 or more pages long. Our printer automatically can staple packets of up to around 150 sheets, so the packets are stapled nicely together.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, after a few days of using the paper packet, the front page begins to tear off, which makes it very annoying to use. I can staple the front sheet back on with a normal stapler, but our staplers only staple around 25 papers, so it doesn't go all the way through, and falls off after another day.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is there any simple way to reattach the front page of a stapled paper packet without stapling all the way to the back page?</p>
","<p>Don't try to staple it all the way through the packet.</p>

<p>First, reinforce the torn corner. I usually use post-it notes and tape, which <strong>do not</strong> last long-term if it gets a lot of use. If you need to use these packets for a while, you might want to use paper tape.</p>

<p>Second, staple the front sheet to the next set of sheets, anywhere from 5 to fifteen pages. Either staple it as close to the original staple as you can, or along a natural fold point if that's not practical. Preferably use more than one staple in more than one position - moving the paper around while attached to as single staple is what caused the problem in the first place. So if the original staple was in the top corner, either place two parallel staples a little farther ""in"", or two to three staples across the top or along the side. It's not a great long-term solution, but it should last a few weeks if you're careful.</p>

<p>Proactively, when you first get the packet reinforce the first page <strong>across</strong> the staple with something that flexes well (such as duct tape), and over the crease lines at the edge of the paper. If it's a top corner staple, for example, take a piece of duct tape a little over an inch square and put it over the paper and staple, then wrap the edges over the sides of the paper (you can cut a small bit off the corner of the tape to prevent overlap).</p>

"How to make non-drinkable seawater drinkable?","560","","<p>I've read about <a href=""https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/2895/1780"">desalination and reverse osmosis systems on the large scale</a>, but sounds like it's complex, very energy-intensive and expensive process.</p>

<p>But how can you make it on a smaller scale e.g. at home? Are there any life hacks?</p>
","<p>Quite a simple method that would get rid of any salt in the water is to simply boil the water and collect the condensed water vapor in a separate cup / container.</p>

<p><strong>Things you would need:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Saucepan with a lid</li>
<li>A clean glass / Pyrex cup or jug</li>
<li>Sea / salt water</li>
<li>A stove or fire</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Steps to 'de-saltify' the water:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Place the cup in the middle of the saucepan (or wherever the highest point on the lid of the pan is) you will need to have a small enough glass that will fit in the pan with the lid on!</li>
<li>Pour in your seawater - try not to go to close to the rim of the pan to avoid spillage, and also avoid making it close to the height of you glass as this might cause sea water to enter which will contaminate the new fresh water</li>
<li>Place the pan / cup / water combo onto a stove or a sturdy grill above a fire (hot enough to boil water) and apply heat</li>
<li>Place the lid onto the pan and wait!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The heat from the flames will cause the seawater to boil and thus evaporate, salt in the water is too heavy to evaporate with the water so is left behind.</li>
<li>The water vapor then rises up in the pan until it reaches the lid where it tries to escape and heads to the highest point of the pan.</li>
<li>Here it will be unable to escape and will condense as the lid will be cool enough to bring the vapor below boiling temperature and the condensed water will fall into the glass below leaving you salt-free water!</li>
</ul>

<p>I managed to find a site that explains it in a different way that might be more clear and comes with some fun videos if that gets your blood pumping, here: <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Turn-Salt-Water-Into-Drinking-Water"">WikiHow</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> You will have to try and keep the lid down as the pressure might cause it to bounce around and allow some of the steam to escape!!!  </p>

<p><strong><em>Note 2:</em></strong> This will not disinfect the water if you are actually getting it straight from the sea there will be lots of bacteria in the water which won't be eradicated by this simple process - hence the super expensive purification process in your examples!!!</p>

However, instead of 3 bolts each for connection, I only have 2, so the bed shakes a lot and sometimes breaks apart in the middle of the night. What I have done is put a large enough crate (beer crate) in between the frame and the wall, but it is temporary. What can I do to make the bed more stable?</p>

<li>Place the bed firmly against the wall and place anything heavy like a a set of drawers to the foot end of the bed.</li>
<li>If you are able to buy a cheap hammer and some nails, get some very long ones and hammer them in around the joints.</li>
<li>I'm assuming you mean wooden dowels are being used, reinforce them by pulling them out of the holes, stuffing newspaper in the hole and use super glue (if you have any) to bind the dowels into the holes.</li>
<li>Using 4 pieces of rope, tie the bottom of the left legs, from the head to the foot end to each other..very tightly, do the same for the right. If you have one of the wooden beds where the headboard has vertical slats, tie another piece of rope from each corner of the headboard, tuck down to the legs of the head end, run along the base and tie to the foot end.</li>

"How can I shave my back?","558","","<p>I have hair on my back. How can I shave it? Preferably by myself.</p>

<p>I'm flexible, but not <em>that</em> flexible - trying to make sure I get all of it is a real struggle.</p>
","<h2>Choose a proper tool</h2>

<p>To me the key issue here is not actually doing the shaving, but seeing what needs to be shaved. I have used an electrical rotary razor with a trimmer section, and I've been content using the trimmer section. </p>

<p>However as indicated in <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/a/2370/4490"">this answer</a>, it could be well advised investing in <em>a woman's electric wet/dry shaver, 3 Blade Foil Shaver. One of the blades is a trimmer that cuts longer hairs, the other two cut them short.</em>  These could possible have a better handle on hair attached to a chest or the back.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to use a manual razor on my back, and don't foresee how it can practically be done. Using an electrical razor gives you so much more leverage when it comes to reaching those hard to get places.</p>

<h2>Using mirrors</h2>

<p>I tried different setups with mirrors, and the one working best for me was to stand with my back against a wall mounted mirror, and then have another mirror, either hand held or fixed in a tripod. In one case I had the luck of using a mirror inside the cupboard reflecting onto the wall mounted mirror.</p>

<p>Either way I look into the small mirror to see the reflected image in the wall mounted mirror. The point being that it is easier to move/manouver the small mirror to see the correct section of your back, rather than first looking in the largest mirror and then finding the sector you are shaving.</p>

<h3>Alternative: Using camera phone?</h3>

<p>I haven't tried this my self, but you could possibly use a camera phone, web cam, or video camera which has a live feed, and then watch your back on a large screen whilst shaving.</p>

<hr>

<p>When shaving take your time and let the razor do it works, just concentrate on moving it somewhat regularly up, down, sideways, which ever way you need to in order to cover the back.</p>

<p>Most people does actually have the dexterity to reach most part of the back when using both hands, and shift positions from over the shoulder to going around and up the back. And this is easier if holding an electrical razor which gives you that little extra in length to reach all over.</p>

<p>It feels awkward moving/shaving in a mirror, and it does take a little bit of practice as you tend to move the wrong way a lot. But it gets the job done, without to much hassle. </p>

<li>peanut butter</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put a small dab of peanut butter on the inside of the roll on one end.</li>
<li>Place the roll so that the end with the peanut butter is hanging over a counter (balanced over the edge)</li>
<li>Place the trash can underneath the open edge of the roll.</li>
<li>You may need to glue a small weight on the end of the roll depending on how short or long it is to act as a counter balance.</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea is that the mouse will smell the peanut butter and try to reach it through the roll. It has enough balance to stay by itself, but once the mouse reaches over the edge, it and the roll will fall into the trash can.</p>

","<p>The standard first rule of cleaning optics is: Don't!</p>

<p>Cleaning with an abrasive like toothpaste is far more likely to render the lens evenly ""milky"" due to putting fine scratches all over it.  Further, the ""lens"" you can touch is actually an optical flat cover that protects the actual lens, and in many phones and tablets it's made of synthetic sapphire -- so the only thing likely to be scratched, or vulnerable to your polishing attempts (short of using powdered diamond on an optical lap) is the coating.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that any photo quality issues you may see are due to individual scratches on the cover, in any case; it's far more likely that the focusing mechanism (probably a piezoelectric unit behind the sensor chip) is malfunctioning, a setting in the camera software is wrong, or there's junk on the sensor itself.</p>

<p>The keyring in the photo above is an extreme example of their ability to destroy clothes: The smaller ring has bent ever so slightly, causing the one end to easily insert itself into all sorts of fibrous materials and tear them apart with glee. </p>

<h2>Potential solutions</h2>

<h3>Avoidance</h3>

<p>Of course, the best way to solve a problem is to avoid it, but there are some cases where this is not feasible: For example, although you could keep their keys in a bag instead of in their pocket, when you take them out to use them and happen to be wearing knit gloves because it's ridiculously cold (so cold that you would never want to take off your gloves just to use your keys), you can easily snag your gloves on the keys and then ruin them.</p>

<h3>""Snag-proofing""</h3>

<p>Now, I could theoretically just replace this ring with a thicker one, but thicker ones can do it as well (albeit not as frequently). In some cases, I've also simply put some electrical tape over the ring so that it no longer has any sharp edges, but then I can no longer quickly take the rings apart (I would have to cut off the tape and then re-apply it), which destroys one of the main advantages of such a design.</p>
","<p>Use a thicker, better quality ring to replace the smaller ring. The wire type key ring holder is meant for quick attachment of keys to a tag, not long term use in a pocket. You can find an assorted set of sizes in a package at almost any hardware store.</p>

Also any tips on how to avoid it going yellow in the first place would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Her natural hair colour is brown and the dye is mainly to touch up the roots as they come through over time - professional salons are so expensive and to be honest don't do that great of a job!</p>
","<p>There's no 'hack' answer I'd suggest, other than the relatively safe but probably, in this case, totally ineffectual application of neat lemon juice left on for a while. I'd advise caution though - sometimes, dyed blond can start to look green when other chemicals are applied (chlorine being the obvious one, but chemical reactions are possible even with lemon juice, so its hard to predict the outcome).</p>

<p>If its orangey yellow, it means the product you used is not powerful enough to 'lift' the basic hair colour, or you didn't leave it on long enough. Any hair colour containing peroxide is very efficient at creating blond, but again, the results vary according to how long its been left on;- too short a time and it'll be orangey yellow, too long means the hair will start to degrade, becomes fragile and starts to break. If the product you bought came with something to apply after the colour, that's probably a toner, which is meant to knock out any yellow/orangey tones - if that didn't do the trick, then it's likely nothing is going to.</p>

<p>You could, though, try a 'silver' shampoo, such as L'Oreal Professional Silver - its purple when applied, but will brighten dull blond hair and does reduce yellow/orange tones. If that doesn't help, the hair colour needs to be corrected, preferably by a professional.</p>

<p>Maybe it sounds useless, but imagine if you're living in the big house with big family and many bathrooms, so you need some solution to inform you which toilet is run out of the toilet paper to avoid additional headache.</p>

<p>If there was some perfect way or invention for detecting shortage of the toilet paper, I'm sure it can help over 150k hotels (or around 20 million toilets) around the world. And in the perfect world it can be simplified to the receptionist who could see the red lights (indicating the shortage) and send the house keepers, before the guest would even realise.</p>
","<p>Why not to install an alarm to trigger when the toilet paper is low?</p>

<p>Either by installing color based optics sensors (usually cardboard tubes are brown) by using standalone electronics as below:</p>

<p>Or by installing weight sensor by using potentiometer which will trigger when your roll is low as shown in the below diagram:</p>

"Replacement For Slow Cooker","484","","<p>I bought a cookbook a few hours ago and I have just realized that I need a slow cooker. I don't have one and I do not have the money to buy one (I'm saving up money).</p>

<p>What is a good replacement for a slow cooker?</p>
","<p>Use the oven. It should have a thermostat so you can control the heat going to your pot. Also, with an oven you get even heat around the pot/vessel, rather than on a stove (bottom heat only). Just make sure the handles can handle the temperature you desire. Most pots have handles that can cope with slow-cook temps easily.</p>

"How can I improvise sunglasses?","481","","<p>Where I live it's usually cloudy and rainy during the winter, so I rarely have my sunglasses with me.  But when the sun does come out after it's been raining (we call this a ""sun-break"") the glare of the sun against the wet pavement is blinding.</p>

<p>How can I improvise a pair of sunglasses?  Wearing a cap or squinting doesn't work.</p>
","<p><strong>Two ways of improvising sunglasses</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Make Slit Sunglasses</strong></p>

<p>Slit sunglasses work by limiting the upper and lower angles of light coming into your eyes.  </p>

<p>To improvise these glasses you can use the cover of a paperback book, plastic cards or some other stiff but bendable material. Make the slits with a penknife. The nose and earpieces can be constructed of string, rubber bands, twist ties or the material itself.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNgj6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>2. Make Pinhole Sunglasses</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_glasses"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pinhole sunglasses</a> work by limiting the total amount of light that come to your eyes. However, due to the pinhole effect you still have a full field of vision, although you may have some visual artifacts where the two visual fields meet.  Pinhole glasses also have the advantage of correcting your vision, also thanks to the pinhole effect.</p>

<p>You can make pinhole glasses out of the same material as slit sunglasses and use a safety pin or bit of stiff wire to make the holes.</p>

"How do I determine the fastest speed to drive without getting a ticket?","480","","<p>The speed limit may say one thing, but no one ever drives the speed limit. Where I drive most of the time I know what tolerances are in place. If I drive in a less familiar location, such as when visiting family, I do not know how tightly speed limits are enforced. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the best way to establish how fast I can drive without getting a ticket?</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>While I would advise just simply sticking to the speed limits put in place for yours and others safety, there are a a couple of tricks I've picked up which work at least in the UK!</p>

<p>Speed cameras have tolerances that are in place in order to stop people getting tickets when in fact they're travelling below the speed limit. After all it costs a fair bit for the authorities to distribute tickets and costs them even more if it gets disputed and thrown out, so it's in their interest to have accurate speed cameras!<br>
The tolerance that I have learned to go by is about 10% over the actual speed limit as I've heard that this is the possible error that a speed camera could present when measuring speed.</p>

<p>A second point of interest is that car speedometers aren't actually all that accurate either, displaying slightly higher than you are actually going (this figure I was once told was +2mph) and if you've ever traveled with a sat nav in the car which shows speed, you'll have seen that the cars displayed speed is a fair bit higher than the reading on the sat nav. I have subsequently found out that the sat nav reading is actually the more accurate of the two (which I refused to believe for a long time) so if you're using one of those you can always ignore your own speedo and go with what that is saying.</p>

<p>Even with all these measures I still change my speed depending on the road conditions and situations that I am in. If it's an empty motorway then I'll happily go 90-100mph unless there are speed cameras around at which point I will slow down to just over the speed limit (+5-10 mph) and I'll usually slow down a bit when passing other vehicles (just in case of unmarked police cars) as if you're caught going over 100mph (or twice the speed limit) you'll instantly lose your license and will be taken to court so I save those speeds for solo drives on lonely roads.</p>

<p>After all that I would still just simply advise staying to whatever you're comfortable with, if you're going to break speed limits you've got to be prepared to risk getting a speeding ticket and to be honest sometimes people can just be outright idiots and deserve lose their license.</p>

<p>Anyways, that's the work around a I use and have never got a ticket or anything but as I said, I live in the UK and I'm unaware of it is applicable internationally but it might be of use to you.</p>

","<h1>Warm the knife</h1>

<p>Ever heard the phrase ""like a hot knife through butter""? Warm the knife by dipping it in hot or boiling water, and the butter will be easier to spread because it is warmed on the knife.</p>

<h1>Pre-spread the butter</h1>

<p>Take some butter and use the knife to spread it about a bit on the inside of the lid of the butter container. (If it's <em>really</em> hard, start by squashing it with the knife.) Then scoop it up and spread again. After a few repeats the butter should be soft enough to spread on your bread.</p>

<p>You can see a (short - 37 seconds) video demonstrating this technique <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW2zimEKrgY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is the technique I personally use and it works great. I actually use the block of butter itself to spread on, rather than the inside of the lid, but either works.</p>

<h1>Use a cheese grater</h1>

<p>Graters are designed for grating harder objects, like cheese. They work perfectly on hardened butter, and the grated strands of butter are thin enough that they can be easily spread afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Plan B would cost a lot but lower the risk... and unfair</strong></p>

<p>and that is buying a repeater and install it at the center of the hallway. </p>

<p><strong>Plan C is 50 50</strong></p>

<p>and that is make an antenna that runs in battery's. but I don't know how to make one like a biquad wifi antenna.</p>

<p>I think using reflectors would be fun. any idea?</p>
","<p>A reflector would be difficult to get right. A parabola at the location you've drawn does not help: it'll just increase the interference. A parabola only works if the transmitter is in the focal point of the parabola. </p>

<p>Making an antenna that runs on batteries isn't going to work either. You'd need to build a repeater. This is a radio transmitter, and you need a decent background in electronics to build one that works instead of making the situation worse. It'd be easier and cheaper just to buy a repeater instead. </p>

<p>A cantenna is a possible solution, because you can set this up at the receiver side. You'd have to buy an external Wifi receiver, and connect this to the cantenna and your computer. Or instead buy an external wifi receiver with a good antenna. But this has to be done for every computer in the '2nd target' area. </p>

<p>A repeater (also known as a range extender) is the easiest to set up. You can buy range extenders <a href=""https://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-range-extenders/EX6100.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">that do not need to be connected to the router</a> (random repeater linked for reference): they receive the signal from the router, and transmit it again on another channel. Place the repeater near 'target 1'.<br>
Repeaters are common items, and can be bought for about <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B006ZIGP50"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">US$7</a>-50.</p>

<p>You can build your own repeater using 2 wifi access points, or with a computer with 2 wifi cards (1 internal, 1 USB, for example). If you use a Windows computer, I think you can use the built-in 'connection sharing' to extend the network through the second wifi card.</p>

"How to effectively remove cat hair from clothes (e.g. T-shirts) of thin cotton?","436","","<p>I was told several times that the most effective way is simply to move my wet hand (palm) over the cloth (and cat's hair will be on the palm).</p>

<p>But in my case it's not true. Maybe, because in my case the cloth is thin (I prefer thin T-shirts, socks, etc) and cat's hair is relatively long, so it often gets deeply inside the cloth, literally penetrating it (or, at least, hardly clinging to it). Washing machine doesn't remove cat hair too.</p>

<p>Currently I end up with explicitly removing hair fibers with my fingers one-by-one. Any ideas? (Details, if needed: we have two cats, one short-haired and one long-haired.)</p>
","<p>We also have a cat, so I'm speaking from experience:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Prevention - you don't need to get off what didn't get on your clothes in the first place.</p>

<ul>
<li>Brush your cat regularly. If he's not used to it, start with just a few strokes with a brush while petting him and reward his patience, e.g. with a small treat. Every hair that's in a brush won't get shed elsewhere. 
If you have a cooperative outdoor cat, brushing outside is even better.  </li>
<li>Vacuum regularly. Not only the floors, but also the places you and your cat share, like the sofa. Sitting on cat hair causes them to get embedded in the fibers of your clothes.</li>
<li>Some people swear by fabric softener to reduce electrostatic effects and thus less ""clingy"" hair. As I personally don't use it, I can not confirm its effectiveness, but at least for fabrics with partly synthetic fibers it sounds logical.</li>
<li>Avoid embedding cat hair into the fibers as much as possible, so make your wardrobe / closet / laundry basket / pile of clothes... off-limits for your feline companions. Once they sleep on the clothes, they'll literally ""rub the hair in"".</li>
<li>Do not wash clothes with cat hair on them. It might be tempting to ""have the washer and dryer deal with them"", but usually it causes them to get ""felted"" onto and into your t-shirt. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Removal - a mix-and-match set of methods I used in the past.</p>

<ul>
<li>For copious amounts of hair (think shedding season), shaking out the shirt (outside!) will be a first step.</li>
<li>If you use a lint roller or other tool, I find it easiest to use it while I wear the shirt. It seems to stretch less than when placed on a table or ironing board. Plus I don't want to spread cat hair everywhere. But in the long-term, they can be pretty pricey. I mostly use them for a quick touch-up. </li>
<li>There are re-usable lint rollers on the market that have a permanently sticky rubber surface that can be rinsed off. They work reasonably well (but are less ""strong"" than the ones with tape), but are not suitable for large surfaces.</li>
<li>Similar to the sticky rollers are rubber gloves. Not the thin chirurgical ones, but simple household gloves. Get them slightly damp, then wipe down your clothes. The hair should form little ""rolls"". Rinse the gloves as necessary.</li>
<li>A very ""hacky"" approach is packing tape - and very cheap. Wrap some round your hand, sticky side out, then use it like a lint roller. What's nice is that you can somewhat adjust the strength by pressing harder or less hard, whatever fits your use case. And your hand will mold better to your body-shape than a rigid roller, so you need less going back-and-forth. Note that the ""stickiness"" can vary between brands, so some experimentation may be in order. Don't use duct tape or similar, especially for thin fabrics!</li>
<li>Note that no tool or method will remove every single hair. You live with cats, that also means cat hair. You can drastically lower the amount, but if you really want to get rid of every single hair, there will always be a few that must be plucked off individually.</li>
</ul></li>

"Easy way to remove brand stickers in recyclable materials?","434","","<p>I love to recycle materials but most of the time I have a hard time removing the brand stickers on them. For example, I've finished eating the peanut butter and I'd like to use the peanut butter bottle for other purposes. What is the easiest way to remove the brand sticker on that bottle?</p>

<p>The things that I've tried so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Manually and carefully remove the sticker on the peanut butter bottle - This is very time consuming and if you tear the sticker it will be difficult to remove it neatly.</li>

","<h2>Method 1: Boil</h2>

<p>I've soaked some wine bottles in boiling water for 30 minutes and the labels just fell off.  Some I had to scrub off the residual glue with a scouring sponge, or scrape with a plastic putty knife.  <strong>Edit:</strong> Some plastics warp when boiled.</p>

<p>What can I wear/do so I can stay cool after taking a shower in an extremely hot place?</p>
","<p>If you are exerting yourself during your swim lessons, then your body temperature is elevated when you get out of the pool and you'll be sweating even though you don't feel it while you're in the pool.  You need to lower your body temperature before you put your clothes on.  There are two ways I've used to cool off before getting dressed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the pool temperature is typical (around 80 degrees F), i.e. not too warm, just stay in the pool for a few minutes to cool off.  Your normal skin temperature is usually above 90 degrees so full immersion in 80 degree water will cool you off.  The longer you can stay immersed in lower temperature water, the cooler your body will be when you get out of the pool.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a cool or cold shower.  Most people like the feeling of a hot shower but if you're already overheated, this just makes the problem worse.  You'll be sweating worse after a hot shower.  Take as cold a shower as you can stand and spend extra time with the cool water directed at your head where your body's thermal regulating system is located.  A cool head is a cool body. Again, the longer you can do this, the lower your body temperature will be when you get dressed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally you should do both of these, but obviously time is the constraint here.  As a final measure, I sometimes leave my shirt unbuttoned and untucked until I cool off a bit and use my towel to blot up the sweat off my body for a few minutes. </p>

"Measuring laundry load weight to determine right amount of detergent to use","402","","<p>On my detergent's instructions it says to use x amount of powder per (x)KG of clothes.</p>

<p>While there are a bunch of clothes that will be going into the load, how can i determine the right amount of detergent to use for the load if the instructions indicate a detergent amount per load weight? or can i just use roughly amount of whatever i think is ok?</p>
","<p>Frankly, I'm surprised your brand expects you to know the <em>weight</em> of your laundry to use their product. Every brand I use specifies a fraction of a <strong><em>cap-full</em></strong> based on the <em>volume</em> of the load.</p>

<p><em>For example:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Large load:</strong> use a capful<br>
  <strong>Medium load:</strong> use 2/3 capful<br>
  <strong>Small load:</strong> use 1/3 capful  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My suggestion is to <strong>use volume instead of weight</strong> to estimate the amount of detergent you need. </p>

<h3>Estimating the amounts needed by volume</h3>

<p>First, fill your washing machine to capacity to determine an average weight<sup>1</sup> of a ""full load"". Using the cap or measuring cup for your detergent, add the amount of detergent suggested for that weight. Use a permanent marker to place a mark on the measuring cup at that level and label it ""full load"". Then mark off whatever increments are convenient for that fraction of a load (see the example above).</p>

<p>That will provide a convenient reference so you don't have to weigh your laundry each time. If your laundry is not coming out clean, you can add a bit more. Stained or dirtier laundry may also need a bit more detergent while less soiled loads may need a bit less. Measurements are not typically that precise. </p>

<hr>

<p><em><sub><sup>(1) </sup>To determine the weight of an item without a dedicated freight scale: Weigh yourself with common household body-weight scale while holding the item (e.g. the bag of laundry). Your weight holding the item minus your normal weight (without the item) equals the weight of the item itself.</sub></em></p>

"How to easily keep track of similar looking wires","396","","<p>So my irrigation system has 4 cables which each contain 6 bundled wires. To make things worse, the 6 bundled wires are the same color between the four cables (red, green, blue, yellow, white, black) and all have the same sheathing color. I'm going to be replacing and relocating the controller, but in the interim due to the way the wiring is routed, I will need to disconnect and re route all wires, so it will be very difficult to keep which one is which straight.</p>

<p>I could individually label each one, but this sounds like a massive pain -- and possibly not reliable because no matter how I attach the labels, it's highly probable at least one would slip off the wire as it is being pulled through interstitial space in the walls.</p>

<p>I could just ""test"" each wire when it's done. I know in each bundle the colored wires go to sprinkler heads while the white is the common wire, but this sounds like a pain in the butt.</p>

","<p>Label each bundle when you disconnect them.  Then pull them through the conduit one at a time; if you lose a label, you can replace it right then, while the other three wires are known quantities.</p>

<p>For the individual colored wires, you might try a ""telco"" crimp connector.  These are made for indoor telephone wire, likely similar to the low-voltage, low-current wiring in your control bundles.  Each crimp can be used to attach a short loop of wire that runs through a tag of some sort (even buttons, if you have a button jar you almost certainly have 24 distinct buttons to use as tags).  Even better, they don't require special tools to attach; just put the wires in the holes and squeeze the crimp with plain pliers.  You can clip and restrip the wires when you're done needing the labels, of course.</p>

<p>So..I'd like to mold them in!</p>

-40 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit </p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>Should I heat the whole bottle up and indent the desired grip with a cool implement, heat up the implement and press it into the bottle, or some other solution?</p>

<p>An ideal answer would not only provide justification for the proposed method, but also suggestions on the most feasible way to enact it.</p>
","<p>Currently, Nalgene bottles are made from a BPA Free, Copolyester called ""Tritan"".</p>

<p>From literature on a similar medical grade version <a href=""http://www.eastman.com/Literature_Center/M/MBS612.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a></p>

<p>It looks as though you have to take it to AT LEAST 110C to get it to ""glass transition"" state, basically meaning it's almost workable.</p>

<p>The difficulty here, is to achieve this temperature, you may need something other than boiling water, or similar.</p>

<p>My suggestion (assuming you don't mind some trial and error, and losing some bottles in the meantime) is to heat the entire unit in an over set to just as close to 110C as you can.</p>

<p>Then using some implements (wooden spoons, kitchen utensils, gloved hands, etc) manipulate it as you see fit. Also, I would cool it slowly to avoid introducing too much stress, too quickly to vessel which could cause cracks.</p>

<p>Note(s): You want to keep the lid on the bottle I'm assuming, so take care not to deform the threaded area around the mouth of the bottle.</p>

<p>Some plastics also have a ""memory"" to their molded shape, so even if you heat it and form it, the bottle may eventually resume its original shape (part of its benefit for some applications).</p>

<p>IMO - the amount of effort and potential loss of a few water bottles may be more time, energy and cost than an extended research of products online. </p>

"What can I use to rejoin porcelain broken pieces?","388","","<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I have in my room a porcelain statue given to me by my mother. </p>

<p>So, as the title says:</p>

<p><strong>What can I use to rejoin porcelain broken pieces?</strong></p>
","<p>An experienced hand with slow-setting two-part epoxy (sometimes called araldite) is probably perferred over cyanoacrylate, but the water-thin super glue would be the best second choice.</p>

<p>For epoxy, you'd ensure the glue is mixed thoroughly, apply a thin coat to one surface, join the parts and clamp them in place, ignoring glue that squeezes out of the joint (it'll be easy to remove from the glossy glazed surface after it cures).  Don't disturb the joint until the full curing time has passed, and keep it in a warm room (above 20 C).  Once fully cured, the excess glue can be easily chipped off the glossy surface and carefully trimmed even with the glaze with a razor blade or similar thin, sharp blade.</p>

<p>For thin super glue, you'd join the parts dry, apply a minimum drop of glue at the join, and let it draw into the joint.  If the joint area is large, you may need a second drop.  Curing may take minutes, rather than seconds, on a non-porous material, but can be accelerated by breathing your moist, warm breath on the joint.  Be careful not to use too much; it's difficult to remove cleanly, even from glossy surfaces, and there's a hazard of gluing your fingers to the statue.</p>

<p>The down side of this is that either glue will preclude a second try with the other, so it may be sensible to intentionally break a cheap item of the same material, to gain practice gluing.</p>

","<p><strong>It takes a long time to heat your room because the heat from the static heater moves to the ceiling so that you don't feel it at the beginning.</strong> As you wait, there is more air being heated, and the height above which there is hot air becomes smaller.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Place the heater in the middle of the room.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the fan such that it blows air on the heater. <strong>Set it to maximum.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The maximum setting won't add more heat in the room (except from the fan's motor, but that is negligible). However, it will create turbulent mixing of the air. Therefore, instead of having hot air at the ceiling of your room and still cold air at your height, you would obtain air at a medium temperature, fairly uniform in the whole room.</p>

Basically, the lid came off the thermos and everything in the backpack became soaked in the coffee.  The only item I am not sure how to clean is my leather wallet.  Brief googling suggests putting it through a washing cycle is a bad idea but good suggestions on how to clean the entire wallet inside and out were not forthcoming.  Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>Speaking as one who did inadvertently put his leather wallet through the washing cycle...   </p>

<p>It is a very soft black aniline leather, so I feared the worst. A lot of colour came out of it, into everything inside it. My driver's license will forever bear the marks, though oxygen bleach recovered it &amp; the currency notes sufficiently to read/spend. All my bank cards survived, NFC &amp; chip &amp; PIN.<br>
You won't have the same problems, of course, as you can choose to remove everything else first.</p>

<p>The wallet itself, aside from some slight shrinkage in the stitching - cotton rather than artificial fibre I would presume - actually survived the incident reasonably well, &amp; is still in use to this day.</p>

<p>I'd recommend putting it in a zipped patch-type trouser pocket to keep the wallet in shape, &amp; a gentle, cool, short wash. Dry naturally afterwards, of course. [Mine was discovered before it went through the tumble dryer too - I don't think that would have done it much good at all.]<br>
When it comes out, flex &amp; stretch it to preserve the shape &amp; the stitching.</p>

<p>One caveat.<br>
Because of the difference in manufacturing &amp; finishing of different leather types, you may have less success if it is not made of aniline leather. Split leathers have a plastic-like coating, which is likely to strip if it gets too wet &amp; is then subject to mechanical wear.<br>
If it's that type, then I wouldn't do more than give it a quick rinse in warm soapy water.</p>

"Preventing Bed Resonance","360","","<p>This is somewhat similar to <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/15533/how-to-prevent-bed-movements-noises-when-having-sex"">this question</a>, but not exactly the same, because it's not about noise per se and I'm not the one causing it (yet). The floor of my apartment is very light (probably cheap) fake wood vinyl, and it's above a mostly-empty and not well insulated crawlspace, and is attached to one other apartment. And unfortunately, the way the building is set up places the two apartments' bedrooms right next to one another. So, whenever my neighbors perform some certain...oscillatory activities, I can feel the vibrations very distinctively from my bed. </p>

<p>What should I do to cut down on this? Would lowering my bed to the floor help? It is currently supported by six approximately 6 inch metal legs and on a box spring, on a hardwood floor (which I know is the real problem, but unfortunately I can't change that). Would it help to place the bed legs on a rug or something? What about a heavier bed-frame? It's currently resting on the thin metal rails that came with the mattress.</p>

<p>Also, should I assume that anything I do on my bed would be felt in the same way by the other tenants? If it's my bed that's causing the resonance effect, maybe I wouldn't need to worry about bothering them (unless they have the same kind I suppose). Or would whatever changes you recommend also cut down on this?</p>
","<p>If you are directly above a crawlspace, you can add some support for the beam (bearer) supporting the floor joists under you. In the illustration, the centre beam would be the problem spot to check.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1f3qn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1f3qnm.png"" alt=""Floor cross-section showing supports, and floor joist""></a></p>

<p>The best material to use is concrete cement blocks piled on top of each other to support the common wall separating your apartment from Casanova's. There might even be a support already there where the shims (grey part on top of supports) have become displaced. The support might have dropped, become dislodged, or be missing.</p>

<p>A car jack can boost and hold the beam temporarily while you fit the last parts of the support column into place before you lower the floor.</p>

<p>Try increasing the height about an inch the first time you jack up the floor. You can use dry wood shims for thicknesses less than concrete blocks.</p>

<p>Did it work? If it isn't perfect, Casanova will help test your work and you can modify the amount of support until it's solid and doesn't move during the most amourous activity.</p>

<p>It's not complex or hard. The heaviest thing will be a concrete block, one at a time. Take your time. Good Luck.</p>

"How to fasten a length of plastic rope which is just too short","358","","<p>If I have less rope than necessary to tie multiple knots fore safety, and I am trying too tie both the ends to an iron rod (similar to how I have depicted here with another rod in between or straight between two iron rods), the rope is about 20 centimeters longer than the distance between the two rods and hence leaves very little room for a comprehensive knot</p>

"How to stop a trashbin from stinking","358","","<p>Okay, so we have bin collection once a week. For clarity sake, this is what our bin looks like:</p>

The bin continues to smell even when there isn't the bag (<em>or rubbish</em>) inside of it. It's even clean inside the bin, which ends up in me having to wash the bin out.</p>

<p>Are there any options to keep said bin ""smelling nice"" / ""not stinking""? I'm thinking of a more permanent solution (removing the smell), not masking the smell. Would Baking Soda be the option of choice?</p>
","<p>Don't put food in the trash. Instead, flush down the toilet or use the disposal. Rinse out cans and containers before throwing in the trash.</p>

<p>Wash the bin out periodically. If you leave it sit, it will eventually air out, but it may help to wash out with a hose.</p>

<p>I would remove the big trash bag from the external bin. It serves only to prevent the bin from airing out. Do not throw anything into the bin that is not already in a trash bag or grocery bag. A bag in the bin itself is unnecessary.</p>

<p>When throwing small bags into the bin, insure they are tied.</p>

<p>Make sure to have the bin at the curb on time for weekly pick up.</p>

<p>I do not recommend baking soda or similar remedies. Once you stop whatever bad habits regarding the trash bin, putting an agent in the bin will not be necessary. Do things differently starting now and the smell will be gone in a few days.</p>

"Rising to the Challenge - Mattress on top of Roof","350","","<p>I'm going to be moving across the US in a few days and am looking to transport my queen mattress (no boxspring) about 600 miles.  Nearly every single person I've spoken with has strongly advised against putting it on my roof and recommended simply renting a trailer instead (stories of mattresses transforming into sails, hurling through the air, plummeting gas mileage, incessant overhead noise, being ticketed by the police, and physical damage to the roof abound).</p>

<p>However, assuming I would still like to attempt transporting the mattress on my roof, what would be the best (safest) way to proceed? Should I strap it directly to my roof?

<p>I'll be driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a roof rails / crossbars.</p>
","<p>The flexibility of the piece is the difficulty to overcome. The air blast will make keeping the shape of the mattress difficult so it will let airflow distort it. It will be tough to fasten it securely enough no matter how many straps you use. Wrap your mattress in plastic to protect it from dirt, debris, and insects.<br><br>
Best way would be to box the mattress so that it will not distort before you place it on a roof rack for secure tie-down as with any stiff package. </p>

<p>Second, minimalist method will be to sandwich the mattress between two boards (2x4s) one-third of the way in from each side for the full length of the mattress to prevent it from flexing.

<p>If you want to keep the blades from touching the non-skid pad you've spread out in the drawer, you could use 2 combs: one closer to the handles, and one a few inches farther down the blades.</p>

<p>You may want to keep the comb(s) upright more securely, so you aren't just relying on the friction of the tines against the blades. Supports shouldn't be too hard to dream up:</p>

<ul>
<li>a couple of L-braces</li>
<li>another comb perpendicular to the first comb, and you slide the first comb in between the teeth of the second comb</li>
<li>just hot-glue it to the side of the drawer</li>

You may opt to simply scrub the seal manually with some bleach but running a cycle with some nice hot water will most definitely have a stronger chance of fighting the mold.<br> Next dab a diluted mixture of bleach into the remaining areas that the mold may be roaming and leave for 10 minutes before wiping down.<br> <br> <strong>Prevention</strong><br>Don't always wash on low temperatures<br>Try to use detergents that contain bleach<br>Once you're clear of the mold, once a month put an empty boil wash on with some bleach/bleached detergent<br><br> The smell is a common result of the mold developed inside washing machines, once the spores have been eradicated then this will no longer be a problem.

"How to store books in less than ideal conditions?","331","","<p>It's not hard to find out how you should store books. Just Google ""how to store books"". Metal or sealed wood shelves, 50% humility, 60-75 °F, keep that constant, keep away from light, don't store in bags... But lets assume that some of these aren't obtainable. How, then, would one go about storing books.</p>

<p>Curerently, my climate controls aren't especially good. In the winter the temperature ranges from mid 50's to 70 °F, and in the summer, mid 60's to mid 80's. That's in an 8 hour period The land lord doesn't seem to think there is anything wrong with the HVAC and I can't install a window unit. I don't know what the humidity is, but as I type this, I am not comfortable.</p>

<p>My books include mass market paper backs, text books, hard covered books, collectors edition books (mostly Eston Press), trade paper back American and Japanese comics, and a handful of single issue comics. All of the American comics are of the modern sort, printed on pretty decent paper. I don't own any of the older, cheaper kind.</p>

<p>These are stored on cheap plastic veneered composite board constructed book shelves. These shelves are sufficiently old that I assume any solvents should have mostly dissipated. I have my more expensive books in open zip lock bags. I know that CLOSED zip locked bags are bad due to trapping humidity, and encouraging mold growth, but I also assume that an open bag should slow the rate at which humidity, and to a lesser degree temperature, changes. Even more valuable ones (anything worth more than $100) are also loosely wrapped in bubble wrap. I have a few Easton Press books still in their original manufacture's shrink wrap, which has small holes. my individual issues are bagged and boarded.</p>

<p>So, as for the question in this post: </p>

<ul>
<li>What should I do to help protect these books? </li>
<li>Have I made any invalid assumptions? For example, are my book shelves an issue, or the zip locks? </li>
<li>Also, what would you guys suggest to help mitigate the potential damage caused from a the inconsistent, and occasionally warm/humid environment where I'm living (second floor)?</li>
</ul>

<p>So much of what I've found is geared towards what is best, but ""best"" isn't always an option.<br>
Alternatively, am I already doing everything I should do under my restraints?</p>

<p>PS: I completely forgot that I own a dehumidifier, something which neither the land lord nor neighborhood council will complain about. That's one fewer issue. I just moved here and completely forgot about it. I'll dig it out, but humidity is probably the thing I'll have to worry about most.</p>
","<h2>Know thy enemy</h2>

<p>Your books worst enemy is of course, humidity. Humidity is also <em>conditio sine qua non</em> for the dreaded mold that will happily munch on the cellulose leaving behind not much in the way of a cultural legacy for future humans enslaved by Skynet. The details provided on your question indicate that temperature may not be a concern, since it falls within the range recommended by the <a href=""https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Northwest Documentation Center,</a> and <a href=""http://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/books.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">endorsed by the Library of Congress</a>. These resources also point to an ideal relative air humidity between 30% and 50%. </p>

<p>However, the most important factor is the <strong>stability</strong> of the environment rather than the <strong>actual specs</strong> chosen for such environment, as rapid changes in environmental conditions are the main culprit of document deterioration, as the rate of most chemical reactions affecting cellulose substrates is doubled with every 10&deg;C of temperature <em>increase</em>. High temperature combined with a high humidity concentration will encourage insect activity and mold growth, in addition to chemical deterioration. </p>

<h2>Chose your battle wisely.</h2>

<p>Since the temperature problem appears to be out of your control, and the temperature variations due to seasonal changes fall within the range of the above recommendations, my advice is to focus your efforts on the variable you <em>can</em> control <em>vis-a-vis:</em> <strong>humidity</strong>.</p>

<h2>Size up the monster.</h2>

<p>Peace of mind regarding the environmental conditions of your collection can only be achieved by properly measuring this conditions. You may wish to <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/hygrometers/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=13825071"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">acquire a hygrometer</a> which may not be as expensive an instrument as one may think, (around USD$ 10.00 at the time of writing) and can be considered chump change compared to the value of your collection.</p>

<p>In order for the hygrometer to be effective you may wish to arrange your collection within an enclosed bookshelf, with the books and documents tightly packed as space allows, per the recommendations cited above.</p>

<p>The idea is to avoid controlling the humidity of your entire apartment, and be able to measure humidity conditions within the critical document storage environment.  It doesent need to be airtight, just restrict the airflow enough to keep humidity out and optimize the performance of any dissecant or hygroscopic material you choose to control the environment within.</p>

<h3>Select your ideal arsenal for battle</h3>

<p>To get rid of humidity, and thus making the acquisition of an expensive fungicide a matter of redundancy, enclose a canister of a highly <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygroscopy?wprov=sfla1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hygroscopic</a> substance along with your dead-tree books collection, once this is done, any humidity within your bookshelf ends up getting sucked and sequestered by such substance, leaving a nice, dry, mold-unfriendly measured environment once you close the lids.</p>

<p>For this purpose, I recommend the use of <em>silica gel</em> packets that come with most electronic device or apparel packaging. However, since your collection seems rather extended, this alternative may prove impractical, unless you've been collecting the silica gel on your purchases for the last few years. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e9wbd.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e9wbd.jpg"" alt=""silica gel""></a></p>

<p>These <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_10?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=silica%20gel%20packets&amp;sprefix=silica%20gel%2Caps%2C179"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can be purchased in bulk</a>, (around USD$ 5.00 for 100 1g packets on Amazon, at the time of writing) and have the advantage of coming in an unobtrusive, small paper package that will allow moisture in, but won't let the silica gel spread all over.</p>

<p>A cheap alternative is to roll your own. One of the most hygroscopic substances available in the cheap is a mineral called <strong><em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeolite?wprov=sfla1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">zeolite</a></em></strong> which is the main ingredient of most brands of commercial <strong>non-clumping</strong> cat litter sand.</p>

<p>Just build your canister for zeolite using an average coffee filter for the purpose. It's porous enough to keep the zeolite in the envelope while not diminishing it's affinity for water in any discernable way.</p>

<h3>Wait!, how can i make sure i don't over-do it?</h3>

<p>Glad you asked, since future Skynet enslaved humans will be very disappointed if their hope for cultural legacy turns to dry dust in their hands upon touching it. </p>

<p>The question here is <strong>how much desiccant is about right to keep relative humidity between 30% and 50%</strong> The quick answer is: trial and error. That's why we're sizing up the monster and measuring the environment with the hygrometer we wisely invested in. Most silica gel manufacturers recommend this approach, but if we're sparing no expense, then purchasing desiccant canisters certified conformant to military spec <a href=""http://everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS/MIL-SPECS-MIL-D/MIL-D-3464E_6324/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MIL-D-3464E</a> is the way to go. </p>

<p>Be advised, though, that MIL-SPEC certified materials will cost anywhere between 200% to 500% more than your garden variety non-certified consumer grade materials. What you're buying with that cost difference is the certainty that the material <strong>will perform</strong> as stated on the specification with minimal deviation (again, as allowed by the same spec) </p>

<p>The specification defines a unit of dissecant, as the amount of material that will absorb 3g of water at 20% Relative humidity and 6g of water at 40% relative humidity, for bulk material; and 2.85g and 5.70g of water respectively for bagged materials. </p>

<p>Thus you can calculate the amount of dissecant units required given your environmental conditions. Note however that how much material is in a unit of dissecant depends on the specific materal, for military grade silica gel, a unit is about 50g in a 4.5"" x 3"" sealed porous paper bag</p>

<p>Or just use this <a href=""http://brownell.co.uk/silica_gel_desiccant_calculator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">handy calculator</a></p>

<h3>OMG! TMI! TL;DR!</h3>

<p>In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a hygrometer</li>
<li>Restrict airflow to your collection (pull a plastic cover over your bookshelf)</li>
<li>Place a canister of silica gel or zeolite within the bookshelf</li>
<li>Keep books tightly packed</li>
<li>Monitor the humidity on the bookshelf, adding silica gel as required</li>
<li>Periodically ""regenerate"" the silica gel per manufacturer instructions </li>
<li>Just toss a silica gel baggie on your zip-loc enclosed documents, and change from time to time</li>
<li>Don't feed skynet! Stop training it's algorithms by avoiding the use of Facebook like the plague (kidding)</li>

"Marijuana Smell Blocking During Local Travel","321","","<p>I live in a place where recreational marijuana use is 100% legal and I'm looking for the best hacks to conceal the smell of marijuana while driving for an amount of half an ounce or less.</p>

<p>I'm fine with answers that someone has that's just amazingly effective for any amount of half an ounce or less. So this means hacks for 1 gram up to 16 grams and everything in between. I need the answers to be extremely effective and I will put them to the test.</p>

<p>I would prefer to not have to rely on any chemical compounds and focus on more containment of the smell via a wrapping method, some sort of container and the alike. If it doesn't involve spraying chemicals, I'm listening.</p>

<p><strong>Reason</strong></p>

<p>I need to pick up some relatives in my state but the trip is a couple hours each way and they will be traveling back with me and I need to block the smell for my elderly grandmother due to allergies but I must take what is needed and a little extra so not taking any is not an answer.</p>

<p><strong>Potency</strong></p>

<p>Assume the potency and smell of this type of marijuana is the strongest and smelliest stuff out there at the moment when you answer.</p>
","<p>Easy! Put it in a thoroughly cleaned jar. If you have a full 1/2 (14grams), you should be able to put this in the smallest sized mason jar. This is also great for general storage of legal /medical marijuana, as it is airtight; completely ""smell proof""; and will not allow your flowers to dry out - in fact it will continue the curing process. If you don't want to buy mason jars, any glass food jar or any airtight container that is glass will work. Just make sure that if you're using something that once contained food, that after cleaning the jar you remove any rubber on the interior of the cap ( some have this some don't); the rubber will retain the food smell despite washing. For smaller amounts, empty  prescription medicine bottles with the label removed work excellent for this purpose.</p>

<p>If any of you also have an idea how I can change the smell in a room the easiest way, that would also be good! (I thought of wool (with the smell) which gets blown from behind with a fan to ""blow the smell"" into the room.)</p>
","<p>Smells are (sometimes complex) mixtures of chemicals, but I don't know anything about chemistry and don't have much advice there. </p>

<p>But, in general, your approach could be to try and find various combinations of things that smell <em>like</em> what you're looking for, possibly through experimenting. In some cases you might even be able to use the item itself. This is assuming you can't find a way to <em>store</em> smells (maybe somebody else will have an answer for that). For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sometimes you may be able to get the actual item that smells. If you can find a container that allows air to pass through but not the material itself you can put a fan behind it. For example, put a bunch of grass clippings in a <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=fine%20mesh%20bag"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fine mesh bag</a> (examples: strainer bags, filter bags, wrapped in cheesecloth, etc., or take a trip to the local fabric shop and see if there's a fine mesh fabric  you can use). To enhance the smell:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consider crushing, grinding, smashing, etc. the material, if applicable. For example, finely chop the grass, or use a mortar and pestle, or crush a bag of it under a rolling pin or something (or heck, run it over with a car), etc.</li>
<li>Store it in an airtight bag until you're actually ready to use it, to preserve the odors as long as possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In certain cases, such as if the item is a liquid, you may be able to boil it on the spot with a portable stove. For these types of materials you either wouldn't want a fan (let it fill up the room), or put the fan in a location that isn't going to interfere with the boiling. (Btw, if you're fortunate enough to have access to a good portable induction cooktop, nothing will beat that in terms of safety, convenience, and efficiency). </p></li>
<li><p>The thing I think you might have the most luck with is: Incenses, oils, and scented candles. If you have an incense or candle shop around, go check it out. All of these are very convenient to use, good at dissipating smells into the air, and most usefully, a lot of candles especially are already formulated to emulate certain smells. Incense is generally very cheap, candles unfortunately can get a little pricey sometimes. You'll want to experiment, possibly with <em>combinations</em>, to make sure the smell is accurate and also not <em>too</em> ""fake"" smelling or cloying (unless that's your goal). In this case a tiny fan (especially with incense) can help distribute the smell more quickly.  Anecdotally, I've found that one of the biggest triggers for thinking a smell is fake is if the smell is too <em>strong</em>, so you may have to come up with a way to control its distribution, for example by venting in fresh air to dilute the smell, or by lighting a candle only for a short while, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As for experiments, watch out for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_fatigue"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">olfactory fatigue</a> during testing, as well as drying out your sinuses. Also, you might want to have another person or two give you their opinions. Others' opinions can be valuable here. I'd structure any tests with other people by stating what <em>environment</em> they should imagine themselves in (or just setting it up around them) then asking them what they smell. For example: ""You are in a cave in the middle of a forest, it is slightly humid, cool, and dark, you hear the sound of a stream bubbling nearby and the wind whistling past the entrance. Describe what you smell."" </p>

<p>If you just say ""Hey does this smell like grass?"" you run the risk of severely biasing their response. If you just say ""What does this smell like?"" you may get some strange results as smells can get weird with no context. </p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you some good starting ideas, or is at least somewhat helpful. Sounds like an interesting project. Good luck!</p>

"Boiled water to clean leather","312","","<p>I've just been advised by a furniture repairman to clean my leather reclining armchair as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>boil some water</li>
<li>let it cool down</li>
<li>wipe down the armrests and headrest with that water</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, thinking back to my Chemistry 101, it seems to me like those first two steps are entirely superfluous. If you first boil water and then let it cool down again, all you've really accomplished is that you're left with slightly less water.</p>

<p>Is there any value to this advice? If so, why?</p>
","<p>If you live in a hard water area, there is some merit to boiling the water first. Boiling removes lime, which deposits inside the kettle as limescale; presumably water straight from the tap, still full of lime, may cause 'salt' marks to appear on the leather.</p>

<p>Some precautions are widely known, such as washing hands as often as possible, not touching the face with the hands, eating healthy foods, opening windows, sports etc. But what do you do? A real lifehack?</p>
","<p><strong><em>First and foremost methods are using droplet protection and cleaning whenever you touch something that is infected.</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Make a Face Mask.</em> These can be made out of handkerchiefs, high collars(if you aren't suppose to wear one, but you need to), disposable paper products that can be thrown away after you use them once. You could buy ones but these are home-made ones.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Make a barrier.</em> This can be done by putting high boundaries up, like books, laying coats across the area and etc. Anything that will protect against droplet infection.</p></li>

  <p>Avoid close contact.</p>
  
  <p>Germs are transmitted easily when you live in

  If you have a droplet-spread illness, avoid getting close to
  colleagues, friends, or family members. Tell them you're sick and that
  you don't want them to catch the virus. This helps protect them from
  getting sick, too.</p>

<p>And remember to hand wash and disinfect things that a lot of people touch before eating or use.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should wash or disinfect your hands whenever you've touched
  something that an infected person might recently have touched:
  computer keyboards, telephone receivers, doorknobs, elevator buttons,
  faucet handles, countertops, railings, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Using your sleeve when touching objects also helps. Using Vitamin C and other vitamins that promote immune health are suppose to help, but never overdose and consult a doctor. Vaccines are a must and depending on a the place you work, the vaccine may be free.</li>

"How can I avoid a side stitch while running?","305","","<p>I've been running to stay in shape for about a year and a half now, and sometimes this comes and goes. My left side tends to get a pretty painful ache from that exercise, and it takes a bit to go away. I can run for much longer than this pain allows.</p>

<p>The things I've tried so far are to breathe in and out with each step of one foot, to stretch side to side, drink a lot of water, and to just push through it. Sometimes this helps, but other times it is still very painful.</p>

<p>What are some tips for getting rid of or powering through the stitch?</p>
","<p>Give it two weeks and the ""stitch"" should go away with the same amount of exercise. </p>

<p>Here's why.</p>

<p>The side stitch you are experiencing is actually adaptive. It is the key to fitness. That side stitch is the result of inadequate oxygen to your kidneys (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"" rel=""nofollow"">hypoxemia</a>.) That hypoxemia triggers a variety of adaptive responses. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,3-Bisphosphoglyceric_acid"" rel=""nofollow"">2,3-DPG</a> will be released. This will change your red blood cell's affinity for oxygen making it easier for oxygen to be released. It will also result in the concentration of your blood (hemoconcentration) by causing you to shed fluid so your blood is thicker and carries more oxygen per unit of volume. (Your hemoglobin/hematocrit will increase.) Lastly, your kidneys will release <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"" rel=""nofollow"">erythropoietin</a> (i.e. the hormone Lance Armstrong and others chemically doped with) that will cause your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. </p>

<p>The main effects from hypoxemia will kick in about 7-10 days <em>after</em> you experience that side stitch and peak about 2 weeks after. That will be your moment of maximal fitness. </p>

<p>If you do not continue to stress your body at that point - your 2,3-DPG levels will drop and your body will slide back to its normal state. </p>

<p>This adaptive cycle is likely why all those recent studies you may have been seeing on high-intensity training (HIT) have shown it to be just as effective as long cardio sessions (i.e. training just 1 minute three times a week is just as effective as training one hour three times a week on FiO2 uptake and other measures of fitness.) </p>

<p>In sum, the ""stitch"" in your side is actually the key to achieving higher states of fitness. About two weeks after feeling a ""stitch"" will be your peak moment of adaptation from that hypoxemia causing that ""stitch."" If you can drive yourself to feel a ""stitch"" every time - you are taxing your cardiovascular system enough to trigger adaptations to higher levels of fitness.</p>

<p>""Fitness"" is a high energy state. Though it increases adaptability to stresses and decreases short term mortality - there is a clear underlying metabolic cost that the body truly wants to avoid. Your body will continually try to slip back to that lower energy state and make it so the ""stitch"" returns. </p>

<p>Someday we may discover why the body seems to work so hard to be an ""unfit"" state.</p>

"How to craft a non-return valve for air?","304","","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I have been learning to play the bagpipes on a practise chanter for some time now. This is basiaclly just the chanter on which you play the melody without the bag and the drones. Since I have to wait some months to get my real bagpipes I tried to build one myself using freezer bags and ducktape. This is the result:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gN9a2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gN9a2m.jpg"" alt=""the bag"" title=""Click photo for full size""></a></p>

<p>So instead of blowing the chanter directly with the mouth, the air is saved in the bag. To play a tune I use my left arm to apply pressure on the bag to force the air through the chanter which then produces a sound.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>To stop the air from going out to where it came in, a bag gets blown through a non-return valve. So the air can only exit the bag through the chanter. My first attempt of crafting such a valve looked like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GijsJ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GijsJm.jpg"" alt=""my non-return valve"" title=""Click photo for full size""></a></p>

<p>This is just a straw with some ducktape. It <em>kinda</em> works but there is still a bit of air going back out. Also it doesn't last long since the moisture in my breath removes the stickyness of the ducktape. Which brings me to my question: How can I craft such a non-return valve? It has to meet the following requirement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resistant against moisture from my breath.</li>
<li>Doesn't let any air go out of the bag.</li>
<li>Has to have diameter around 0.5 mm. If it's too thin it gets too hard to blow.</li>
<li>Withstands a reasonable pressure from the air trying to get out.</li>
<li>Doesn't use too unusual material. I should be able to get it in a supermarket.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hoping for some interesting ideas!</p>
","<p>Using the same straw &amp; a rubber-band, cut the end off a long 'sausage-shape' regular kid's party balloon [cheap rubber one, not the expensive 'tin cushion' mylar variety] &amp; fasten the mouth-piece inflator section to the straw using the rubber band. The other end, where you cut the end off just flaps in the breeze.</p>

<p>You may need to experiment with the right length to stop it sounding like a whoopee cushion when you blow, but any air pressure inside your bag will immediately seal it up as soon as the pressure inside is greater than outside.<br>
As mentioned in comments, if the pipe is too large, the balloon is likely to turn inside-out &amp; fail, requiring a mesh to prevent that; but I think you ought to be OK using a straw.</p>

<p>A round balloon might work just as well.</p>

<p>Actually... mylar would probably work too, but they're expensive, by comparison.</p>

"A soft floor cover to use with a standing desk","299","","<p><strong>Context</strong>: For about 6 weeks now I have been using a large amount of textbooks, shoe-boxes, and a miniature table to turn my regular home desk into a standing desk. I have found that standing barefoot or in flip flops for a long time makes my heels tender. For now I am borrowing a 1/2 inch foam yoga mat from my mom and folding it in half for extra softness, and it makes standing for extended periods of time much more convenient. However, she does need it to use it from time to time, and as such I need to buy one for myself. Purchasing another yoga mat would be satisfactory, but I'm wondering if a more inspired solution exists. </p>

<p><strong>The actual question</strong>: What objects would you suggest to best eliminate heel tenderness while standing in one spot for an excess of two hours? Preferably, the object should provide as much cushioning as two 1/2 inch yoga mats stacked onto each other, and must provide at minimum 2.5 X 1.5 feet of standing space. Hopefully, I can make or buy it with a budget of 25 dollars.  </p>

<p><strong>Solutions I have considered</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>Buying another regular half inch yoga mat and folding it in half. </li>
<li>Nothing else yet. </li>
</ul>
","<p>Try closed-cell high-density urethane. Such stuff is used as kneeling pads and knee-cushioning material for rug-installers who spend their day as rug-rats. Avoid standing in one place for long periods which can't be good for you, either.

"Moving huge quantity of salt","295","","<p>Every year or 2, I buy a bulk quantity of water softener salt. I always get 25kg bags and I buy 20-40 bags in order to get them at the best price.</p>

<p>I'm then left with a problem. I have space to store them in my attic room (where they need to be, alongside the water softener), but that means I have to transport all of the bags up a flight of stairs (just one, thankfully), to the attic room.</p>

<p>Carrying just one of them by hand is just about doable; doing it 20-40 times is impossible.</p>

<p>I've considered some form of winch, but any permanent/expensive equipment is overkill given the fact that it will only be used every year or 2.</p>

<p>Any ideas for how to move them without back-breaking effort?</p>

<p>Yes, smaller bags would work, yes a smaller quantity would work but both would cost more money. Opening the bags and dividing them is impractical because I would have to reseal them all afterwards. Leaving them downstairs and spreading the work is also a non-starter due to space constraints.</p>

<p>EDIT: although a diagram is overkill, here is a description of the ""landscape"" within which this needs to take place: 1) the stairs are a straight, single flight of 13 steps, 2) there is a large area of clear floor-space at the bottom of the stairs within which to work, 3) there is a doorway about 1 metre opposite the top of the stairs i.e. useful for bracing a pulley mechanism against, 4) this gives about 5 metres of working space at the top of the stairs, 5) the ceiling above the stairs follows the slope of the stairs from bottom to top, 6) the stairs are carpeted but 7) I wouldn't want to damage it.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I'm not able to delete this question but it's a waste of time it being up. Can people please vote to close it if you are able.</p>
","<p>Consider using the laws of physics as your ally.</p>

<p>If you don't <em>lift</em> the sacks but <em>pull them up a slope</em>, you need a lot less strength and eliminate the risk of stumbling on the stairs.</p>

<p>So you need first a slope:
A few sheets of thin plywood will do. You need enough to cover the length of your stairs plus a few strips of duct tape or similar. If you are really crafty, you can even create something that can be folded accordion-style and stored for future use. (Or go all the way and do something with hinges?) But make it narrow enough so that you can still walk up and down the stairs.</p>

<p>Then something that is robust enough to slip or roll up that slope - as your original bags appear too flimsy. Either a very robust sack or a little cart - think ""oversized skateboard"", perhaps with an additional upright board at the bottom end. The former is cheaper, the latter probably easier to operate due to the reduced friction and could be used to maneuver the salt to its final storage place.</p>

<p>Add a long rope and - optional - a ring or hook at the doorway at the top, load the salt bags on your sliding element and you are good to go.</p>

<p>You will spend a bit more time for the initial setup, but you will always walk the stairs without a heavy load and the only lifting will be when you place the salt bags in and out of the sliding sack or cart - that might be even done by rolling them instead of true lifting. </p>

<h2>Pinhole Reading Glasses</h2>

<p>Put your index finger, middle finger, and thumb into a circle and leave a small hole in the middle (the three fingers of the same hand allow a tiny triangular opening which is held less than one inch from the eye). Bring the hole to your eye and look through.</p>

<h3>How this works</h3>

<p>By doing this you are limiting the amount of light going through the lens in your eye. This gives slight magnification and increases your range (depth of field) of clear vision.</p>

"Making the most of a mug that can't be put in the microwave or diswasher","287","","<p>My sister got me a pretty cool mug(R2D2 mug, had to tell!) and I absolutely love it, I read at the bottom of it that it can't be put in the microwave nor the dishwasher, not sure why but something tells me it has to do with the ""paint-job"" I have it a work and heating water in one mug only to pour it in my mug seems tedious. Is there anything I can do to maybe make the structure/paint of the mug more durable, or an easier workaround for using a mug that cant be heated in the microwave (the washing part doesn't really bother me, I don't mind washing it manually)</p>
","<p>Something about the mug interacts with the microwaves; almost certainly because it's conductive, so that it heats up in ways you wouldn't want it to. This means that you can't change the mug's non-microwave-friendliness without substantially changing the mug. For instance, if it's the coating/glaze/paint, then you'd have to remove it in order to make it non-conductive. If it's the mug material itself then you'd have to remove the mug itself to make it non-conductive (you'd have <a href=""http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheEmperorsNewClothes_e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The Emperor's New Mug</a>).</p>

<p>One test I've seen is to fill the possibly non-microwaveable container with water and then microwave it for twenty seconds at a time, seeing whether the water or the container heats up faster. If the container doesn't heat up you're fine. If it does, then you're stuck.</p>

"Removing ink/toner from smudges on thick paper","272","","<p>I have already looked at this <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/4101/how-to-remove-ink-from-paper"">question</a>, and whilst some of the answers might suit my case, I thought I should put this to the community, as my situation is slightly different. </p>

<p>I printed out some schematics onto 210gsm paper (our printer is a HP Laserjet P2035). The ink and toner has struggled to take to the paper. Now as I have been working on cutting out these shapes, the original ink is rubbing off to some extent and it is creating smudges on the reverse of the paper, either from my matt cutter or my hands (much like newspaper print).</p>

<p>So of course the question is which is the best method to attempt to remove these smudges. </p>

<p>Photos of front and reverse for referece: </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Sorry I should add I was slightly wary about adding a solution to the paper for fear of buckling it (acetone for example). </p>
","<p>A normal white plastic eraser should do the trick. As you pointed out, the ink is already smudging so any reasonable effort to remove it will work. Make sure to keep the eraser clean to avoid working the toner into the paper surface.</p>

<p>Another possibility would be to apply a thin layer of paper (rubber) cement over the smudges. After it dries, use a natural rubber pick-up square (sometimes called a mouse) to remove the cement and smudges.<br> It contains no water so it will not distort the paper. It dries quickly.
<strong>Note:</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> use ""one-coat"" cement which will be more difficult to remove if not impossible. I use ""Best-Test"" brand paper cement. A small bottle comes with its own brush applicator.</p>

<p>A third possibility would be to use a very sharp knife such as a single-edge razor blade or x-acto knife (with #10 General Purpose blade which is curved to avoid gouging or cutting the surface). Use the appropriate blade nearly perpendicular to the surface to gently scrape the toner off the paper. Pull the blade toward you lightly and repeatedly until the mark is gone. This is a make-shift knife eraser that is used on parchment and other such surfaces. When done properly, there is little or no trace of the mark on the piece.<br>Note that the knife eraser needs a bit of attention when used on folds, creases, or scores that make the surface uneven. </p>

<p>I heard the sender has to pay postage twice, and if enough people did this, they would probably be reluctant in sending me more useless credit card applications, etc.</p>

<p>However, I've heard that this method isn't effective when the letter says ""Electronic Response Requested"" (or something along those lines).</p>
","<p>This is completely ineffective.  Most junk mail (at least in the USA) is sent in a mail class that doesn't even provide return service; all you accomplish is to task the Postal Service with transporting the mail piece to a Dead Letter Office, where it will be destroyed, if it isn't destroyed at an earlier step in the dead letter process.</p>

<p>Functionally, there is no way to get off junk mailing lists; many bulk mailers simply buy listings of all valid addresses in a particular geographic region and send their pieces to <em>Every. Single. Address.</em>  These are often the ones marked ""Resident"" or addressed to someone who might have moved years before (with ""Or Current Resident"" appended).  Even on more targeted lists, like customers of particular businesses (those that ask your address at checkout, or issue loyalty cards, for instance), once you're on the list, you probably can't get off it.</p>

<p>Best I can suggest is that you might be able to heat your house for ""free"" (you'll spend some of your labor, but little to no money) if you can manage to get <em>on</em> enough junk mailing lists -- there are a number of videos on YouTube on the subject of converting junk mail to homemade stove or fireplace fuel.

","<p>If you're in the middle of a fire, you shouldn't be posting on Lifehacks SE, you should be evacuating the building.  (joke)</p>

<p>The general rule is, only fight a fire if it's either quite small, or you need to do so to clear an evacuation route.  That said, if you were trapped by a fire and the only extinguisher in reach had this problem, you'd need some kind of tool to pull the remains of the pin out of the handles so you could activate the extinguisher.

Another option might be nail clippers (which many people carry with them) or a multi-tool (forbidden in some office environments because of attached knife blade, but pretty common otherwise -- I carry one every day).</p>

<p>One slightly out-of-the-box idea would be to very gently squeeze the handles to take the spring tension off the pin hole, and see if the pin will just drop out (turn the extinguisher on its side and shake) or strike the short end of the pin with the base of a stapler, paperweight, or similar, in hopes of driving it through so it doesn't lock the handles any longer.</p>

"How to clip/clamp/clutch/pinch side of faulty old LCD monitor screen?","253","","<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uUH8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uUH8m.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Probably due to old age, the screen of my old Sony SDM M51 monitor flickers. The Sony representative advised that inside the lower left side (hereinafter abbreviated as LS) of the monitor (as depicted in red above), parts nearing the front of the screen have loosened from parts at the back. So  the only solution is to clench, grip, or squeeze the front and back of the red area (eg by hand), which has eliminated the flickers for the past years. Alas, the detachment worsened a few days ago, to the extent that my hands hurt and the LS now needs continual compression and grasp to stop flickering. </p>

<p>So what can I use to resolve this problem? I tried a large binder clip which only works when my hand clings to the clip; as soon as I stop holding onto the clip, it flings itself off because the LS is too thick.  </p>

<p>Footnote: Please advise on apter words to describe this problem (I struggle to find the perfect diction). <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=sony+sdm+m51&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jknrVJqmOY6wyATShYDoAQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=744#imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=AfDlkr0XEoVK8M%253A%3BIQbuHrwk8CCCHM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fpc.watch.impress.co.jp%252Fdocs%252Farticle%252F20000803%252Fsony.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fpc.watch.impress.co.jp%252Fdocs%252Farticle%252F20000803%252Fsony.htm%3B640%3B483"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google</a> effected <a href=""http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/article/20000803/sony.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the original image</a>. </p>
","<p>An adaption to the binder clips would be to put some adhesive putty on either side of the clip to hold it in place.<br>
If you put something like <strong><em><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bostik-801103-Blu-Tack-Handy/dp/B0001OZI70"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blue Tac</a></em></strong> on either side then this will give it more to grip onto and it should keep it in place for your purpose!</p>

<p>There are always larger clamps and clips that you could buy in order to replace what you already have but in terms of working with what you have this solution is a goer. </p>

<p>A second possible solution which may or may not work is to <strong><em>stretch a few elastic bands over the side of the monitor</em></strong> (keep it on the plastic edges in order to keep screen un-obscured) this would probably work better if you had something underneath the bands in order to make them rise away from the screen and give it more of a pushing force to push the screen together, but again this may or may not work, worth a try though!</p>

<p>Thirdly and perhaps the most <em>'hacky'</em> method would be to improvise your own binder / clip. Get two sturdy bits of wood / metal / plastic, either as a rod or thin block type shape.  </p>

<p>Three quarters of the way up the two rods / blocks <em>(hereinafter referred to as 'the rods')</em> place a wedge of paper (at least as thick, if not thicker, as the monitor) and then wrap an alastic band or two around the two rods above the wedge of paper (one loop below in order to keep the wedge in place) and wrap a few times until fairly tight and you can use them sort of like chopsticks.  </p>

<p>You can then use them as you would a normal clip and add Blue Tac or something to the ends to make them more sticky if need be! Below is an image of chopsticks which is basically what I am trying to explain:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qmtaj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qmtajm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

"Removing set grout from tile","251","","<p>I recently tiled a bathroom myself for the first time, only to discover afterward that I was not as successful at cleaning the excess grout off as I had initially thought. As a result, there are now a few patches of set grout on the tiles. What is the best way to clean this off now? 
Thanks!</p>
","<p>Next time clean off the grout before it dries with a damp sponge that you keep ringing out in a bucket of warm water.<br>
Let the sponge lie flat against the tile and lightly glide it over both the tile and the spaces with the grout.<br>
The tile is raised up from the spaces so just let the sponge pass ""lightly"" over the spaces taking the excess grout from the face of the tile onto the sponge without taking the grout out from between the tiles. Keep rinsing the grout out of the sponge in the bucket of water until the grout is out of the sponge. Squeeze out most of the water and keep going flat over the tile with a rinsed out damp sponge until the tile is clean and there is only grout between the tiles. </p>

<p>If you want this messed up job to be really nice you probably need to do it over.<br>
This is what you do depending on how big the tiled area is.   </p>

<p>If it's a small area on only one wall get a piece of sheetrock or cement board and cover over the messy tiles with it so you have a fresh wall. You might need to drill through the messy tile first and then nail or screw the board to the studs by putting the screw through the hole you drilled.<br>
Don't drill too deep, only enough to get through the tile; the screw will go through the other wall and into the stud. Then tile over the fresh wall with new tile and grout it the way I explained above.  </p>

<p>One other thing:  don't grout the whole wall at once; grout and clean smaller areas before moving to the next area. It's more important to get the grout off the face of the tile before it dries than it is to grout it all in one shot.<br>
You can always go back and add a little grout here and there if you miss a spot; it's a lot easier to add wet grout to fill spaces than it is to take dried grout off of tile without damaging the tile.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately there is not a sure way to remove dried up grout from the face of tile and get a professional looking job; you have to do it over... Sorry maybe someone else has a better way but this is the way I would do it.   </p>

","<p>Basically it's due your digestion process, a lot of blood is pumped to the stomach area for digestive process, which causes the tiredness. Obviously, the heavier the meal the longer it'll take for your body to fully digest it, the longer you're gonna feel sleepy. Instead of having that particular ONE heavy meal, you can still eat the same amount throughout the day. Prepare snacks so when you get to lunch hour you don't eat as much as before yet you're still getting the same amount of food, just not all at once. </p>

<li><p>This is the method: <a href=""http://m.wikihow.com/Bleach-Jeans"">http://m.wikihow.com/Bleach-Jeans</a></p></li>

<hr>

<p>Get a 1 to 3 bleach solution and carefully apply in the pattern you want. Apply by spray bottle, sponges, or painting. Whichever you want and is better for the design. Tie off the areas you are not doing and wrap those in plastic wrap or bags. Not Neccesary, but I am very careful. Bleach cannot be undone. Wash the jeans after, but be sure to rinse the area with bleach to get most of it out before washing them so the whole jeans don't get bleached. Try doing at least 2 or 3 treatments, so you can go slow and do not try do in it all at once just in case you do much and ruin them. For the design your going for I would say at least 2 sessions and a sponge. </p>

<p>My problem is similar to this one: <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/346/how-do-i-get-lint-out-of-a-headphone-jack"">How do I get lint out of a headphone jack?</a></p>

<p><strong>My problem:</strong><br>
I have a Lumia 640 XL device, a little bit more than 1 years old.<br>
I use it with a Sennheiser Urbanite headphone on a daily basis.  </p>

<p>One day I noticed, that my music stopped suddenly. Even if I resumed it in the player (Spotify), the music wouldn't start again. After a few trials and moving the headphone cable a little bit, it worked again. But during walking, it stopped very often.<br>
It still happens almost every day, even if I barely move the cable or anything. It's like the phone loses the connection with the headphones.</p>

<p>When the music does come back somehow, it's like it's on for a few seconds ""muted"" (I see in the music player that it's playing), then all of a sudden I can hear it again.</p>

<p><strong>Investigation</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's not because of Spotify, since the problem happens in Youtube as well</li>
<li>The headphone works flawlessly with another phone, notebook, tablet, etc., even if I try to move and ""break"" the cable a little bit</li>
<li>The phone works with another earphone flawlessly, even if I try to move its cable like with the headphone</li>
<li>I tried to clean the headphone jack both with a toothpick like tool and with compressed air. Some stuff came out, I'd say it's clean now.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I make sure, that my headphone / phone is broken, and not the other one?</li>
<li>How can it happen, that both of them function properly with an other tool, but not if I use them together, and they were fine for a year?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>There are indeed some marks</strong><br>

","<p>So you have established that both the headset and the phones are working as expected when connected to other devices. </p>

<p>I suspect the fault to be a kind of <strong>wear-in effect between socket and plug</strong>. The two parts would have their contact points always at the same locations. When you swap either part, they mate up with fresh contact points. Even if one side has wear, the new contact configuration is good enough to have a working connection.</p>

<p>Do the easiest thing first and have a <em>very</em> close look at the male bit of the headset. Use a magnifying glass and good light. Look out for any kind of marks. </p>

<p>If you find any, assume first they are dirt or verdigris instead of wear and try to remove them. Rubbing alcohol on soft cotton would be perfect to remove any greasy dirt. Verdigris is harder to get rid of. Don't worry about that now. Have another look. </p>

<p>Do the marks go away or get better? In that case it was just contamination.<br>
Try if it works now or if it gets any better. Only consider cleaning the mating female contacts as well, if you were able to reduce/remove any marks on the plug. This is a lot harder as - obviously they are less accessible. You may want to think about having this done for you in a reliable shop where they (should) have experience ... and take responsibility if anything goes wrong. </p>

<p>I would not recommend cleaning the female contacts otherwise, because any dirt or verdigris on <em>them</em> should leave a mark on the mating male side as well. So if you have established that any marks on the male side are actual wear, assume the female side is clean and don't risk anything. </p>

<p>So they are not working yet? Next easiest thing to do is - use an extension lead. Actually I am assuming you don't have one and need to go and get one or otherwise you would have tried that earlier.</p>

<p>This should basically do the same as you did when testing the headset with another device and the phone with another head set. I admit this is not very elegant but at least it will prove the concept and you can listen to music again. </p>

<p>If there was wear on the contacts, don't expect this to last as long as a new setup. The wear is not going to get any better over time and now you have two potential points of failure. When that happens, you will be looking at replacing things. Consider if either plug or socket can be swapped before getting a whole new headset or phone. </p>

<p>Well, nothing lasts forever.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p><em>Based on the pictures you edited into your question:</em></p>

<p>Here is a suggestion that should keep you going until you get the new cable; it's a hacky one too :) </p>

<p>Your picture shows nicely where the socket contacts engage the plug and wore away the (gold?, cadmium?) galvanised coating. If you could <strong>find a washer of some insulating material that would fit over the plug you would shift the contact points downwards</strong> by a distance equal the thickness of the washer. <em>The socket contacts would touch areas of the plug that are not worn</em>. </p>

<p>I would think the washer wouldn't have to be so thick as to shift the contact area entirely into the unworn area. Something like 0.2-0.3mmm is probably enough. Don't make it so thick that the bottom contact ends up too near the ridge, or the engagement mechanism won't work any more. </p>

<p>Instead of a washer you might have a <strong>thin o-ring</strong>?  </p>

<p>You could easily <strong>make something out of some clamshell packaging</strong> or similar plastic. You could even use cardboard which is available in different thicknesses. Try to make the center hole not too big, so it sits tightly on the plug, i.e. doesn't fall off when you unplug the cable. </p>

<p>Once you found something that works, but tends to come off, just <strong>use some glue</strong> to hold it in place. Obviously try not to get any glue on the contacts and make sure the glue is dry before using it, so you don't get any inside the socket. </p>

"How can I keep take-away fries crispy longer?","226","","<p>It takes approximately 12 minutes to get back to my apartment from the nearest McDonalds. When I order fries and take them back home, they become soft, compared to if I consume the fries at the restaurant immediately.</p>

<p>The fries are packed in a paper bag with other hot food, and I do attempt to get home as soon as practical.</p>

<p>Is there a way to prevent the fries becoming soft during this 10~15 minutes time frame, or a way to make them crispy again?</p>
","<p><strong>The key</strong> is to keep the fries away from moisture.</p>

<p><strong><em>Factor</strong> - The fry must stay crisp and tasty for at least as long as it takes to eat a full serving.</em></p>

<p>Fries that comes straight out of the fryer are almost always perfectly crisp. The true test of a great fry is whether or not it remains crisp and edible a few minutes later after it's been sitting on your plate.</p>

<p>Use of dehydrators or desiccant can keep the fries dry during your transit time.</p>

<p><strong><em>Warning:</em></strong> Many Dehydrator or desiccant should be used carefully as they are toxic in nature. I would not recommend silica or chemical based dehydrator/desiccant.</p>

<p><strong>Choice 1 -</strong> Crackers (or pieces thereof) can serve as an alternative desiccant. (Non-toxic and easily available)
<br>

<p><strong>Choice 2 -</strong> Salt is a natural dehumidifier. (Subject to weather conditions)</p>

<p>According to Transportation Information Service: Salt:</p>

<p>At up to 74% relative humidity and 20°C, salt does not absorb any appreciable quantities of water vapor. The critical water content of sodium chloride (NaCl) is 0.5% at 74% relative humidity, which is the flow moisture point at which salt begins readily to absorb water vapor, and increases such that, at 75% relative humidity, the salt dissolves.</p>

<p>Along with outdoor weather,  car internal weather condition is also a factor which contributes to the moisture level. </p>

<p>A <strong>desiccant</strong> is a hygroscopic substance that induces or sustains a state of dryness (desiccation) in its vicinity; It is the opposite of a humectant. Commonly encountered pre-packaged desiccants are solids that absorb water.</p>

","<p>It looks as though the magnet is stuck to a raised black metal piece, and ""above"" it is non-magnetic wood. My solution is to slide one end of the magnet ""up"", so it sticks out over the wood area. Once that tip is sticking out, you should be able to grab it with your fingers (or pliers) and lift it off the metal.</p>

<p>It will be even easier if you can prevent the other end from sliding farther down the black metal. You can do this by wedging something non-metallic in between that end of the magnet and the ""lower"" edge of the black metal.</p>

Equally, hand squeezing or wringing may alter the shape. After washing, take a large bath towel, lay the garment flat on the towel without over stretching it, roll the towel up with the garment inside, put the towel on a chair or the edge of the bath and sit on it all over.

"Vinyl Above Ground Pool - can't find leak - will renting a compressor work?","207","","<p>I have a 3.66m above ground vinyl pool, 1 season old, and I cant find the leak at all.</p>

<p>I've tried the food colour route, where one tries to trace the flow of the water by injecting small parts of blue food colour - cannot find it.</p>

<p>I've seen videos on youtube where the guy says one can hit on the bottom of the 
pool and bits of dirt will get sucked in - then you can see the dirt and identify the leak, but the pool is on a pool cover so there is no dirt.</p>

<p>The pool is only 10% filled now - until I can find the leak.</p>

<p>Will it work if I go and rent a small compressor and press the nozzle against the outside and look inside to where the bubbles are?
Its gonna cost a small amount (I'm not in the states but its about $15),
but its less than 10% of the price of a new pool.</p>

<p>I will to the sidewall first - it could be in the bottom creases - but I know its at the bottom because the pool is only 10% filled and its leaking.</p>

<p>The bottom will be a bit more interesting - i'll have to lift up the pool from the bottom and press against it - i'll prob have to get rid of most of the water in there now (not a lot) and when I do press it from the bottom , the water will then disperse to the sides and i'll have to try and get water on the exact spot above the nozzle again.</p>

<p>Will this work? Any tips? Any ideas for the bottom part (side is easy)

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>I don't think it's feasible to rent a small compressor and blow against the outside of your pool. The air will go the easiest way and that is <em>not</em> through the body of water within the pool. </p>

<p>If you should use air, you would need to flip it around so that the air could escape through water. Like in actually flipping the pool around and submerging it into a larger pool, partially filling it with water, and then see where the air flows out of your pool. Not easily done, though.</p>

<p>Assuming your leak is in the actual bottom, it could be an option to cover the bottom area with ordinary towels (between the vinyl cover and the pool), fill it up and let it stand for a while allowing some water to leak. If you then drain the pool, and carefully lift aside the bottom you should be able to locate the wet towel and find the leaky area. That would narrow your search down to a smaller area.</p>

<p>When finding the leaky area, you could try to further narrow it down by tapeing paper towels to the bottom of the pool in that area, and then refill that area with colored water. The leak should then be visible and easy to locate after just a few minutes with water in that area of the pool.</p>

<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I haven't actually tested these ideas, but in theory they should work! Hope it helps!</em></p>

"How to keep planted seeds watered permanently?","204","","<p>I have some parsley seeds which I want to plant. First of all, I want to plant them in my house then later when they are grown I want to put them in the garden. Many plants first need to grow in house. </p>

<p>So how can I keep them watered without having to water them by my own? I am afraid that sometimes I forget to water them. Is there a solution, perhaps with clay or something which holds the water?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>There are several ways to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Water globes:</strong></p>

<p>These are containers of water with a narrow opening that you fill and stick into the soil. Commercial ones can be very attractive, and advertise as keeping your plants watered ""for weeks"". I've never used them myself, but I have repeatedly heard that they are unlikely to keep your plant watered more than a single week, and require regular cleaning. They generally run from $9 to $20. You can also create your own with a bottle with a small hole; I suspect a large bottle with a pinprick hole may last longer, but I've never tried it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drip watering systems:</strong></p>

<p>Some of them have tanks and some work from faucets; most have an adjustable drip. They are more likely to last more than a week. The ones that use faucets seem to primarily be designed for outdoor use, so may be useful once the plants are transitioned outdoors, and many of these are designed for multiple pots. There are also drip hoses, but they are not really designed for what you seem to be doing. A quick google search found systems that ranged from about $19 to $99. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>A wick system:</strong></p>

<p>This uses a wick (a thread, strip of fabric, yarn, shoelace, or something similar) to wick water from a separate container of water to the soil of the planter, either at the top or the bottom of the pot. There are a couple of commercial products according to Google, but this is generally a do-it-yourself method. You will need some time to be sure your plant is getting the correct amount of water, and make adjustments as needed (usually by changing to a thicker or thinner wick). As a do-it-yourself, this will generally not run more than a couple of dollars, and may be effectively free if you already have what you need. (One word of warning: if you have a wick at the bottom of the pot and you run out of water in the container, the wick will pull water <strong>out</strong> of the pot. Putting a wick at the bottom of the pot that isn't connected to water is actually a suggested method to keep pots from waterlogging or for plants that need very good drainage.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The visual system:</strong></p>

<p>This involves keeping the plant somewhere that is both close to water and somewhere you will see it frequently. Next to or behind the sink works well for me; I can see when the plant looks like it needs water, and I don't have to stop what I'm doing to get water for it. It does require a plant that can survive drying out to the point where the need for water is visible on a regular basis. A moisture detector of some sort can help with this whether it's an actual meter of some sort or a terra cotta 'worm' that changes color as the soil moisture changes. It's free, or the cost of whatever you use to track soil moisture, but your results may vary.</p></li>

"Tips to find misplaced keys somewhere in my house","204","","<p>Today when I woke up I couldn't find my keys (car + car alarm + house + job + key chain, all together).</p>

<p>I <em>know</em> that they should be somewhere around my house or garage, because last night I returned home driving. I always try to leave them on my desk, but couldn't find them there.</p>

<p>I searched like crazy in the morning, but with no success (was stressed out and running late). <strong>What alternatives do I have to effectively search and find my lost keys?</strong></p>

<p>I already plan to search everywhere again with calm mindset, and try to recall where they could be, but I wonder if there is a more effective or efficient way of doing it, as I am short on ideas (taking advantage of the fact that they are metallic/electronic, perhaps). </p>

<p>What do you suggest?</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> I also thoroughly checked inside my car (luckily the window was halfway down to open it), but no success again.</p>
","<p>Someone I know would advise you to look in the fridge first. (And if you are a hot drink drinker, around the kettle or coffee machine.)</p>

<p>Seriously, walk the way through the house as you would have done when getting out of the car after the last time you had your keys.<br>
Look at all surfaces you pass, that is also on the floor, each of the tables and chairs and if you put away shopping the shelving those are stored.</p>

<p>If that first walk does not work, get down to get your eye at floor level and look under the furniture, take a strong flashlight and shine on floor level. It works best if you have someone helping you, as a person away from the source of light has a different view which can be very helpful.<br>
And feel between and under the cushions on your sofa and comfy seat, under your dining chairs and so on.</p>

<p>And if you have someone in the house with you, ask them to do a tour of your walking route as well, with all the extra looking on the surfaces.</p>

<p>Your walk that day ended (most likely) with you stepping in your bed and under the bed and between the bedding is also a great place for keys to hide.
So do not forget to look there.</p>

"Does anyone know of a 'homemade' sunscreen?","201","","<p>I've heard of many 'DIY' solutions for other household products over the years (eg <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Homemade-Glass-Cleaner-Recipe/"" rel=""nofollow"">window cleaner</a> and beauty products) but never for sunscreen. </p>

<p>I doubt there is a homemade sunscreen that could come close to factor 50+ sunscreen however any is better than none at all...! Is there such a thing? </p>
","<p>I assume when you say sunscreen you mean sunscreen lotion, as in putting on your skin. According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>, the ingredients that actually block the UV radiation in sunscreen lotion are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium_dioxide"" rel=""nofollow"">titanium dioxide</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_oxide"" rel=""nofollow"">zinc oxide</a>, and these metallic powders are mixed with a heavy oil to make a lotion that doesn't wash (or sweat) off easily.</p>

<p>Commercial lotions may also have some other organic chemicals that also block UV, but not to the same extent that titanium and zinc powder do. </p>

<p>Although the type of oil you mix into a home made recipe version is up to you, you will probably need to buy one or both titanium dioxide powder or zinc oxide powder to use if you plan on mixing your own. The only health risk of DIY sunscreen is inhaling the powders prior to mixing them in oil; this is not healthy for you but neither chemical is poisonous. One other disadvantage of homebrewed sunblock is you may end up looking like you are covered in white paste depending on how thick you smear it on yourself.</p>

<p>I checked Amazon for prices and food grade titanium dioxide powder runs about $20 a pound, and zinc oxide powder goes for half that.</p>

","<p>Are the electrical light sockets also colored? If they're then I would guess they would be made of a different material than the wire insulation. So the dye may work for one and not the other. I don't think wire insulation can be dyed but I cold be wrong.</p>

<p>Have you considered wrapping the wire in colored tape. This could get pricey but it's a simple solution.</p>

<p>One last option is to buy wire loom in large quantities. This is relatively cheap compared to other suggestions and it can be bought in many colors. The split in the loom will be enough to pull each light out. </p>

I've saved every bank statement, every bill, every home insurance letter, basically everything piece of mail that wasn't a credit card offer. My desk is a mess and it's totally overwhelming, I want to be able to use my desk again, but aside from throw everything into a folder, I have no idea of how to start organizing it. When I was living with my parents, I just had a three ring binder that I organized my taxes and a few other odds and ends in, but being a home owner comes with a tremendous amount of monthly paperwork, and I'm not sure how to start on getting it organized. Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>After some searching I found an excellent system. Obviously, you probably need to start with a filing cabinet, but alphabetical order won't help much because of all the different files, and for one credit card related file, you might put ""Credit card"" and on another you might put ""Amazon card"", and they would get filed completely differently regardless of the heading you put on them. I've found that using differently colored hanging file folders as seperators works well for me, I have several simple one word headings for various subjects on the colored folders, while items of that subject type go behind the folder. I went ahead and cut the colored folders in half - I don't want to file directly into those folders, they are simply organizers. Here is a photo of my example. Hope it helps anyone with the same issue.</p>

<p><strong>Any tricks on how to speed up the boot?</strong></p>
","<p>You have a variety of choices depending on your time, budget, and tech-fu:</p>

<ol>
<li>Replace your hard drive with an <strong>SSD</strong> will certainly be a big win.  Your laptop will boot faster and apps will open faster and it is quieter and uses less power.  This also brings other side benefits I will mention later.</li>
<li>Adding more <strong>RAM</strong> will be a decent win.  Things will generally go faster, and you will be able to do more things at once before your laptop slows down.  This is easier than replacing your hard drive, but it won't have nearly the same effect.</li>
<li>While it is more true with Windows than MacOS, you will still get some help from merely <strong>reinstalling the OS</strong>.  Reinstalling will clean our a certain amount of BS that accumulates as software is installed and updated.</li>
<li><strong>Uninstall apps</strong> you no longer need or use.</li>
<li><strong>Review startup settings.</strong>  Even after you've installed something maybe you don't want it to start on its own.  VPNs and software updaters are necessary, but you may not want them so much that it slows down your startup time.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would avoid software that claims to speed your computer up for you.  Some of it may be helpful, but most of it is a waste of money.</p>

<p>IKEA hacks, DIY solutions, &amp; creative ideas are much appreciated.</p>
","<p>I'll assume the camera is directly in front of you.  Position a floor lamp with a transparent/translucent white lampshade a few feet to the left of it, and a foot or two above it.  If the light is too straight-on your face will look flat on camera. Since the light will make the lampshade ""glow"", the light will be softer (instead of a stark bare bulb that casts crisp shadows).  The white walls will also reflect light onto the rest of you, making it look softer but still directional.  If you want a little more punchy lighting, you could also place a lamp with a bare bulb directly to your right and even a little bit behind you. (I've been making and lighting videos for 10 years.)</p>

<p>Get a phone headset.  That should eliminate most of the room noise, since the mic will be very close to your mouth.  DO NOT use speaker phone; that mic would always be too far from your mouth and will pick up way too much room noise and echo.</p>

<p>Behind you, just place a book case that contrasts with the walls (so a darker color) and put a plant on it, off center.  For more interest you could place the dark book case with the plant on it off to one side of the video frame, and have a similarly-colored or complimentary-colored chair on the other side of the video frame. Asymmetry with balance is always pleasant to look at, but you don't want your background to be distracting.</p>

Fungi and molds not only leave behind an annoying smell but can be effect the health, they can cause breathing problems and allergies.  So when I leave the room for two three days closed, it's a perfect environment to fungus. So when I back it's really hard to stay in the room due to the annoying smell. I need any solution which helps to avoid fungus.</p>
","<p>First of all, if humidity is a recurrent problem, you might want to consider investing in a dehumidifier, some might seem costly but they are really worth it, I bought one for 75 dollars for my parents' house, the ambience has improved so much and my mom's health as well(as you mention, the constant humidity made my mom sick, she had fungus stored in her lungs and it took at least 5 months for her to be back at 100% health) </p>

<p>So I can tell you how beneficial would a dehumidifier will be for you, the first couple of weeks you might have to use it on a daily basis, since humidity percentage is going to be at a high percentage. But afterwards, you'll only have to use it 1 to 3 times per week to keep it at the level you want.</p>

<p>Now for the current fungi and mold in your house, make a weak to mild mix of water with bleach, and scrub away. It's a tedious task, but beneficial in the long run. </p>

<p>Most of the answers contain visual distinctions (nail polish, permanent markers, colored key caps, stickers, spray paint, etc.). Drilling holes and filing notches into the keys were recommended, but this is a hassle and requires special tools.</p>
","<p>The geometrical approach:</p>

<p>For someone who does not want to modify the key itself, use a deliberate disorder:</p>

<p>If all keys are on one ring, have all keys oriented in the same direction, the one to be found in the dark in the opposing direction.</p>

<p>For multiple rings like in your question, put the special key on it's own ring. If more keys are alone on a ring, use a short ""chain"" of <em>two</em> rings so that the one is singeled out or slip a tiny object like a bead onto the key ring. This should not add much bulk to the key ring like a special pendant might.</p>

"How can I stop biting my nails while I think?","180","","<p>I'm a nail biter, and have been for around 15 years now, and I like caffeine, which makes the problem worse since I do it as a ""fidget"", instead of as a direct result of stress.</p>

<p>I've been coding for a few hours today, and have already worn down my nails from when I need to stop and think about what I'm writing.</p>

<p>I tried chewing gum, which helped a lot, but most gum contains artificial sweeteners which upset my gut. My teeth also aren't perfect, so I'd like to avoid chewing sugared-gum.</p>

","<p>It looks like it is scale, which is build up chalk.
As with all scale, vinegar and lemon juice, among other things, will get rid of it.</p>

<p>Best option might be cleaning strength vinegar but all different kinds of vinegar as well as many kinds of lemon and lime juice will clean scale. I expect there are commercially made cleaners that will do the job, based on other accids as well as those I mention.</p>

<p>For as strong build up as this I would use a bit of undiluted vinegar or lemon juice on a bit of cloth or paper and just rub it on, wash it off after with plenty of water.<br>
When using a commercial cleaner, follow instructions on the packaging. Some might be so much stronger that gloves are needed.</p>

<p>If it was clear glass I would submerge it in a vinegar solution, but some mirror backings, some glues and some frame materials will not do well in that.</p>

<p>To avoid a new build up, clean off your mirror after every use in which it gets wet. If the water where you live is hard (contains a lot of chalk) it might be needed to use a wipe with a bit of vinegar or lemon juice.  </p>

<p>A lifehack to avoid water staying on the mirror is to wipe it with a little soap. Just a tiny bit, and wipe it off with a dry cloth or piece of paper.<br>

<p>Other alternatives are nematode applications which target slugs, yet don't harm anything from soil to other creatures, but they aren't a cheap solution.</p>

<p>What I'd recommend is a wood filler (even in France, you should be able to get those at do-it-yourself retailers).  Hopefully what the kids put in the gouge wasn't waxy or oily; if it's just something like marker (rather than crayon), you can just fill the gouge with wood filler, apply a marker or scratch hider (which is pretty much a wood-colored crayon -- they come in a lot of shades so you can match your wood), and let it all dry.</p>

<p>If the coloring in the gouge is crayon or something oily, you'll need to take off a layer of wood to remove the color and leave bare wood, or the wood filler won't adhere.  Then proceed as above -- following the directions on the package of wood filler you buy.</p>

<h3>Fixing a Dent in Wood</h3>

<p>If it <em>were</em> just a dent (wood compressed instead of missing), you could likely repair it by poking a number holes with a sewing needle, soaking water into the wood, covering it with a damp cloth or paper towel, and heating with a clothing iron or soldering iron.  The heat will soften the wood enough to let the steam formed (from the water that's soaked in via the holes) expand the crushed grain, restoring most of the lost volume.  Then, if needed, you'd finish with a wood filler, but the less of that you need, generally, the better.</p>

<p>Another option is to do what my parents did after I (at age 4) rode my tricycle into the coffee table my dad made in a college shop class: leave the gouge and tell everyone who noticed the story of how it was my fault.  By the time I was 7, I'd gotten so tired of hearing that story that I'd become much more careful of the furniture...</p>

"Cleaning a mouth retainer","165","","<p>I got my braces removed about a year ago and I wear my retainers every night now. I was advised to gently wash my retainers in cold water. However, doing so does not clean the retainer of plaque. </p>

<ol>
<li>I have tried brushing it with my tooth brush but it doesn't clean it properly. Now, the plaque is just building into a think over-coating. </li>

<li>I tried soaking it over-night in a cup of listerine and then seeing if it brushed off.</li>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Result of @FlatBanana's answer: I soaked my retainer for about 8 hours in a cup of water and a table spoon of baking soda. When I pulled them out, although they were not completely clean, brushing them with some toothpaste made the plaque come out much more easily. So, for now, this is the best solution I have found so far. </p>
","<p>I would suggest using baking soda and castile soap.  Whenever you are not wearing them soak them in distilled water with a little bit of baking soda, the castile soap will help to give them a fresher smell.</p>

<p>After soaking, I would suggest you brush them to remove any leftover baking soda.</p>

"How to repair synthetic nylon pouch","165","","<p>I've got a zipper pouch made of synthetic material (it feels like nylon but I'm not entirely certain) which is partly made of a loose ""mesh"" weave:</p>

<h2>Previous attempts</h2>

<p>I haven't done anything to try to fix it yet because I have no idea how to fix it --- hence posting this question online.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>I am terrible at sewing but can do it, and am also willing to learn new skills in order to fix the pouch --- hence posting this question online.</p>
","<p>I think there is two ways you can fix this.</p>

<p>1) Cut a piece of material slightly bigger than the hole in the mesh and stick it with a strong glue... i.e. open the pocket, put your hand in it with a piece of wood with the material being on the wood. With your other hand, take another piece of flat wood and push them together. Hopefully that does the job as the material should prevent future rips in the materials.</p>

<p>2) Sewing... try to sow the rips together, pulling the thread through the opposite sides of the rip, going all the way around. The problem with this is that you will end up with a thick line (one you complete the fix), but it will do the job if done correctly.</p>

<p>Either way, this is a hard fix as you will be able to see were the rip has happened in the past.</p>

Any help??? </p>
","<p><strong>just talk!!!</strong> its that simple.  And don't care what others think, if you spend your life always questioning what others will think when you say or do something, then you won't every live your life and you won't be able to accomplish your goals in life.  So why waste time, caring what others will say about you, just do you and don't worry about what anyone will say. Just like the Nike sign: ""Just Do It""</p>

<p>Right now your young and for you, your whole world is your school and your family but as you grow up and go to college and on to bigger and better things you will see that stuff you worried about as a kid, won't matter and will be like a joke because you will see that what you thought was important as a kid doesn't matter and all that matters is your true happiness. So if that means expressing your ideas and giving a speech in front of thousands of people even though you might have a lisp, if thats what makes you happy then do it, and don't care how people will react because that doesn't matter. what matters is your happiness.</p>

<p>Plus in realty everyone is so busy with their own problems that goes on in their own lives they don't actually pay attention to other stuff. best example is to check out the book: ""how to win friends and influence people"" by Dale carnegie. in first chapter he tells you that.

This can sometimes help because of luck. Of course, after applying a lubricant, you can surely try this out.</li>
<li>Select an extremely small drill bit and try it in the middle of the screw, also take care to apply low power and pressure. Use pliers for your help. Of course, you would not be using this screw again as it can cause you similar harm when you unscrew. So opting this solution is also advisable.</li>

I tried washing them several times, both with detergent and with baking soda, and then putting them in the dryer with fabric softener. Unfortunately the sheets remain stiff. How can I get these sheets to soften?</p>
","<p>First of all: 400 thread cottons that are ""scratchy"" should be returned.</p>

<p>Second: <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/a/17547/21979"">Maneesh's answer</a> is way better than the current votes reflect. Vinegar is the most effective and safe for most cotton fabrics, most colours, the washing machine and the environment. (It also helps to protect the washer from built-up residue.)</p>

<hr>

<p>That said, this is mainly to be read as a small addition to Maneesh's answer about chemicals.</p>

<p>Cotton, especially heavy cotton in canvas style (plain weave) or jeans (twill) or similar styles <em>are</em> quite stiff when brand new. That is a feature. </p>

<p>To break the stiffness you need to break some fibres and loosen the weave. Chemical fabric softeners are one way.</p>

<p>Washing them intensely (long cycle <em>and</em> high heat) is the method the industry uses. To amplify the effect add some tumble <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryer_ball"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dryer balls</a> (those plastic things looking like chestnuts on LSD) or <a href=""https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/housekeeping/279439-tumble-dryer-balls-do-they-work"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">just something like tennis balls</a>  into the washing machine <em>and</em> the dryer. Quality cotton can withstand cooking temperatures. Some colours on that fabric might not. White sheets can go all the way.</p>

<p>Ageing the fabric softens it. Quality fabric will last long after this breaking in with physical or chemical stresses. That means of course to not do this every time you wash, just in the beginning.</p>

","<p>We use entirely different sets of colours for different purposes. Right now, the newest cloths are solid earth tones. These are for dishes, wiping counters, wiping tables. In the same (kitchen) cupboard, but a separate stack, we keep the striped cloths that we use for the floor. Upstairs, in each bathroom, we keep a small supply of the pastel cloths (some with holes in them or frayed edges) that we use for the toilet.  And in the box with the pool supplies we keep the white ones we use to wipe the pool when brown sulphur stuff appears at the waterline.</p>

<p>We put all of these into the laundry, and when they come out we fold them and put them where they belong. You can't accidentally grab the wrong one, and if there's a damp cloth near the kitchen sink I know whether or not it was used on the floor, and don't accidentally reuse it for a counter.</p>

<p>Some time in the future all my cloths will be that much older. The bathroom ones will be so worn out that half of them have been thrown away. I will buy another dozen or so that, while they may not all be the same colour, are a collection or pattern that is not the same as any I own at the time, throw out the pastel ones, move the striped ones to bathroom duty, the earth tones to floor duty, and use the new ones for dishes and counters. We've been doing this for decades and it's simple, easy, and pretty foolproof - the worst that can happen is that someone will use a clean cloth from the kitchen cupboard for the wrong purpose. We don't leave floor cloths lying around when we have visitors, and visitors don't clean our floor or bathroom, so it works just fined</p>

","<p>Flatbread is brittle and breaks easily as you already know.</p>

<p>The object of the packaging is to get the flatbread to you in good condition. If the packaging had enough space to allow you remove one piece undamaged, it would be loose enough for the pieces knock against each other in transit and break. Most likely, experience has shown ""sacrifice"" packaging is optimal insofar as the product is concerned.</p>

<p>Sacrifice packaging is bad news as far as you're concerned because it is engineered to preserve the product by ""sacrificing"" the container. You are working at cross-purposes with the manufacturer.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Cellophane is used which is biodegradable but it becomes increasingly brittle as it ages.</p>

<p>• You could try to pull one from the centre with a pair of thin tweezers or tiny tongs while vibrating the package. The vibrations may allow you to slide the first one free.</p>

<p>• You could try to crack one slice into pieces with a knife. That might let you get the rest of the slices free remaining intact.</p>

<p>• You could try first pulling two-or-three at a time by gripping the edges and, if successful, replace the ones you don't want back into the package. </p>

<p>• You might have to bite the bullet (so to speak) and try carefully opening the package from the end and folding it closed afterward.</p>

<p>• Lastly, you may have little choice but to reuse the whole cardboard container to hold the rest of the torn package you are using day-to-day. Failing that, you might have to cave-in and go with another kind of reusable container.</p>

"How to get rid of pantry moths?","150","","<p>For the past few months I've had pantry moths in my flat. At first very few but they grew in number. I tried some traps and they catch quite a few but it is not enough. I threw away all my infected food and bought them anew and put them in a new location. Additionally to that, I cleaned basically everything and closed up all holes in my cupboard. That helped a lot but they found a way to infest my new hiding place and now I am afraid that they will spread anew.</p>

<p>Do you know any way to get rid of them once and for all?</p>
","<p>To get rid of a pantry moth infestation is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the moths, their larva, and their eggs.</li>
<li>Prevent them to come back.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first step you already succeeded by <strong>throwing away</strong> all possibly infected food, <strong>seal their hiding</strong> places, and prevent them to mate by setting up <strong>pheromone traps</strong> to catch all males.</p>

<p>Things to consider</p>

<ul>
<li>really, really be generous in throwing away all food if you want to be sure. Moth eggs are too small for our eyes to see.  Store food you want to keep i nthe freezer (this will kill the eggs).</li>
<li>clean all and everything from cans to cupboard to remove all possible eggs.  </li>
<li>We will not get rid of 100% of all moths. They hide in the weirdest places (I found them sitiing in my kitchen radio) but if you catch all males in the traps then after all their life cycles went through they will not be able to spawn. Make sure to set up fresh pheromone traps regularly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now here is the harder bit. We don't want them back. Moths will enter your clean kitchen from the outside, from your neighbours cupboards, or from litter bins around your flat. Little we can do here. But quite often we will find that food from one supermarket is much more affected than from another. Therefore:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>change your grocery store</strong></li>
<li>watch out for infected food before you buy it (webbing often is the clue)</li>
<li>store food that often harboured moths in the past in the freezer (it was the ground almonds for me).</li>
<li>always store all food in air-tight containers after you had opened the packaging.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, when living in a city they will come back sooner or later. Get used to set up traps from early spring to late autumn.</p>

"How to Scare Crows that Peck My Cloth Drying Ropes?","150","","<p>I dry my clothes on open balcony. I have metal bars facing each other from far and holding 5 ropes. I have these crows landing and constantly pecking certain spot on one of ropes. I am sleeping in the room next to balcony and am looking for ideas on how to scare away crows without disturbing my sleep. FYI I am outside of US if your solution involves supplies that can only be purchased there. Thanks.</p>
","<p>This could be a fun project, especially since in terms of brain/body mass ratios we are up against a very worthy opponent</p>

<h2>Know thy enemy</h2>

<p>Crows in particular are very intelligent birds. Recent studies have shown that birds of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae?wprov=sfla1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Corvidae</em></a> family  demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests (European magpies) and tool-making ability (crows, rooks)—skills until recently regarded as solely the province of humans and a few other higher mammals. Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to that of great apes and cetaceans, and only slightly lower than in humans.</p>

<p>The <em>Corvidae</em> family includes crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers </p>

<h2>Survey the battlefield</h2>

<p>If a murder of crows has set eyes on modifying your property for their benefit, you will need to identify other areas that they may be probing or pecking around. They seldom insist on certain isolated objectives, and your clothesline may be only one of several projects on the bird's mind. Do make sure there is no place where they are nesting, as this has detrimental effects on your properties' finishes, roofing and specially waterproofing. </p>

<p>Once you have identified areas of concern, you can select the solution that fits your needs and budget.</p>

<h2>Choose your weapons</h2>

<p>On your local home improvement store you may find different products you can select to protect the areas of concern around your property. Your choices:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Decoys</strong> a Hawk decoy, correctly placed and moved regularly will be somewhat effective until the birds catch on to the trick. If you don't move the decoy frequently, and dealing with crows that can be surprisingly faster that we might expect. You don't want to end up  owning a proverbial scarecrow with crows sitting on top of it. You need to combine the decoys with another solution below:</li>
<li><strong>Bird Spikes</strong> these are particularly effective if you can cover the place where they need to stand to Peck at your clothesline. Like all good things they come in different materials, sizes and colors, so they don't end up ruining the sightlines of your property. Stainless steel spikes are quite durable and a bit more expensive, but only come in stainless steel color. Plastic spikes will need to be replaced every two years, depending on placement, since exposure tends to degrade and make plastic brittle. They are less expensive and come in different colors, so you can mix and match with the surrounding architecture</li>
<li><strong>Physical Barriers</strong> Use wire nets, or landscaping nets or even wood structures o masonry to make cozy nesting places inaccessible to the birds.</li>
<li><strong>Active deterrents</strong> there may be other solution, either Sonic, mechanical, or electric, however I'd only consider them if you had a major bird problem.(Think Saint Mark's Cathedral in Venice) or as a last resort I since these solution will inflict injury or harm on living creatures: (v.gr, high voltage low current wires that shock birds as they step on​ them, motion sensor activated loudspeakers  that scare birds when tripped, or moving blades that actually shove or hit the birds if standing on their path.)</li>
<li><strong>Chemical solution</strong> there are some Chloride salt compounds that are specifically designed as bird repellent. You need to get the right one for your kind of bird, since something that stinks like the stink of death to one bird species, may smell like dinner's ready to others. These solutions are usually temporary since weather will reduce their effectiveness and there may be environmental concerns. </li>
</ul>

<p>I think a combination of bird spikes and strategic netting are the most effective </p>

<p>Here are some images of the products:</p>

<h2>Roll your own</h2>

<p>Once you understand they bird spikes work because they make an area unavailable for landing/standing to the birds much in the same way a thorny bush would, you can come up with a way to deploy pointy stuff of your own manufacture and creativity confirming to your skills and available tooling and material. A good guideline can be the CAD files that <a href=""http://www.birdbgone.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Bird-b-gone, Inc. Professional avian control"">this company</a> provides and their extensive product literature available for download</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>FULL DISCLOSURE</strong> I did some IT work for them back in 2000, as an external solutions vendor, and I was fascinated with their manufacture process for such a niche market product </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Fun facts</h2>

<p>Even though it was only recently observed that crows are way more intelligent than we tought, (self awareness is no small feat! Only humans, some great primates and dolphins were believed to be self-aware ) they have always caused some sense or uneasiness to humans. They were widely regarded as birds if bad omen throughout European cultures and that uneasiness reflects even today on a variety Languages that have a distinct word for a group of crows as opposed to q group of any other birds: in English, we have a <strong>Flock</strong> of birds, and a <strong>Murder</strong> of crows, in Spanish the words are <strong>Parvada</strong> and <strong>Pandilla</strong> respectively. I believe that this uneasiness about crows rises from our collective subconscious being aware of these birds cunningness, even if we consciously dismissed them as only ""bird-sized-brains"" creatures.</p>

<p>So there. Hope this helps.</p>

I have a lot of snacks and am keen on buying more snacks quicker than I could eat.</p>

<p>Since I never have a good habit organizing them, I often find myself regretting - So how should I organize them effectively?</p>
","<p>Group by expiry date, for sure - once they're past that, you'll just be putting them in the bin, so the point, surely, is to have them in date order so you know what must be eaten first, that's the priority, regardless of the product. That's the way products are stacked on supermarket shelves, with the shortest dated produce to the front, longer at the back. Admittedly, theirs are grouped by the product, then the date, but you've got, presumably, a random selection available, so in those circumstances, the date is the consideration.</p>

<p>As an aside, I'd also say don't buy so many snacks, that'd make life a lot easier (and healthier, probably). And don't shop when you're hungry, you'd be surprised how much easier it is to walk straight past snack type food and only buy what you need when you've got a full stomach.</p>

"Household reference for measuring accuracy of an oral thermometer?","148","","<p>I purchased a $10 Relion 2-second digital oral clinical thermometer and it appears to be completely unreliable. It is off 0.5 - 1.0&deg; F on successive measurements (even with proper delay) and differs from another digital thermometer by 0.5 - 1.0&deg; F.</p>

<p>Is there something commonly available around the house that generates a precise temperature to calibrate this oral thermometer? </p>

<p>Typically you can calibrate a digital thermometer using an ice bath, but clinical digital thermometers typically only operate in the 90 - 110&deg; F (35 - 42 C) range. I see that the melting point of gallium at 85&deg; F, but I don't have any gallium around the house and the boiling point of water is too high for this thermometer. I thought about throwing together a resistance heated reference but quickly discovered that gets complex. Unfortunately, I do not have a mercury-filled glass thermometer for comparison. </p>
","<p>There isn't a high precision temperature reference in the range you want.  Wood's Metal and Field's Metal (melting points 158F and 144F respectively) melt too hot, and mercury melts much too cold (-40F).  Gallium is readily available (among other things, in the form of a gag spoon that melts in your hand), but very expensive for what should be a single use.</p>

<p>The best option I can suggest is to buy a second digital thermometer ""to keep the first one honest"".  If they agree, you can be pretty confident the reading is correct.  Worth noting that there are few instances where as little as a half degree F in body temperature is significant -- for a 98.6 ""normal"", you'd have to be above 100 F to be considered to have a fever.</p>

<p>Since you already know by comparison that the $10 unit is questionable, I'd recommend just returning it to the place of purchase for a refund, as ""defective"".</p>

"How long is a piece of [shoe] string?","148","","<p>My shoe laces seem to wear out quite often. However, all my shoes have different numbers of eyelets and some even have hooks.</p>

<p>As stores have laces sealed and just sold by stating how long they are, is there a rule of thumb for getting the right length of shoelaces on the first purchase?</p>
","<p>I don't know if this qualifies as a hack, but just do the math:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You need to have two ends to tie together of a somewhat appropriate length, estimated at 4 times the distance between the eyelet columns, or find a given constant you are satisified with</p></li>
<li><p>The laces needs cross over at the bottom and top of the eyelets, that is twice for each pair of eyelets</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In other words, given 6 pairs of eyelets, and an approx distance between the left and right column of eyelets to be 5 cm (or 2 inches), you'll get a formula like the following:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>lace for tieing plus number of eyelets, multiplied with the distance between eyelet columns</li>
  <li>For 12 eyelet pairs with a distance of 5 cm (or 2 inches) this would give ""2*4 + 12"" multiplied with 5 cm (or 2 inches) giving 100 cm (or 40 inches)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Another way of putting this is: <strong><em>Start of with 40 cm (or 16 inches) and add 10 cm (or 4 inches) for each pair of eyelets</em></strong> </p>

<p><strong>But,</strong> your safest bet is simply to pull out either the one lace which are still intact, or the two pieces of broken lace and simply measure the length.</p>

","<p>REVIEW: It is important to isolate the air conditioner air flow. Air conditioners work by producing heat as part of the ""cooling"" process. Hot air is pushed out of one side and cool air from the other. Keep the hot part out of your area as much as possible. Often, the hot air tubes become radiant heaters, themselves. Keep them as short as possible and insulate them if possible.</p>

<p>The doors into the room appear to be close together. If the doors open into a hallway or into a common room, that area will become a larger room to cool, in effect.</p>

<p>If the adjacent room is cooler than yours, the fan alone in the doorway will equalize the temperature by recirculating and mixing the air with both doors open. If not close the door to reduce the load on your air conditioner.</p>

<p>The Fan: Once you have isolated yourself in your environment, position the fan to create optimal air circulation within the room by having all the air moving in the same direction. Try putting it against the centre of a wall so that air is pushed around the room in as smooth a circular pattern as possible.</p>

","<p>The simplest and most hacky one: 
Hang them off a string, so gravity can pull them straight over time (one to a couple of weeks depending on wood and bend).

<p>From own experience I know that wood will bend easier when you <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_bending"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heat it up</a>.</p>

<p>Having said that, wood is a grown material where you have rarely a consistent quality of wood in a piece. This means on change of humidity and temperature the queue could just bend and straighten. This is especially true for mass manufactured wares. An experienced queue turner probably selects pieces based on his experience where he would expect little to no bend; these would be a lot more expensive than their mass manufactured counter parts. </p>

<p>The bottom line is, some queues just will be more difficult than others. </p>

<p>If your queues are from mass manufacturing, you may want to do what the <em>big boys</em> do these days and just select the better queues out and charge more money for them. </p>

<p>Does anyone know a simple design?</p>
","<p>Your baskets likely need two or more points of connection, which can be the top corners but in some cases you can use a series of points in a vertical line in the middle. With some very sturdy baskets you can get away with just one point of connection, when using a rigid frame, but do check for droop and twisting of the basket itself.</p>

<p>Once you have decided how you can or have to connect the baskets to your frame you can start thinking up what your frame will look like.</p>

<p>I am a knots person and my initial reaction is to use rope, connecting the baskets on their ends to the ropes.<br>
Which will then allow you to compress it while off the door but expand and give plenty of access when on the door.<br>
To make this kind of hanger you either need two ropes with a hook to attach it at the top of each, or easier, one rope folded double with an eye in the middle. The way they handle the <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Rope-Ladder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rope in this rope ladder</a> shows what I try to say.</p>

Or you can just use one basket which is big enough for your needs.</p>

<p>If you can attach a hook or nail to the door you can easily just use a loop or eye.<br>
Otherwise you will have to add a hook that hooks over the top of the door. You can bend on from a flat piece of metal, as long as the metal is strong enough to hold the shape.<br>

"How do I bend cheese?","144","","<p>My friend told me that cheese could be bent and there is foldable cheese. I've tried folding it but it breaks, I tried heating it slightly but it still breaks.
How can I fold cheese?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>Your friend was teasing you. Not all cheeses can be folded. You will probably have the greatest success with ""KRAFT™"" process cheese due to its plastic consistency. (Maybe that stuff <strong><em>IS</em></strong> plastic.) Fermented or natural brick cheeses like cheddar are too dry or flakey to slice thin enough to fold. Some foldable cheese needs to be put on a sheet of parchment paper before it is folded. Then, by folding the parchment you avoid the break. You cannot get a sharp crease with cheese, as it will break when you push down on the fold. At best, all you can expect is a loose round fold. After you fold the cheese a first time, there is no way to fold it again unless you put butter, margarine, or some lubricant to allow the cheese layers to slide upon each other as it is folded or it will break. Warming the cheese will help somewhat. Yellow process cheese folds more easily than the white. Swiss process cheese is the bendyest(?) of all. When you get more practice, cheese origami is a demanding artform practiced by very few. (I am kidding about the origami with cheese; but, who knows?)</p>

"Measuring alcohol in system","144","","<p>Where I live new drivers can't have any alcohol in their system while driving. So if you blow anything above 0 this is a fail. I have never taken a breathalyzer and have no clue how long alcohol takes to go through system. For example, if I had 1 beer at lunch and am driving somewhere at 8:00 PM that does seem a bit excessive. Is there anyway to know what your alcohol content is? Obviously I'm not trying to bypass drinking and driving laws, I'm trying to comply with them. </p>
","<p>I would say short of buying something which can check your breath you would have to work it out manually.</p>

<p>If you waited 6-8 hours after drinking a pint of ale or lager i would say it would be safe, but how quickly it leaves your system is different for everyone.</p>

<p>The NHS published this below in regards to how long it takes to break down alcohol. You can read the full article <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/853.aspx?CategoryID=87"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On average, it takes about one hour for your body to break down one unit of alcohol. However, this can vary, depending on:
  your weight
  whether you're male or female
  your age
  how quickly or slowly your body turns food into energy (your metabolism)
  how much food you have eaten
  the type and strength of the alcohol
  whether you're taking medication and, if so, what type
  It can also take longer if your liver isn't working normally</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At <a href=""http://respectyourself.org.uk/how-long-does-alcohol-stay-in-my-system/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Respect Yourself</a> they roughly claim</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>under 8 units: number of units + 1 hour (2 pints lager = 6 units, so
  7 hours) </li>
  <li>8-11 units: number of units + 1.5 hours (3 large glasses of
  wine = 9 units, so 10.5 hours) </li>
  <li>12 units plus: number of units x 1.5
  (5 pints lager/glasses wine = 15 units, so 22.5 hours)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Remeber, though, nothing is certain and the person testing you won't care that you waited x hours if you still have it in your system.</p>

<p>You can read more on units of alcohol <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/alcohol-units.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> but heres an image from the page. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mQsW2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mQsW2.jpg"" alt=""list of alcoholic drinks and their units""></a></p>

<p>You can work out the units manually following the information from the NHS</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using units is a simpler way of representing a drink's alcohol content – usually expressed by the standard measure ABV, which stands for alcohol by volume.
  ABV is a measure of the amount of pure alcohol as a percentage of the total volume of liquid in a drink.
  You can find the ABV on the labels of cans and bottles, sometimes written as ""vol"" or ""alcohol volume"" or you can ask bar staff about particular drinks.
  For example, wine that says ""12% ABV"" or ""alcohol volume 12%"" means that 12% of the volume of that drink is pure alcohol.
  You can work out how many units there are in any drink by multiplying the total volume of a drink (in ml) by its ABV (which is measured as a percentage) and dividing the result by 1,000.
  Strength (ABV) x volume (ml) ÷ 1,000 = units.
  For example, to work out the number of units in a pint (568ml) of strong lager (ABV 5.2%):
  5.2 (%) x 568 (ml) ÷ 1,000 = 2.95 units</p>

  <ol>
  <li>On AWS, create a new EC2 instance. Use defaults everywhere except as mentioned below:</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>*Base image should be Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base (since Windows still has all the best games)</p>
  
  <p>*Windows Server 2012 R2</p>
  
  <p>*Select an instance with the hardware configuration that closest matches your needs.</p>
  
  <p>*Use a Spot instance, it’s significantly cheaper (fractions the regular cost) than regular instances. Note cost will vary depending on
  region. I usually bid a penny more.</p>
  
  <p>*For the storage step, leave everything at the defaults. This will provision a 35GB EBS drive where your OS will live, and a 65GB
  SSD-backed instance-store (which is super fast and where the games
  will go). This instance-store will be available as a Z:\ drive.</p>
  
  <p>*For the Security Group, I’d recommend creating one that has 3 rules: one that allows All TCP, one that allows All UDP and one that
  allows All ICMP. Source should be from Anywhere for all 3. Yes, its
  not maximum security, but with the VPNs you’ll be setting up, it’ll be
  very convenient.</p>
  
  <p>*Finally, for the Key Pair, create a new one since you’ll need one for Windows (to retrieve the Administrator password later)</p>
  
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>Once your machine has spun up, get the Windows password using your private key. Connect via Microsoft Remote Desktop and add the
  details in there. Also make sure to select Connect to admin session to
  avoid GPU detection troubles. Note that your first connection might
  have a black screen for about a minute as it creates your user
  profile.</li>

<p>Can I do this on my own or should I had the knife to a professional knife sharpener?</p>
","<p>What I have seen from knife sharpeners, I would try it myself rather than going to them.</p>

<p>Use the softest tools you can find. And prepare for a long and slow process, to avoid further scratching.<br>
What you need to use depends on the metal of your knife, but the list starting with the harshest you may need reads:</p>

<ul>
<li>fine grained sharpening stone used with oil.</li>
<li>Copper or silver polish or tooth paste, (possibly with a mechanical buffing method.)  </li>
<li>(green) scourer sponges with oil rather than water.</li>
<li>leather with very fine sand. </li>
<li>the jeans of the trousers you wear. </li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to do all in one go, you can do sessions between using the knife, as long as you are careful washing off all the metal shavings and the oil you used while working. Add a new coating of oil when putting the knife away.
My grandmother used to always wipe the table knives with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumice"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pumice</a>, which while not as fine is as soft as you can get in stone.<br>
If you get into that same habit with this knife, in the longer run the scratches will disappear. (Instead of pumice you can also use the (green) scourer pad.)  </p>

<p>The stone you can use is a natural stone, with a grain so fine you can not see it, so a smaller grain than any sand paper you can buy.</p>

<p>I would put the knife on a protective surface, like a cheap wooden board or some plastic sheeting with a couple of sheets of paper on the top.<br>
Always use liquid while working, either water, spit or oil, and in this case I would go for food quality oil.</p>

<p>Strip heaters heat to about 280F to do angle bends, so essentially any electric indirect infrared source (i.e. no gas, no direct flames or direct contact with hot surfaces) will work in a pinch. The forming temperatures are usually around 270-290F depending on material. </p>

<p><strong>Quick note of caution:</strong> Overheated acrylics can give off dangerous gases when heated above certain temperatures, so appliances used in a kitchen setting are not generally recommended. Outdoor or well-ventilated area only, so if you understand that, then&hellip;</p>

<p>The heating rod from an electric BBQ starter can be used for certain types of angular bends, as long as the material is narrow enough to be heated evenly along its width. </p>

<p>A toaster oven can be used for smaller pieces if you want the entire piece heated. Built-in oven thermostats are notoriously inaccurate, so start at a low temperature (250 F?) and heat it slowly until pliable. Use an external thermometer if you have it and don't over heat it. </p>

<p>If the material is thin and narrow enough, you might even try holding it over a high-wattage light bulb. It wont give you any type of precision for where exactly it will be heated, but depending on your application, that level of precision may not be needed.</p>

<p>Even an electric hair dryer can work in some applications; same caveats as above, but the material has to be thin enough for any of these applications so not to scorch the surface before the interior is heated. Low and slow is the key.</p>

"how to avoid checking mobile during work?","129","","<p>I don't know whether does it happen to others or not, but I check my mobile in each 15-30 minutes interval.

It will <em>not</em> come off until you need it to, and when you are ready to make repairs, you just pull that little glue ""tab"" at the bottom of the hook and the adhesive will come off quickly and cleanly.

","<p>That appears to be some type of semi-transparent vinyl material or something closely related.

The gradual loss of transparency over time is due to bodily oils, light, and particularly sunlight.</p>

<p>That type of damage is not reversible from a practical standpoint.

<p>Another option, if it's all right to get them wet, is to submerge them in water. I believe the ants will most likely float, and you can skim them off the surface of the water.

"Right shoe getting abraded abnormally","93","","<p>Inside of my right shoe, on the part where the back of the heel touches the cloth of the shoe, there is an abnormal abrasion that wears away on the cloth.

<p>Method 3: Place the earphones in the freezer overnight. The plastic will shrink slightly and break the adhesion between the sleeve and the nozzle. The cold temperature will not damage the earphones. <strong>Be careful:</strong> <em>Do not break off the earphone nozzle.</em></p>

<p>Method 4: This method will ruin the flexible sleeve.  Use a staple remover.  Clamp it around the flexible sleeve and gently pull upward. The earphone stem is small enough to fit the gap in the middle of the staple remover jaws.</p>

","<p>I've figured it out! For anyone who's curious, here's <strong>how to sharpen nasal scissors</strong>.</p>

<p>Next, press the sloping edge to the surface you intend to use for sharpening. It may be better to use the corner of the surface. With medium force, press the scissor edge to the surface and pull downwards for about five to ten centimetres.</p>

","<p>Explanation: As the parts of the headband and earphone cushion where the hair touches the equipment is affected, I suspect that something you use in your hair has reacted with the materials used on your headphones.</p>

<p>If the surface is broken or pitted, there is little that can be repaired. You can try some pressure sensitive cloth tape to cover the area. If that is not acceptable, replacement is another alternative.</p>

<p>If the surface has some sticky material that can be removed, try a drop of mild detergent (blue Dawn has no additives and rinses cleanly) or your usual shampoo on a damp cloth to remove it. If that doesn't work, contact the manufacturer for their recommendation for the material they used.</p>

<p>Contact the manufacturer customer relations department for their opinion on how to proceed. Their knowledge base might have similar solutions to similar problems. Identify your hair care materials in the chance they have already had some experience with exactly the problem you identify.</p>

<p>It seems unlikely but possible that you can get a refund or replacement if there is something wrong with your equipment since it is relatively new and you have evidently taken excellent care of it.</p>

<p>Lastly, is there a chance that someone had a problem when they borrowed your headphones without your knowledge or permission.</p>

"How can I better protect my laptop in my backpack?","51","","<p>I recently purchased a new laptop. This one is an investment as I intend to use it for consulting and moonlighting. I take my laptop with me commuting to and from work, as I've got opportunity during the commute to bring it out and do work. Since this laptop is an investment I want to do the best I can to protect it from damage. I put my laptop into my backpack, in the compartment built into the backpack for laptops. However, to be honest with myself, the backpack I've got is just the garden variety that you get at Sam's Club. It's a Swiss Gear backpack I got 4 or 5 years back. Yesterday I took a close look at the compartment for laptops and found that it really isn't well padded. The public buses and trains that I take to commute normally jostle a lot. Clearly the best thing to do would be to purchase a better backpack with proper padding. But, at least at the moment that exceeds my budget. Especially when I look at some of the brands out there where a really good backpack with good padding for laptops is around $200.</p>

<p>So, I'm wondering if there something I can put into my current backpack's laptop compartment which will give it good protection from the bumps I normally experience in my commute? I've thought of maybe using old clothes or a towel, but wonder if that would just leave lint that could go into the air vents of the laptop. What other material might I consider?</p>
","<p>Go to Walmart and go to the camping section. Buy a camping sleep pad made of closed cell foam. They are usually blue. They run about $8. I think the brand is Ozark Trail. The foam is tough, yet absorbs shock well. Much better than something like bubble wrap. The foam is easily cut. So, you can use a couple of layers on the bottom and thinner layers to surround your computers on the sides, if you like.</p>

<p>You will also find a lot of other uses for the padding. I cut a 2' x 2' square for padding for a chair. And, at $8, I have one pad rolled up stored away for future use.</p>

<p>I found a nice computer backpack at T.J.Maxx made by Targus for less than $20. It is brown, kind of ugly, but it is nicely padded and doesn't attract attention like a shiny black or colorful computer backpack. </p>

<p>I would also highly recommend the pads for camping with a sleeping bag or just sleeping on a hard floor as well because the 1/2"" of foam make a huge difference for both insulation and cushioning.</p>
