"How can I reformat my SD card to use it normally again?","553923","","<p>I wish to reformat my SD card to use normally again (it currently has one 78&nbsp;MB <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#FAT32"">FAT32</a> partition and one 3.9&nbsp;GB Linux partition). How do I do this (on Windows/Mac/*nix)?</p>
","<p>You can use <code>DISKPART</code> in Windows, or the equivalent <code>fdisk</code> command under Linux/Mac.</p>

<hr>

<h1><code>DISKPART</code> (Windows)</h1>

<p>Start a command prompt, and start the DISKPART console.  List all of your disks by typing <code>LIST DISK</code>, then select the proper disk with <code>SELECT DISK #</code> (where # is the SD card).  You can then type <code>CLEAN</code> to clear the partition table on the card, effectively blanking it.  <strong>MAKE SURE YOU SELECTED THE PROPER DISK BEFORE RUNNING THE <code>CLEAN</code> COMMAND!</strong></p>

<p>To create a primary partition to reuse the space on the card, type <code>CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY</code>. This will then reallocate the previously ""cleaned"" space.</p>

<p>To format, type <code>FORMAT FS=FAT32 QUICK</code>, and finally, to reassign a drive letter, type <code>ASSIGN</code>.</p>

<p>If you're unable to determine the proper disk, remove the SD card, run <code>DISKPART</code> and <code>LIST DISK</code>, and then re-run it with the SD card inserted.  The SD card is just the disk that has been added.</p>

<p><sub>Note that the above commands are <em>not</em> case sensitive; I used caps to match the convention <code>DISKPART</code> displays.</sub></p>

<hr>

<h1><code>FDISK</code> / <code>CFDISK</code> (Linux/Mac)</h1>

<p>In a terminal, start <code>fdisk /dev/sdx</code> where <code>/dev/sdx</code> is your SD card device (may depend on the Linux distro you're using, see below).  You can then delete all existing partitions on the device by typing d, and then adding a single new partition &amp; format it.  You an also just type n to create a new partition table, and start laying everything out.</p>

<p><code>cfdisk</code> is also another viable tool, which is basically <code>fdisk</code> with a greatly improved user interface.  In both cases, once the drive is formatted, you will lastly need to <code>mount</code> it.</p>

<p>If you're unable to determine the proper device, remove the SD card, run <code>fdisk -l</code>, and then re-run it with the SD card inserted.  The SD card is just the device that has been added.</p>

"How do I backup my Raspberry Pi?","356663","","<p>I have been writing programs for my Raspberry Pi (running Raspbian) for a few weeks now and would like to make sure I protect the work I have done. </p>

<p>How can I backup the files I have created? </p>

<p>Can I simply plug the SD card into my Windows (XP or 7) PC and copy it either to the hard drive or another SD card?</p>
","<p>If you want to preserve all of the data, you will probably have to create a disk image. Furthermore, Windows cannot recognize typical Linux filesystems, so you probably won't even be able to see your files, when you plug in your SD card.</p>

<p>Creating a disk image will preserve not only files but also the filesystem structure and when you decide to flash your new SD card, you will be able to just plug it in and it will work.</p>

<h1>Linux</h1>

<p>On Linux, you can use the standard <code>dd</code> tool:</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/sdx of=/path/to/image bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>/dev/sdx</code> is your SD card. </p>

<h1>Mac</h1>

<p>On Mac, you can also use the standard <code>dd</code> tool with a slightly different syntax:</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/rdiskx of=/path/to/image bs=1m
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>/dev/rdiskx</code> is your SD card. </p>

<p>(using rdisk is preferable as its the raw device - quicker)</p>

<p>To find out which disk your device is type <code>diskutil list</code> at a command prompt - also, you may need to be root; to do this type <code>sudo -s</code> and enter your password when prompted.</p>

<h1>Windows</h1>

<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>

<p>On Windows, you can use the reverse process that you used when flashing the SD card. </p>

<p>You can use <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Win32 Disk Imager</a>, which is the preferred tool for flashing a SD card of the Foundation. Just enter the filename (the location and name of the backup image file to be saved), select the device (the SD card) and press read:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/89CMl.png"" alt=""Win32 Disk Imager""></p>

<p>Of course, you can also use <a href=""http://www.chrysocome.net/rawwrite"" rel=""noreferrer"">RawWrite</a>, <a href=""http://www.chrysocome.net/dd"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>dd</code> for Windows</a> or similar tools, the process is quite similar.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>

<p>If you don't want to back up your entire system, but only specific files, I suggest you connect to your Raspberry Pi via SFTP and copy the files to your local computer (You can use the <a href=""http://winscp.net/eng/index.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">WinScp</a> client). If you have SSH enabled, SFTP usually requires no special configuration on the Raspberry Pi side.</p>

<p>Another option is to <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/5427/can-a-raspberry-pi-be-used-to-create-a-backup-of-itself/"">copy the files to a remote system using rsync</a>.</p>

<p>You can also install special drivers so your Windows can read <code>ext</code> filesystems (and will thus be able to read the whole SD card), such as <a href=""http://www.ext2fsd.com/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ext2fsd</code></a> but it is probably not worth the effort.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since the image will be of the same size as your SD card, you may want to compress it. This can be achieved simply by using your favorite compression tool, such as <code>gzip</code>, 7zip, WinZip, WinRar ...</p>

<p>How do I set up networking/WiFi/static IP address on the Raspberry Pi?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>(This is a Dorothy Dixer to hopefully catch the hundreds of similar questions.)</em></p>
","<p>This tutorial applies to the Foundation releases of <strong>Raspbian Stretch</strong>, <strong>Raspbian Jessie</strong> and the last <strong>Raspbian Wheezy 2015-05-05</strong> (no longer available).</p>

<p>If this is your first attempt and you want just a simple setup jump straight to <strong>How to setup Raspbian Networking</strong> below and skip the technical issues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The release of Stretch requires a few changes.</p>
  
  <p>One change is to <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>, and the default <strong>network interface names</strong> have changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Predictable Network Interface Names</h3>

<p><code>Stretch</code> introduces<sup>1</sup> <a href=""https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/amd64/release-notes/ch-whats-new.en.html#new-interface-names"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">predictable network interface names</a> which have been used in other distributions for some time.</p>

<p>Network interfaces will have names formed from a prefix <code>en</code> — Ethernet or <code>wl</code> — wlan followed by <code>x</code> indicating <code>MAC</code> and the <code>MAC</code> e.g. <code>enxb827eb123456</code> or <code>wlx00c140123456</code>.
The onboard WiFi of the Pi3 and PIZeroW which is connected over <code>sdio</code> will however use the name <code>wlan0</code></p>

<p>This can be beneficial to those using multiple network interfaces, however for most Pi users, with a single Ethernet and WiFi interface will make little difference. The previous names <code>eth0</code> and <code>wlan0</code> can be restored  if you pass <code>net.ifnames=0</code> on the kernel command line in <code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code>.</p>

<p><sup>1. For some incomprehensible reason the Foundation decided to ""Disable predictable network interface names for Ethernet devices"" only 3 weeks after introducing the long-awaited feature. There is an option under <code>Advanced Options</code> of <code>raspi-config</code> to toggle this setting - this requires an updated version of <code>raspi-config</code>.</sup></p>

<hr>

<h1>How to setup Raspbian Networking</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are using an <strong>Ethernet</strong> connection with a router there should be no configuration required and it should work out of the box.</p>
  
  <p>NOTE The Pi3 inbuilt WiFi does not support 5GHz networks, and may not connect to Ch 12,13 on 2.4GHz networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are using <strong>WiFi and the GUI</strong> set up by following the <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/README.md"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Foundation Guidelines</a></p>

<p>If you are using <strong>WiFi from the Command Line</strong> set up by following the <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Foundation Guidelines</a>
This is the only way to set up a network which does not broadcast <code>SSID</code>.</p>

<p>This can also be used to setup a 'Headless' system e.g. using a serial console cable, but it MUCH easier if you can borrow a monitor and keyboard for setup. See below for another possible method using an Ethernet cable to a PC.</p>

<h3>Headless Raspbian WiFi Setup</h3>

<p><a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/another-update-raspbian/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raspbian</a>, since May 2016, checks the contents of the boot directory for a file called <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code>, and will copy the file into <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant</code>, replacing any existing <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> file that may be there. The file in the boot directory is then removed. This can be used to enable headless setup, using the <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> settings detailed below. (You will probably want to enable <code>ssh</code> as well.)</p>

<h2>What is my IP Address?</h2>

<p>If you just want to know the <code>IP Address</code> your Pi is using enter <code>hostname -I</code> on the command line.</p>

<h2>SSH</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of the November 2016 release, Raspbian has the SSH server disabled by default. You will have to <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enable</a> it manually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Enter <code>sudo raspi-config</code> in the terminal, first select <code>advanced options</code>, then navigate to <code>ssh</code>, press <code>Enter</code> and select Enable or disable ssh server.</p>

<p>For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named 'ssh', without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card.</p>

<h1>Networking Files</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are running a recent Raspbian <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> should be as below. <strong>If you have changed it PUT IT BACK.</strong> (Or on <code>Stretch</code> just <strong>delete it</strong> - it effectively does NOTHING.)</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code># interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)

# Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd
# For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'

# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Stretch</strong> includes the <code>10-wpa_supplicant</code> hook, so the links to wpa_supplicant are not needed.  The older settings are incompatible with Predictable Network Interface Names.</p>

<p>The <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> used by <strong>Jessie</strong> should be:-</p>

<pre><code># interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)

# Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd
# For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'

# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

allow-hotplug wlan1
iface wlan1 inet manual
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The file <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code> will be created/modified by the recommended setup methods, but can be setup by hand. Recent Raspbian have an option in <code>raspi-config</code> to enter SSID and Password. It should contain something like the following:-</p>

<pre><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid=""ESSID""
    psk=""Your_wifi_password""
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to connect to a <strong>private network</strong> <em>(i.e. no broadcast <code>SSID</code>)</em> include the line <code>scan_ssid=1</code> inside <code>network={⋯}</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE If you want to connect to different networks (e.g. at work or home) you can include multiple <code>network={⋯}</code> entries.  </p>
  
  <p>If you have access to multiple networks and want to connect to a specific network, include the line <code>priority=100</code> inside the <code>network={⋯}</code> entry.<br>
  You can select a different priority for each network, the highest priority accessible network will be selected; the default is 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>There are many other options which can be used see <code>man wpa_supplicant.conf</code>.</em></p>

<h1>Advanced <code>dhcpcd</code> Configuration</h1>

<p>Raspbian, by default, uses <code>dhcpcd</code> to manage network interfaces. This is automatic, and most users need do no more than specify the SSID and password for wireless networks.</p>

<p>It is possible to configure how <code>dhcpcd</code> works; see <code>man dhcpcd.conf</code>. There is a good article on <code>dhcpcd</code> at <a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dhcpcd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dhcpcd</a></p>

<p>The following describe some of the more common configurations:-</p>

<h2>Setup a Static IP Address</h2>

<p>See separate answer <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/74428/8697"">Static IP Address</a></p>

<h2>Fallback profile</h2>

<p>It is possible to configure a static profile within <code>dhcpcd</code> and fall back to it when DHCP lease fails. This is useful particularly for headless machines, where the static profile can be used as ""recovery"" profile to ensure that it is always possible to connect to the machine. The static profile is setup as any other Static IP Address</p>

<pre><code># define static profile
profile static_eth0
static ip_address=⋯
static routers=⋯
static domain_name_servers=⋯

# fallback to static profile on eth0
interface eth0
fallback static_eth0
</code></pre>

<h2>Prevent <code>dhcpcd</code> from configuring an interface</h2>

<p>This is often done to enable the Pi to act as an <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Access Point</a> (which needs to be configured using other files), while allowing normal <code>DHCP</code> configuration on other interfaces.</p>

<p>Add <code>denyinterfaces wlan0</code> to the end of the file (but above any other added interface lines).</p>

<h2>Use different wpa_supplicant files</h2>

<p>It is possible to configure dhcpcd to use different wpa_supplicant.conf files for a specific wireless interface.</p>

<p>Create a file named <code>wpa_supplicant-""$interface"".conf</code> in <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/</code> e.g. <code>wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf</code> will only be used by <code>wlan0</code></p>

<p><code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code> will be used for any other wireless interfaces.</p>

<h1>Connecting a Computer to the Pi</h1>

<p>Recent versions of Raspbian (which use <code>dhcpcd</code>) allow <code>ssh</code> to work over a <code>link-local</code> address and <code>avahi</code> (which is a zeroconf implementation) enables programs to discover hosts running on a local network.</p>

<p>This means you can plug the Pi into a Computer (with an Ethernet cable) or a local network router and connect without knowing the IP address.</p>

<p>You can easily connect from Linux and OS X with <code>ssh pi@hostname.local</code> (the default hostname is <code>raspberrypi</code>) This should work with popular GUI <code>ssh</code> programs.
This is sometimes problematic with some versions of Windows and networks which use .local in a non-standard way. (See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.local"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.local</a>)</p>

<p>NOTE <code>.local</code> resolution does not always work e.g. in <code>rsync</code>. The following should resolve IP (and can be included in <code>bash</code> scripts)<br>
<code>RemotePi=$(getent hosts hostname.local | awk '{ print $1 }')</code></p>

<p>If your system does not have <code>getent</code> to query the <code>hosts</code> e.g. macOS you can use the following:-<br>
<code>RemotePi=$(arp -n hostname.local | awk '{x = $2; gsub(/[()]/, """", x);  print x }')</code></p>

<p>If you have multiple Pi you need to make sure each Pi has a unique hostname.</p>

<p>You can use a crossover cable, but you don't need one (most modern interfaces automatically detect).</p>

<p>One drawback of direct connection is that the Pi will have no Internet access and the date will not be set. You can copy the date from the host by running <code>ssh pi@hostname.local sudo date -s$(date -Ins)</code> before connection.</p>

<h2>Scope:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This tutorial is about setting up a normal Raspbian installation to access the internet using the included software. It also covers connections to other computers on the same network.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>It is primarily aimed at helping new users struggling to get their Pi (especially WiFi) working .</em> </p>

I have seen a lot of tutorials online for the Raspberry Pi camera but have yet to find on that lets me stream straight from the Raspberry Pi camera like you can with a webcam (using SimpleCV or OpenCV). Was hoping someone could point me in the right direction.</p>
","<p>The solution suggested by Diego is good except that it's pretty slow and has a huge video delay since the vlc there re-streams a stream of the raspvid. Since 12/2013 there is an official v4l2 driver available: <a href=""http://www.ics.com/blog/raspberry-pi-camera-module#.VJFhbyvF-b8"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.ics.com/blog/raspberry-pi-camera-module#.VJFhbyvF-b8</a>

<p>How can I resize the image so that I have more space on my root partition?</p>
","<p>Assuming you  are using Debian. </p>

<h2>The Short Version:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Backup your system</li>
<li>Remove the main and swap partitions (leaving the boot partition alone)</li>
<li>Recreate the main partition to utilize the remaining disk space (excluding the boot partiton). Make sure to reuse the same start sector as the original root partition.</li>
<li>reboot the system </li>
<li>resize the new boot root partition to utilize the full partition size.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Step by Step Instructions</h2>

<p>First make a backup of your SD Card using the instructions found <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/311/how-do-i-backup-my-raspberry-pi"">here</a> in case something goes wrong.</p>

<p>From the command line or a terminal window enter the following</p>

<pre><code>sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

<p>then type <code>p</code> to list the partition table </p>

<p>you should see three partitions. if you look in the last column labeled <strong>System</strong> you should have </p>

<ol>
<li>W95 FAT32</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Linux Swap</li>
</ol>

<p>make a note of the start number for partiton 2, you will need this later. though it will likely still be on the screen (just in case). </p>

<p>next type <strong><code>d</code></strong> to delete a partition.</p>

<p>You will then be prompted for the number of the partition you want to delete. In the case above you want to delete both the Linux and Linux swap partitions.</p>

<p>So type <strong><code>2</code></strong> </p>

<p>then type <strong><code>d</code></strong> again and then type <strong><code>3</code></strong> to delete the swap partition.</p>

<p>Now you can resize the main partition. </p>

<p>type <strong><code>n</code></strong> to create a new partition.</p>

<p>This new partition needs to be a primary partition so type <strong><code>p</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Next enter <strong><code>2</code></strong> when prompted for a partition number.</p>

<p>You will now be prompted for the first sector for the new partition.
<strong>Enter the start number</strong> from the earlier step (the Linux partition)</p>

<p>Next you will be prompted for the last sector you can just <strong>hit enter to accept the default</strong> which will utilize the remaining disk space.</p>

<p>Type <strong><code>w</code></strong> to save the changes you have made.</p>

<p>Next reboot the system with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>once the system has reboot and you are back at the commandline enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2
</code></pre>

<p>Note: this can take a long time (depending on the card size and speed) be patient and let it finish so you do not mess up the file system and have to start from scratch. </p>

<p>Once it is done reboot the system with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>You can now verify that the system is using the full capacity of the SD Card by entering the following command:</p>

<pre><code>df -h
</code></pre>

<h2>Why This Works:</h2>

<p>The real magic here is that <strong>you delete the root and swap partitions, then recreate only the root partition (using the original start sector) before writing the data to the disk</strong>. As a result you don't erase the existing data from the root partition. </p>

<p>By removing the swap partition you allow the root partition room to grow beyond its current size and fill the unused portion of the disk (because of the placement of the partitions -the root partition is sandwiched between the boot and swap partitions - it can't simply be resized leaving the swap partition alone). </p>

<p>You then resize (which is safe to run on  a mounted disk) the file system to  use all the space in the new root partition.</p>

"Why is my audio (sound) output not working?","240620","","<p>I can't get the audio running. I don't hear anything and can not play anything.</p>

<p>Is there a solution to enable audio?</p>
","<h1>Sound does not work with an HDMI monitor</h1>

<p>This is caused by some computer monitors which select DVI mode even if an HDMI cable is connected. This fix may be necessary even if other HDMI devices work perfectly on the same monitor (or TV)! 
Edit the configuration file - see the instructions at <a href=""http://elinux.org/R-Pi_ConfigurationFile"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raspberry-Pi Configuration File</a>.<br>
Add the following line to the configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>hdmi_drive=2
</code></pre>

<h1>Sound does not work at all, or in some applications</h1>

<p>Sound is disabled by default because the ALSA sound driver is still ""alpha"" (not fully tested) on the R-Pi. To try out sound, from the command prompt before ""startx"", type</p>

<pre><code> sudo apt-get install alsa-utils
 sudo modprobe snd_bcm2835
 sudo aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
</code></pre>

<p>By default output will be automatic (hdmi if hdmi supports audio, otherwise analogue). You can force it with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo amixer -c 0 cset numid=3 &lt;n&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>where n is 0=auto, 1=headphones, 2=hdmi. (<a href=""http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Sound_does_not_work_at_all.2C_or_in_some_applications"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)
If you are running Debian, try</p>

<pre><code>cd /opt/vc/src/hello_pi
 make -C libs/ilclient
 make -C libs/vgfont
cd hello_audio
 make
 ./hello_audio.bin
</code></pre>

<p>to test analogue output. And to test HDMI.  </p>

<pre><code>./hello_audio.bin 1
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that you may have to add your user to the 'audio' group to get permission to access the sound card.</p>

<h2>Making the changes permanent</h2>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install alsa-utils</code> is permanent, but <code>sudo modprobe snd_bcm2835</code> only initialises the driver for the current session. To ensure the module is initialised on boot, add <code>snd_bcm2835</code> to <code>/etc/modules</code> (<a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/761/how-do-i-run-a-command-at-boot"">source</a>).</p>

"Can a simple cable convert HDMI output to VGA?","207667","","<p>One may buy a simple HDMI-to-VGA cable, or an HDMI-to-DVI cable.  Example: <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004S5H30I"">on Amazon</a>. However, my vague knowledge is that these cables only work for video cards that have special support for this function. Does the Raspberry Pi support such things?</p>

<p>Is there any easy way to use the Raspberry Pi on a screen that only takes VGA input without a converter box? What kind of conversion to other video outputs would the Raspberry Pi hardware support, and what cables or other equipment would be necessary for this?</p>
","<p>No.</p>

<p>The reason a DVI-to-VGA adapter works on your PC &amp; laptop is that DVI includes analog (RGB) pins.  The adapter is passive; It just connects the red analog output of the PC to the red analog input of the monitor, ditto for green and blue.  They are included on most PCs and laptops for backward compatibility.</p>

<p>HDMI-to-DVI cables are also passive, but they carry <em>digital</em> signals only.  The analog RGB signals are missing, but that does not matter as the DVI monitor does not need them.</p>

<p><strong>HDMI contains no analog signal</strong> so it is not possible for any combination of <em>passive</em> adapters and/or cables to convert it to VGA.</p>

<p><em>Active</em> adapters work because they use DSPs and DACs to convert from one standard to the other, but of course they are more expensive than passive cables.</p>

","<p>VirtualBox lets you run x86 virtual machines on an x86 processor. Raspbian is a distribution for ARM processors. Raspbian cannot run in VirtualBox.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianFAQ#What_is_Raspbian.3F"" rel=""noreferrer"">Raspbian is essentially Debian</a> with binaries compiled to match the Pi's processor more closely than the official Debian binaries.

<p>If so, how would I go about doing it and how many concurrent, distinct PWM outputs can I have?</p>
","<p>As suggested by <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/305/141"">Alex Chamberlain</a>, the <a href=""https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/"" rel=""noreferrer"">WiringPi</a> library appears to support both hardware PWM output on one GPIO pin and <a href=""https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/software-pwm-library/"" rel=""noreferrer"">software PWM</a> on any of the other GPIO pins. Meanwhile the <a href=""http://pythonhosted.org/RPIO/pwm_py.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">RPIO.PWM library</a> does PWM by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access"" rel=""noreferrer"">DMA</a> on any GPIO pin. Effectively this is a halfway house between hardware and software PWM, providing a 1&nbsp;µs timing resolution compared to 100&nbsp;µs with WiringPi's Software PWM<sup>[1]</sup>. </p>

<p>Which of these is suitable for your applications depends on how many PWM outputs you need and what performance you want out of those outputs.</p>

<p>If your application is tolerant of low-timing resolution and high <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter"" rel=""noreferrer"">jitter</a> then you could use a software or DMA assisted timing loop. If you want higher precision / lower jitter PWM then you may need hardware assistance.</p>

<h3>When might software PWM be suitable?</h3>

<p>If you want to flash a bunch of LEDs with different human visible cadences (10's of hertz) with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing#Criteria_for_real-time_computing"" rel=""noreferrer"">soft real-time</a> response requirements then the software loop could handle as many PWM's as you have GPIO pins.</p>

<h3>When might hardware PWM be suitable?</h3>

<p>If you want to control a servo motor with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing#Criteria_for_real-time_computing"" rel=""noreferrer"">hard real-time</a> response requirements then you will need to use hardware PWM. Even then you may have problems ensuring a real-time response for the servo loop which ties encoder input to PWM output.</p>

<p>A stable <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory#Classical_control_theory"" rel=""noreferrer"">servo loop</a> need to read encoders at a regular rate (low jitter), write out revised PWM output values at a regular rate and the latency between these should be fixed (low jitter overall) or you will have to undertune your motor to prevent it becoming unstable under load. This is hard to do with a multi-tasking operating system without low-level support.</p>

<h3>What if I need multiple hardware PWM outputs?</h3>

<p>If you need to run multiple servo loops, then you are probably going to need to offload them to another device to ensure hard real-time performance, relegating your Raspberry Pi to being a soft real-time <em>supervisor</em>.</p>

<p>One option, would be something like the <a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/products/815"" rel=""noreferrer"">Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver - I²C interface - PCA9685</a> which would allow you to control 16 PWM outputs with just a few pins of GPIO for the I²C bus.

"How do I update software and firmware?","177866","","<p>I understand that the software on the Raspberry Pi is divided into three sections: the closed-source GPU firmware, the patched ARM Linux kernel and the user space software.</p>

<p>Is the GPU firmware on the chip or SD card?
Is there an easy way to update everything (firmware, kernel, modules)?</p>
","<h2>What is the GPU firmware and kernel?</h2>

<p>The kernel is responsible for managing the resources of the Raspberry Pi and runs on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"" rel=""noreferrer"">central processing unit</a> (CPU). It allows tasks to run on the CPU. The GPU firmware, on the other hand, manages the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"" rel=""noreferrer"">graphical processing unit</a> (GPU). The two separate units are on the same chip and share memory, which is segregated at boot time according to hard-coded <code>start.elf</code> files. In order to use the Raspberry Pi, both sets of files must be in the correct locations on the SD card.</p>

<p>You can buy preloaded SD cards from the retail partners of the Foundation.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the Foundation regularly release new SD cards images at <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads</a>. You must use Unix's <code>dd</code> or Windows' <code>Win32DiskImager</code> to load this on an existing SD card.</p>

<p>It's not possible to compile your own GPU firmware image, because it is closed source, so we rely on the Foundation and Broadcom to supply this. On the other hand, you can compile your own kernel image from source. Cross-compilation is the subject of other questions, such as <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/192/how-do-i-cross-compile-the-kernel-on-a-ubuntu-host"">How do I cross-compile the kernel on a Ubuntu host?</a></p>

<h2>Updating the GPU firmware - Debian/Raspbian</h2>

<p>You can update the firmware using <code>rpi-update</code> by Hexxeh. On <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Software"" rel=""noreferrer"">Raspbian</a>, you can install it by running</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install rpi-update
</code></pre>

<p>To update the software, run</p>

<pre><code>sudo rpi-update
</code></pre>

<h2>Updating userspace and kernel Software - Debian/Raspbian</h2>

<p>The userspace software must be maintained. It's pretty easy; just run</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>If there are any errors, you can try updating the database first by running</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't understand an error, then it's probably best you ask here or try googling.</p>

<h2>Updating software - Arch Linux</h2>

<p>The software must be maintained. The advantage of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux"" rel=""noreferrer"">Arch Linux</a> over Debian here is that Arch Linux manages the Raspberry Pi's firmware within the package management system. To update, just run</p>

"Installing Raspbian from NOOBS without display","147120","","<p>I am trying to install Raspbian from NOOBS, but I have no other screen/keyboard available than my laptop screen/keyboard. I find enough information about using a laptop screen/keyboard for a Pi, but then you already need to have an OS installed. But I have no OS installed, because my SD card contains NOOBS and I want to install Raspbian using NOOBS.</p>

<p>How can I do that with only my laptop screen and keyboard? I'm running Windows 7 on my laptop.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>This no longer works since <code>ssh</code> is not enabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using only the laptop's screen and keyboard (both before and
after installation), install and configuration for headless
operation using SSH is possible using NOOBS (they call it
""silent install""). It does <strong><em>not</em></strong> require a <strong><em>separate screen</em></strong>
or keyboard/mouse. It does require an SD card reader on the
laptop (built in or external USB), though.</p>

<p>The only thing required on the Raspberry Pi side is an
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ethernet</a> connection (to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"" rel=""noreferrer"">SSH</a> into it from a host
system). Alternatively, using special hardware
(USB-to-serial adapter), it possible to use
some <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#General_Purpose_Input.2FOutput_.28GPIO.29"" rel=""noreferrer"">GPIO</a> pins on the Raspberry Pi.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

<p>This can be done deleting a few folders, editing two files
on the SD card and setting some symbolic links in
<code>/etc/init.d</code> (make a backup copy first of the SD card content
if you only have the SD card with NOOBS on it). The security
conscious may want to change the default password before installation.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A host computer capable of running an SSH client and of
reading/writing the file system on the Raspberry Pi's SD
card (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4"" rel=""noreferrer"">ext4</a>). The operating system could be Windows, Mac
or Linux. This could be a computer that is normally
running Windows, but which has a DVD drive so <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ubuntu</a> can
be started in trial mode using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD"" rel=""noreferrer"">LiveCD</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>An Ethernet connection to the Raspberry Pi and accessible
by the host computer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite"" rel=""noreferrer"">TCP/IP</a>-wise (the host computer could
itself use Ethernet or a wireless connection).</p></li>
<li><p>A text editor on the host system that can correctly
handle <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix"" rel=""noreferrer"">Unix</a> end-of-line characters. For example,
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UltraEdit"" rel=""noreferrer"">UltraEdit</a> on Windows that I have used for testing.
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B"" rel=""noreferrer"">Notepad++</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vim</a> on Windows should
also be fine.</p></li>
<li><p>An SD card reader (to make crucial changes to the SD card
during the process, both pre-install og post-install).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>HowTo</h2>

<h3>Pre-install</h3>

<p>For instance, to automatically install <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Software"" rel=""noreferrer"">Raspbian</a> (the
recommended choice) when power is applied to the Raspberry
Pi with the SD card in, do the following offline (on the host system,
Windows, Mac or Linux):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/noobs"" rel=""noreferrer"">Download and prepare NOOBS</a> (<a href=""http://director.downloads.raspberrypi.org/NOOBS/images/NOOBS-2014-09-12/NOOBS_v1_3_10.zip"" rel=""noreferrer"">NOOBS 1.3.10</a>,
 released 2014-09-09, is a 704&nbsp;MB download)
 on a sufficiently large SD card, 4 GB or greater.</p>

<p>This can involve using <a href=""https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/"" rel=""noreferrer"">SDFormatter</a> with option
 ""FORMAT SIZE ADJUSTMENT"" set to ""ON""
 to format the entire SD card as one big FAT32 formatted
 partition). See the linked page for details.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <code>os</code> folder on the SD card with NOOBS, delete all
 folders except <code>Raspbian</code> (folders <code>Arch</code>, <code>RaspBMC</code>, <code>Pidora</code>,
 <code>OpenELEC</code>, <code>RISC_OS</code>, and <code>data_partition</code> for NOOBS 1.3.7.
 And only <code>Data_Partition</code> for NOOBS 1.3.10).</p></li>
<li><p>Edit file <code>\os\Raspbian\flavours.json</code>, so it only
 contains the desired version of Raspbian, ""Raspbian""
 (not ""Raspbian - Boot to Scratch"").</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<pre><code>   {
     ""flavours"": [
       {
         ""name"": ""Raspbian - Boot to Scratch"",
         ""description"": ""A version of Raspbian that boots straight into Scratch""
       },
       {
         ""name"": ""Raspbian"",
         ""description"": ""A Debian wheezy port, optimised for the Raspberry Pi""
       }
     ]
   }
</code></pre>

<p>After:</p>

<pre><code>   {
     ""flavours"": [
       {
         ""name"": ""Raspbian"",
         ""description"": ""A Debian wheezy port, optimised for the Raspberry Pi""
       }
     ]
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Delete the extra file(s) that your text editor may produce (such as a .bak file).</p></li>
<li><p>Edit file <code>recovery.cmdline</code> (in SD card <code>root</code> folder) to append <code>silentinstall</code> to the arguments list.</p>

<p>Before (may differ depending on NOOBS version):</p>

<pre><code> runinstaller quiet vt.cur_default=1 coherent_pool=6M elevator=deadline
</code></pre>

<p>After (may differ depending on NOOBS version):</p>

<pre><code> runinstaller quiet vt.cur_default=1 coherent_pool=6M elevator=deadline silentinstall
</code></pre>

<p>Delete the extra file(s) that your text editor may produce (such as a .bak file).</p></li>
<li><p>Optional:</p>

<p>To hold the option open of connecting a TV to the
   video output, also add <code>display=3</code> (3 for PAL, 4 for NTSC):</p>

<pre><code> runinstaller quiet vt.cur_default=1 coherent_pool=6M elevator=deadline silentinstall display=3
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Optional: change the default user name and password by editing <code>\os\Raspbian\os.json</code>:</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<pre><code>   {
     ""name"": ""Raspbian"",
     ""url"": ""http://www.raspbian.org/"",
     ""version"": ""wheezy"",
     ""release_date"": ""2014-01-07"",
     ""kernel"": ""3.10"",
     ""description"": ""A community-created port of Debian wheezy, optimised for the Raspberry Pi"",
     ""username"": ""pi"",
     ""password"": ""raspberry""
   }
</code></pre>

<p>After:</p>

<pre><code>   {
     ""name"": ""Raspbian"",
     ""url"": ""http://www.raspbian.org/"",
     ""version"": ""wheezy"",
     ""release_date"": ""2014-01-07"",
     ""kernel"": ""3.10"",
     ""description"": ""A community-created port of Debian wheezy, optimised for the Raspberry Pi"",
     ""username"": ""pi"",
     ""password"": ""DerSkalMangeFlereJobsTilI2014tOverHeleVerden11111111111111111111df11111111111111111111""
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Delete the extra file(s) that your text editor may produce (such as a .bak file).</p></li>
<li><p>Put the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect it with an
 Ethernet cable such that the host system with the SSH client
 can see it and such that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol"" rel=""noreferrer"">DHCP</a> is available to the
 Raspberry Pi (for instance, most <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"" rel=""noreferrer"">NAT</a>-routers have a DHCP server
 built in). Perhaps disconnect the system from the
 Internet until the password has been changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Power the Raspberry Pi on to start the installation.
 And wait! This can take a while, like half an hour or more.
 To be sure, leave it alone for a few hours. An install time
 of 19 minutes and 20 seconds has been measured when
 using NOOBS 1.3.10 (from power up till the first
 successful ping). The current drawn was 400 - 480&nbsp;mA
 and fell to 370&nbsp;mA after the first ping succeeded.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Post-install</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Find the Raspberry Pi's IP&nbsp;address (assigned by DHCP)
 somehow. For instance, guess it from the IP&nbsp;address range
 that a DHCP server in a NAT router uses and ping those addresses
 (mine is set up to use
 192.168.0.100 - 192.168.0.255 and often it is
 assigned 192.168.0.100 or 192.168.0.101).</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wireshark</a> can also be used for this purpose, especially if it
 is in an environment with a lot of devices. This is much easier to do
 if the MAC address of the Raspberry Pi is known, and it can be
 obtained by temporary using step 4 below.</p>

<p>This step is not necessary if a fixed IP address is set in step 4 below.</p></li>
<li><p>Ping from the host to test if there is a connection.</p></li>
<li><p>SSH is <strong><em>not</em></strong> enabled by default for Raspbian in NOOBS version 1.3.7 - despite what some pages claim. (It may be different for Arch Linux.) However, it <strong><em>is</em></strong> for Raspbian in NOOBS version 1.3.10, and this step may no longer be necessary (however, any purchased Raspberry Pi may be delivered with an SD card with an older version of NOOBS, and it may be worth saving the 700&nbsp;MB download).</p>

<p>The easiest way to enable it is described in <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/38/prepare-for-ssh-without-a-screen/1706#1706"">Oli's
 answer to <em>Prepare for ssh without a screen</em></a>
 (on this site) and is to change the symbolic links
 in <code>/etc/init.d</code> (in <code>root</code>).</p>

<p>For instance, booting from the Ubuntu 13.04 LiveCD with
 a USB card reader on the host system and issuing these
 commands in <em><a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal"" rel=""noreferrer"">Terminal</a></em> will be sufficient:</p>

<pre><code> sudo su
 cd /media/ubuntu/root
 for i in 2 3 4 5; do sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/ssh etc/rc$i.d/S02ssh; done
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Optional: set a fixed IP address if this makes it
easier and the kind of network allows it. On a home
network this could be by assigning an IP address outside
of the IP address range used by a NAT router's DHCP server,
for example, 192.168.0.93.</p>

<p>In file <code>cmdline.txt</code> (in folder <code>boot</code> off the root of the SD card) add this at the end of the long line:</p>

<pre><code>ip=192.168.0.93
</code></pre>

<p>The end result may be something like:</p>

<pre><code>dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p6 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait ip=192.168.0.93
</code></pre>

<p>Like for step 3, the file to edit would be <code>/media/ubuntu/root/boot/cmdline.txt</code>.</p>

<p>Note: without extra parameters after the IP address there is no connection to the Internet and thus step 11 below will fail.</p></li>
<li><p>If the LiveCD method has been used for step 3 and 4: Shutdown
Ubuntu (to write out the changes and unmount the SD
card).</p></li>
<li><p>Start the Raspberry Pi up with the SD card inserted.</p></li>
<li><p>SSH to the Raspberry Pi using the IP address found in step 1 or step 4 (for instance, using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY"" rel=""noreferrer"">PuTTY</a> on Windows) and log in:</p>

<pre><code>login as: pi
pi@192.168.0.100's password: raspberry    (or the password that was set in os.json, see 6 in *Pre-install*.)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Change to a new password:</p>

<pre><code>    su pi
    passwd
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Optional: do further configuration of the Raspberry Pi</p>

<pre><code>    sudo raspi-config
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Optional: enable TV output</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Open <code>config.txt</code> in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi"" rel=""noreferrer"">vi</a>:</p>

<pre><code>  sudo vi /boot/config.txt
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Outcomment this line (NOOBS may have inserted an
extra line with this enabled), so it reads (insert <code>#</code>
at the beginning of the line):</p>

<pre><code>  #hdmi_force_hotplug=1
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Uncomment this line (<code>2</code> is for PAL; use <code>0</code> for NTSC),
so it reads (remove the <code>#</code> at the beginning of the line):</p>

<pre><code>  sdtv_mode=2
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>:wq</code></p></li>
<li><p>Restart to see the effect:</p>

<pre><code>  sudo shutdown -r now
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Even Raspbian delivered with NOOBS 1.3.10 has the very serious <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shellshock</a> vulnerability that is in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bash</a>, and you do not want the Raspberry Pi to be left unpatched.</p>

<p>To test whether the Raspberry Pi is vulnerable to Shellshock, issue:</p>

<pre><code>env x='() { :;}; echo ""WARNING: SHELLSHOCK DETECTED""' bash --norc -c ':' 2&gt;/dev/null;
</code></pre>

<p>To refresh the repositories and upgrade Bash, issue:</p>

<pre><code>sudo su
apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install --only-upgrade bash
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>When testing this, I used:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>NOOBS 1.3.7 and NOOBS 1.3.10.</p></li>
<li><p>UltraEdit on Windows as it handles text files with Unix
line endings without any problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows XP 64-bit (yes, I know)</p></li>

"How to setup multiple WiFi networks?","146042","","<p>I go back and forth from home to school with my Pi.

I've noticed lots seem to use <code>wpa_supplicant</code> but I not sure why...</p>

<p>Anyway, I know how to make the WiFi IP static for my home network but how do I set things up for auto-connecting to my school WiFi and use a different static IP for that network?</p>

  <p>Lite is a minimal version of the Raspbian image for the

  which results in the operating system using a lot less of

  <p>This answer is still correct, and explains in more detail the nature of the changes, but most users of current Raspbian should just run <code>sudo raspi-config</code> Select <code>Interfacing Options / Serial</code> then specify if you want a <strong>Serial console</strong> (probably no) then if you want the <strong>Serial Port hardware enabled</strong> (probably yes). Then use <code>/dev/serial0</code> in any code which accesses the Serial Port.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The BCM2837 on the Raspberry Pi3 has 2 UARTs (as did its predecessors), however to support the Bluetooth functionality the fully featured PL011 UART was moved from the header pins to the Bluetooth chip and the mini UART made available on header pins 8 &amp; 10.</p>

<p>This has a number of consequences for users of the serial interface.</p>

<p>The <code>/dev/ttyAMA0</code> previously used to access the UART now connects to Bluetooth.<br>
The miniUART is now available on <code>/dev/ttyS0</code>.<br>
In the latest operating system software there is a <code>/dev/serial0</code> which selects the appropriate device so you can replace <code>/dev/ttyAMA0</code> with <code>/dev/serial0</code> and use the same software on the Pi3 and earlier models.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are a number of other consequences:-</p>

<pre><code>The mini UART is a secondary low throughput UART  
  intended to be used as a console.
The mini Uart has the following features:
• 7 or 8 bit operation.
• 1 start and 1 stop bit.
• No parities.
• Break generation.
• 8 symbols deep FIFOs for receive and transmit.
• SW controlled RTS, SW readable CTS.
• Auto flow control with programmable FIFO level.
• 16550 like registers.
• Baudrate derived from system clock.
</code></pre>

<p>There is no support for parity and the throughput is limited, but the latter should not affect most uses.</p>

<p>There is one killer feature ""Baudrate derived from system clock"" which makes the miniUART useless as the this clock can change dynamically e.g. if the system goes into reduced power or in low power mode.</p>

<p>Modifying the <code>/boot/config.txt</code> removes this dependency by adding the following line at the end:-</p>

<pre><code>core_freq=250
</code></pre>

<p>This fixes the problem and appears to have little impact. The <code>SPI clock frequency</code> and <code>ARM Timer</code> are also dependent on the system clock.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some bizarre reason the default for Pi3 using the latest 4.4.9 kernel is to DISABLE UART. To enable it you need to change 
  <code>enable_uart=1</code> in <code>/boot/config.txt</code>. (This also fixes the <code>core_freq</code> so this is no longer necessary.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally if you don't use Bluetooth (or have undemanding uses) it is possible to swap the ports back in Device Tree. There is a <code>pi3-miniuart-bt</code> and <code>pi3-disable-bt</code> module which are described in <code>/boot/overlays/README</code>. </p>

"Where does the Raspberry Pi get the time from?","129449","","<p>I don't have to set the clock (besides the timezone) on the Raspberry Pi.  Where is it getting the time from?  About how accurate is it?</p>
","<p>Raspbian gets the time from an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol"">NTP Server</a> (a ""time server"").</p>

<p>Unplug your Raspberry Pi completely, pull out the network cable and start the Raspberry Pi up again. You will see that the date and time are incorrect.</p>

<p>If you want/need the date and time to not be reset without being plugged into the internet, you'll need a Real Time Clock (RTC) - for example, something like <a href=""http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/raspberry-pi-real-time-clock"">this</a> - which will keep the time current, by using a battery to run a clock. This is, also, how your computer keeps the time when it is not being powered.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
Just a side note that the above RTC clock is not the only way to keep the time accurate between power losses. You could also use a GPS module and hook that up to the GPIO pins.</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy</strong>
It's pretty accurate, although if your clock's time is off by quite a bit. It may take up to 3 hours to correct itself, as changes from the server are applied gradually to your local clock. Network stability has the biggest impact on the accuracy, as a unpredictable network (something more wireless, like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"">3G</a>) will make it very hard to be accurate. To put it simply: The accuracy is pretty good, the time difference between your computer and the actual time (from the NTP Server) is normally <a href=""http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo.htm#Q-ACCURATE-CLOCK"">less than 100ms</a>.</p>

"How can I extend the life of my SD card?","129396","","<p>I'm not all that keen to buy a USB hard disk, but I'm aware that SD cards aren't suitable for many repetitions of reading and writing.</p>

<p>Are there any steps I can take to extend the life of my SD card while it's being used by my Raspberry Pi?</p>
","<p>These methods should increase the lifespan of the SD card by minimising the number of read/writes in various ways:</p>

<h2>Disable Swap</h2>

<p>Swapping is the process of using part of the SD card as volatile memory. This will increase the amount of RAM available, but it will result in a high number of read/writes. It is unlikely to increase performance significantly.</p>

<p>Disable swap with the <code>swapoff</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo swapoff --all
</code></pre>

<p>You must also prevent it from coming back after a reboot:</p>

<ul>
<li>For Raspbian which uses <a href=""http://neil.franklin.ch/Projects/dphys-swapfile/"" rel=""noreferrer"">dphys-swapfile</a> to manage a swap file (instead of a ""normal"" swap partition) you can simply <code>sudo apt-get remove dphys-swapfile</code> to remove it permanently. Best to remove because setting the <code>CONF_SWAPSIZE</code> to 0, as explained in <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/1605/4387"">this answer</a>, doesn't seem to work and still creates a 100MB swap file after reboot.</li>
<li>For other distributions that use a swap partition instead of a swap file, remove the appropriate line from <code>/etc/fstab</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Disabling Journaling on the Filesystem</h2>

<p>Using a journaling filesystem such as <code>ext3</code> or <code>ext4</code> WITHOUT a journal is an option to decrease read/writes. The obvious drawback of using a filesystem with journaling disabled is data loss as a result of an ungraceful dismount (i.e. post power failure, kernel lockup, etc.). </p>

<p>You can disable journaling on <code>ext3</code> by mounting it as <code>ext2</code>.</p>

<p>You can disable journaling on <code>ext4</code> on an unmounted drive like this:</p>

<pre><code>tune4fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sdaX
e4fsck –f /dev/sdaX
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<h2>The noatime Mount Flag</h2>

<p>Assign the noatime mount flag to partitions residing on the SD card by adding it to the options section of the partition in <code>/etc/fstab</code>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reading accesses to the file system will no longer result in an update to the atime information associated with the file. The importance of the noatime setting is that it eliminates the need by the system to make writes to the file system for files which are simply being read. Since writes can be somewhat expensive as mentioned in previous section, this can result in measurable performance gains. Note that the write time information to a file will continue to be updated anytime the file is written to with this option enabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Directories in RAM</h2>

<p>Highly used directories such as <code>/var/tmp/</code> and possibly <code>/var/log</code> can be relocated to RAM in <code>/etc/fstab</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>tmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs nodev,nosuid,size=50M 0 0
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow <code>/var/tmp</code> to use 50MB of RAM as disk space. The only issue with doing this is that any drives mounted in RAM will not persist past a reboot. Thus if you mount <code>/var/log</code> and your system encounters an error that causes it to reboot, you will not be able to find out why.</p>

<h2>Directories in external Hard Disk</h2>

<p>You can also mount some directories on a persistent USB hard disk. More details of this can be found in <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/489/40"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi can also boot it's root partition from an external drive. This could be via USB or Ethernet and means that the SD card will only be used to delegate to different device during boot. This requires a bit of kernel hacking to accomplish, as I don't think the default kernel supports USB storage. You can find more information at <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/757/40"">this question</a>, or this <a href=""http://mitchtech.net/raspberry-pi-root-fs-on-usb-drive/"" rel=""noreferrer"">external blog post</a>. </p>

"How can one control AC power (220V) with a Raspberry Pi?","119857","","<p>I though about using the Raspberry Pi to switch on and off other electrical devices which unnecessary consume power in stand-by mode. In short, I'd like to control an AC socket or multiple sockets. How can one let the computer ""push the button"":</p>

<p>Image: <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Socket_5.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">CC-BY-SA 3.0 by Firstfreddy</a></p>

<p>The physical solution is a relay, but I don't want to build all on my own and play around with 220V and sparks when switching on and off ;-) By the way the Raspberry Pi requires 2 Watt in idle mode, so only using it as a switch to save energy might not make sense, so it should be usable for other purpose at the same time.</p>
","<p>Well you could use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_relay"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Solid State Relay</a> which is much smaller and easier to control than a mechanical relay, using an MCU or in this case Pi's GPIO pin.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWNH2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You have to drive the input pin constantly to keep the relay on (just like a mechanical relay). So if something fails with that signal, then the power goes off. To avoid that you have to design another circuit that can sustain itself.</p>

<p>But you can get these pretty cheap on eBay and they are completely safe (isolated), so they won't blow up the Pi and do not require a lot of power to drive them, about 3~10mA. Just check the details before buying one. It is also worth noting they can heat up if you load them heavily (close to the maximum rating) </p>

"What is the optimum split of main versus GPU memory?","116831","","<p>I read that it's possible to allocate either 128MB, 64MB or 32MB to the Raspberry Pi's video memory. </p>

<p>Given that my primary use case for this machine is educational: I will be running lightweight python scripts and web-browsing. Is it likely to suffer any loss of features by switching to only 32MB of memory for me? </p>

<p>I do not anticipate wanting to use any 3D or playing any video. </p>
","<p>I would expect you to not experience a noticeable difference unless you are doing graphically heavy tasks, such as playing video. </p>

<p>However, it's difficult to gauge the optimal settings, as performance limits will vary depending on what applications are executing and user expectations. </p>

<p><em>The best thing you can do is experiment.</em></p>

<p>If you do want to change the split, then there are two different methods, depending on the firmware you have. If possible then <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/164/40"">make sure you have the latest firmware</a>. If it is not possible for you to update for whatever reason, then I have included both options below:</p>

<h1>New Firmware (after October 2012)</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Edit <code>/boot/config.txt</code> and add or edit the following line:</p>

<pre><code>gpu_mem=16
</code></pre></li>
<li>The value can be <code>16</code>, <code>64</code>, <code>128</code> or <code>256</code> and represents the amount of RAM available to the GPU.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Old Firmware (before October 2012)</h1>

<p>In order to alter the video memory you need to replace the <code>start.elf</code> file on the <code>/boot/</code> partition of the image. The possible <code>.elf</code> files should be in the <code>/boot/</code> directory on your Pi. You make the switch by replacing the <code>start.elf</code> file with one of the others.</p>

<p>There are three memory models, and here are the recommendations taken from <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=4691&amp;sid=bd0f69c5d08447a3871925e9dd001e7f"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Raspberry Pi discussion board</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>224MB RAM and 32MB VRAM for a Linux desktop distro, or a heavy (non

   </li>
  <li>192MB RAM and 64MB VRAM (default) for desktop distro's that want to

   </li>
  <li>128MB RAM and 128MB VRAM for applications and games that do extensive

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I am a complete n00b when it comes to Linux, C, and the Raspberry Pi. So, the three have come together in a perfect storm to attack!</p>

<p>I have created a C file called <code>main.c</code> in a folder. The directory is:</p>

","<p>Compiling C programs on the raspberry pi is rather simple. First, create your program in a text editor and save it as <code>&lt;insert name&gt;.c</code> It should be saved on the Desktop.</p>

<p>This is where the interesting stuff occurs. <code>GCC</code> is the compiler - it makes your code executable. <code>-Wall</code> activates compiler warnings - this is <em>extremely</em> helpful for debugging. The next line <code>&lt;myName&gt;.c</code> tells the computer where the code is stored. <code>-o</code> is an option - it tell <code>GCC</code> to compile.

X-Windows does not seem to be responding to the <code>.xinitrc</code> file. I tried editing this file on the default user (<code>pi</code>) and also <code>root</code>. Nothing seems to make a difference to the screen saver.</p>

<p>Has anybody managed to stop screen-blanking on Raspbian? Is there a UI option or even a configuration file which will allow me to permanently change the screensaver time out?</p>

","<p>I prefer to disable most of the network auto configuration and connection management daemon stuff and deal with it myself.  Here's a (bash) script that will keep the connection up as long as the network is there and you do not have a glitchy wifi driver or power issues; the idea is to ping the router every N seconds, and if that fails, re-connect:</p>

<pre class=""lang-bsh prettyprint-override""><code>#!/bin/bash

        fi
done

. /etc/wifi.conf

exec 1&gt; /dev/null
exec 2&gt;&gt; $log
echo $(date) &gt; $log
# without check_interval set, we risk a 0 sleep = busy loop
if [ ! ""$check_interval"" ]; then
        echo ""No check interval set!"" &gt;&gt; $log
        exit 1
fi

startWifi () {
        dhclient -v -r

        dhclient -v $wlan
}

ifconfig $eth down
ifconfig $wlan up

while [ 1 ]; do

<p>So, <code>/etc/wifi.conf</code> in this case might contain:</p>

<pre><code>router_ip=192.168.0.1
log=/var/log/wifi.log
wlan=wlan0
eth=eth0
essid=someNetwork
check_interval=5
</code></pre>

<p>This all presumes an open unencrypted network (if otherwise, you will have to add the appropriate commands).  I've used this approach on various linux machines, including the pi, and it works flawlessly; it will keep a system online indefinitely, even if it periodically goes to sleep (which the pi cannot anyway).</p>

<p>A decent check interval is 3-5 seconds; this activity will not significantly impact system resources at all.</p>

<p><strong>You absolutely do need to disable the network auto-configuration first</strong>, .   including <code>ifplugd</code> and other networking daemons, or this will interfere with your efforts:</p>

<p><a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/37594/5538"">How can I disable autoconfigured networking on Raspbian?</a></p>

<p>I in fact used <code>apt-get remove ifplugd</code>.</p>

<pre><code>wifi_mod=`lsmod | grep 8192cu`
if [ ""$wifi_mod"" ]; then
        echo ""Starting wifi...""
        /usr/bin/nice -n -10 /usr/local/bin/wifi &amp;
else
        echo ""Starting ethernet...""
        /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up
        /sbin/dhclient eth0
fi
</code></pre>

<p><code>/usr/local/bin/wifi</code> is the script.  If you don't know what <code>nice</code> is for, read <code>man nice</code>.</p>

<p>The point of the <code>if</code> is that if my wifi dongle is plugged into the pi, the 8192cu module will be loaded by the kernel at this point -- so wifi should start.  If not, then it's assumed that the ethernet is plugged in and should be used (if it is isn't, dhclient will just crap out and there is no network access).  </p>

<p>For this to work you will probably have to</p>

<p>So, this gets a headless pi onto the network at boot and keeps it there.  If you wanted a way to switch to eth while running without logging in, you could do something with <strong>udev rules</strong> for pulling the wifi dongle out.</p>

<p>I know the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting <code>max_usb_current=1</code> sets the available current over USB to 1.2A (default is 600mA)</li>
<li>This can help if you have a decent power supply (2A, at least) and need to power something like a small external HDD or something that needs 300+ mA.</li>
<li>This feature is only available on the B+ and Pi model 2 (at the time of this writing)</li>
</ul>

<p>But some of the people mentioning the setting warn against setting this value unless you absolutely <em>need</em> to... my question is, why is that? Is something else disabled or changed about the Pi that would increase a risk of damaging the Pi or anything powered over USB, or is it more a general warning to scare off people who don't know what they're doing and might not have a decent power supply to the Pi?</p>
","<p>It seems that the only concern is that your power supply, if it's not a decent, reliable supply capable of 2A+ of clean output power, might not be able to power the Pi sufficiently, resulting in crashes or frequent rainbows.</p>

<p>See, specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All that max_usb_current=1 does is to set GPIO38 high, which in turn turns on a FET, which connects a second 39K resistor in parallel to an existing one, on pin 5 of U13, the AP2553W6 USB power manager, lifting the current limit from 0.6A to double that (1.2A), see no possible scenario there why the PI resets because of that, except in case the gate of the FET Q4 is somehow shorted to GND. Which could be caused by a production fault. Inspect Q4, as look if there is solder shorting pins together. Also R6 (resistor mounted between gate of Q4 and GND) should be 100K not 0 Ohm.

<p>I've read that 2.5A are now needed but I've read contradictory infos on the subject: that 2.5A is only if you plan to run power-hungry USB devices.</p>

<p>So how much more power does this draw and is it a concern at all?</p>
","<p>There's a short piece that includes Pi 3 benchmarks over at the <a href=""http://blog.pimoroni.com/raspberry-pi-3/"">PiMoroni blog</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All of the benchmarks below were carried out with just a USB keyboard
  and mouse connected with power supplied from the official Raspberry Pi
  Power Supply, with the exception of the WiFi dongle test in which the
  USB WiFi dongle was also connected. The Pis were naked, i.e. not in a
  Pibow, except for the onboard WiFi in Pibow test.</p>
  
  <p>... </p>
  
  <p>The benchmark we used here was Sysbench, computing primes up to
  20,000. This is a heavily CPU bound test and, as such, ideal for
  comparing the [Pi Zero, Pi 2 and Pi 3] SoCs without side-effects from the memory or GPU.</p>
  
  <p>... </p>
  
  <p>Current was measured with an inline USB current and voltage meter.
  <strong>The built-in Wireless LAN and Bluetooth and the more powerful
  processor mean that the Raspberry Pi 3 draws about twice the current
  of its predecessor when under heavy CPU load (750mA vs 360mA).</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can’t get extra performance without a few sacrifices. The Pi 3

<li>This is how you can chain the multipliers to RAID, RAID'ed RAID's. You can go 4 multipliers deep and choose from a few raid options. At the Start of the Chain where the blue arrow is your combined terabytes of storage, redundant in the way you configured it to be. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4DZv5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>This is the standard usage, where you can plug 5 hard drives and RAID them in a certain way, then connect that as a physical drive in 1 SATA port or USB  SATA Interface.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVtQE.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You just have to connect the Blue arrow to a SATA to USB converter. As long as you run at USB 2 speeds throughout, you can make quite a mean beefy NAS drive using a Pi.</p>

<p>To power the unit there is a standard plug (good old 1.44"" Floppy Drive Connector) It is used in all PC's power supplies for accessories now a days. In this picture is a MOLEX converter. It is the smaller connector. The voltages are:</p>

<ul>
<li>YELLOW - 12V </li>
<li>RED - 5V</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to check how many amps it needs. But if you going to power 5X3.5"" Hard drives then a 250Watt power supply will be the best option for powering everything, even the Raspberry from the 5V line!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6umRZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Good luck :)</p>

<p><strong>-EDIT-</strong></p>

<p>Specifically useful for Raspberry Pi 2+ and a nice alternative to untrustworthy RAID systems.</p>

<p>Instead of using the RAID function on these boards, configure each drive in JBOD and use ZFS to create volumes. ZFS is very stable and guarantees you won't lose a 'bit' of data before it tells the system it's done. Most RAID controllers, like these possibly, usually tell the system the data is written, then flushes data to the drive, which may become corrupt during flush and then absolutely tells nobody, 'dirty' little secrets.. ZFS, firsts writes, verifies and then says everything is OK. Plus, you can always move your drives into a FreeNAS setup and import the volumes easily as if nothing has happened. </p>

<p>Remember though, the bandwidth is limited to USB2 speeds. </p>

<p>A great speed, and fairly well balanced setup is 4 HDD's setup as 2x2 mirrored. It gives you half the capacity with 1 to 2 redundancy. ie 4 x 1TB gives you 2TB total, but wait...
ZFS talks to each drive separately, write speeds of 1 drive (~50mb/s) ... read speed of 2 drives (~100mb)!!!! </p>

<p>A blazing fast combination would be mirror 1 X 4. ie 4 x 1TB gives you 1TB BUT, read speeds of up to 200mb/s!!! Write speeds of 1 drive still.</p>

"How to set up swap space?","93579","","<p>Raspberry Pi has only 256 MB of RAM, so I would like to use swap space (either on SD card or attached USB storage). How do I set it up?</p>
","<p>Raspbian uses <a href=""http://neil.franklin.ch/Projects/dphys-swapfile/"">dphys-swapfile</a>, which is a swap-file based solution instead of the ""standard"" swap-partition based solution. It is much easier to change the size of the swap.</p>

<p>The configuration file is:</p>

<p>The content is very simple. By default my Raspbian has 100MB of swap:</p>

<hr>

<p>In reality, it is more complicated than this. </p>

<p>I've taken two screenshots from the Device B schematic (released <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1090"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>):</p>

<p><strong>Power in (fig A):</strong><br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aNNaW.png"" alt=""USB Power in""></p>

<p>We can see that the 5 volt line (+5V0) is powered directly from the USB input power, through a 1.1A, 6V Polyfuse (miniSMD). I believe this means that the 5V input is current limited to 1.1A (maximum hold current, not peak).</p>

<p>Let's assume that you're powering the device from a regulated 5V supply capable of supplying at least 700mA.</p>

<p><strong>USB Power out (fig B):</strong><br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jR134.png"" alt=""USB power out""></p>

<p>As we can see from fig B, the USB ports are current-limited by polyfuses (miniSMDC014) to 140mA (constant draw). </p>

<p>Some users have discovered that their polyfuses at 100mA have approx 5 Ohm resistance, causing a voltage drop of V = iR = 0.1*5 = 0.5 V. This isn't ideal, as this means the output USB voltage would be 5 - 0.5 = 4.5 V. (This may cause some devices to not function if they expect 5.0 V)</p>

<p>As the current draw on the USB increases (ie to 150mA), voltage drops further - 0.15*5 = 0.75 V, resulting in an output voltage of 5 - 0.75 = 4.25 V, which is below the USB spec minimum voltage of 4.40V (<a href=""http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb2.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">source</a>). This is assuming the resistance doesn't increase with current draw, although in reality the resistance/current draw plot will look something like this:<br>

<p>From a Q/A with Pete Lomas:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fuses kick in hard around 280mA and fold back and limit to 140mA.
  If you remove them then all you have for protection is the 700mA
  inbound fuse. The tracking on the board is good for 500mA+ so you
  could if you really wanted to. What about a powered hub – to power
  the Pi and bigger USB devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>To power higher power devices: (i.e. USB 2 devices)</strong></p>

<p>You should use a powered USB hub, that can supply >= 0.5A per USB port. This means if your USB hub has 4 ports, it should use at least a 2A power supply. </p>

<p><strong>Other options:</strong></p>

<p>If you don't want to use a USB hub with a second power supply, you can do one of the following options:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These methods are not recommended, and may damage your board/devices. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Create/buy a split USB cable that uses a separate 5V source (such as your input source). </p>

</pre></li>
<li><p>Join the output of the two polyfuses (solder a jumper across). As the polyfuse current is being split, this will allow up to ~200mA for one USB device, or 50/150 across two. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gXSeA.jpg"" alt=""Soldering jumper across polyfuses""></p>

","<p>There are some great answers here, but many are out of date. Since May 2016, Raspbian has been able to copy wifi details from <code>/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf</code> into <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code> to automatically configure wireless network access:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a wpa_supplicant.conf file is placed into the /boot/ directory, this will be moved to the /etc/wpa_supplicant/ directory the next time the system is booted, overwriting the network settings; this allows a Wifi configuration to be preloaded onto a card from a Windows or other machine that can only see the boot partition.</p>

<p>Since the <code>/boot</code> partition is accessible by any computer with an SD card reader, wifi configuration is now much simpler.</p>

<p>A typical wpa_supplicant.conf file is:</p>

<pre><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev

<blockquote>
  <p>For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named 'ssh', without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card. When the Pi boots, it looks for the 'ssh' file; if it is found, SSH is enabled and then the file is deleted.

<ul>
<li>4 USB ports – for the first time, you’ll be able to have a keyboard, mouse and wifi dongle plugged in without needing a powered hub. Bear in mind, you will probably need a more powerful power supply for the B+ if you want to use all 4 ports. They’re recommending a 2A supply. Of course, if you’re just using a mouse and a keyboard then a 1A supply will probably be absolutely fine.</li>
<li>Better USB hot plug capability – you should be able to plug in your wifi dongles in without reboots!</li>
<li>A new Ethernet port with activity lights.</li>
<li>The USB and Ethernet ports are now all in a straight line, rather than in the B’s staggered arrangement.</li>
<li>The yellow composite video port has gone and there is now a combined 3.5mm jack that provides audio and the analogue video signal.</li>
<li>The HDMI port, the CSI (camera) and DSI (display) ports have all moved slightly.</li>
<li>The micro USB power socket has changed sides. This means that all the ports are on the same side of the Pi – so cable management is much better with the B+.</li>
<li>The B+ sports a 40-pin GPIO header (compared to the B’s 26) and no longer has a P5 and P3 header. All the GPIO is on that one header now. The 26 pins to the left (nearest the corner) are backwards compatible so all your add-on boards will work (with the exception of any audio boards like the Wolfson which requires the P5 header which is, of course, not on the B+).</li>
<li>4 mounting holes, conveniently located on the corners of the board rather than the 2 oddly-placed holes on the B.</li>
<li>On the back, the B+ uses a micro SD card (as opposed to the B’s full size SD card) with a push-push action (i.e. you push it in and it locks in place, you push it again and it clicks out). The card still protrudes slightly (presumably to make it easy to remove) but the (metal) slot is a vast improvement on the flimsy plastic of the B.</li>
<li>Much clearer silk screen labelling in general.</li>
<li>Lower power requirements – it will use between 0.5 watts and 1 watt less than the model B.</li>
<li>Much better audio output thanks to a dedicated power supply.</li>
<li>Rounded corners! (Still doesn’t fit in an Altoids tin but who cares! The aesthetic change is welcome)</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of doing new things with it, obviously you've got more GPIO pins, so if you want more inputs or outputs then the B+ is for you. Plus it's much easier to plug USB things in to (less need for a powered hub). If you're doing robotics with a portable power supply, the B+ will last longer on it thanks to the lower power consumption.</p>

"Do I still need rpi-update if I am using the latest version of Raspbian?","86068","","<p>I have a 512MB Pi.  I am trying to make sure I am getting the most out of it.  I just downloaded the latest version of <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"">Raspbian</a> and installed it on the Pi.  Do I also need <a href=""https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update"">rpi-update</a>?  Is  rpi-update meant for upgrading from one version of Raspbian to the next?</p>
","<p>I think you might be conflating two different operations.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>rpi-update</code> is a <a href=""https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update"">tool to upgrade the firmware</a> for your Raspberry Pi. Firmware is a small package of code that usually lives on a special chip of a computer that helps the software know how to talk to the hardware. However, in the case of the Raspberry Pi, the firmware will live on the first partition of the SD card.</p></li>
<li><p>Raspbian is an operating system or the <a href=""http://www.raspbian.org/"">core software for your Raspberry Pi</a>. Software (including the OS) lives on second partition of the SD card and is all the stuff that gets executed when you use your device.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these need updating independently. For convenience, the <code>rpi-update</code> tool is included in the Raspbian distribution of Linux because it is a useful software tool that manages the firmware of your Pi's. You should run it periodically to make sure your devices have the latest firmware. Separately, you need to keep your software up to date using the standard Debian software management tools like <code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</code>.</p>

<p>Each of these functions is separate, and updating one will not update the other. Upgrading your distribution to the latest software packages might get you a new version of <code>rpi-update</code>, but unless you RUN <code>rpi-update</code> your firmware will not get updated.</p>

<p>Since the place the firmware is stored is actually flashed to the first partition of the SD card (sort of like a BIOS), you will not need to run this on every device. Once you load a new version of software or firmware onto an SD card, any device you plug that card into will be running that version.</p>

"How much energy does the raspberry pi consume in a day?","82326","","<p>My searching efforts have failed when trying to find this.  On average, how much energy does the raspberry pi consume in 24 hours <strong>( minimal usage vs max usage in a day AND usb vs micro usb powered)</strong>? </p>
","<p>My research began with the original thread on the Raspi forums: <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=6050&amp;p=291334&amp;hilit=watts+power#p291334"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=6050&amp;p=291334&amp;hilit=watts+power#p291334</a></p>

<p>To summarize what we've learned there, the total consumption of a Raspberry Pi is probably not more than:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4 W * 24 h = 96 Wh  (I guess that's 346 kJ) (note this is an energy value, not a power)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and almost certainly more than 10% of that if you can get the power down to 0.4 W.  </p>

<p>Compared to a PC, even a tiny PC like Intel's Compute Stick, these are very small amounts of energy. On the other hand, compared to a dedicated low-power platform like a microcontroller board based on an ARM Cortex-M0, the Pi consumes power like a drunken sailor and, note, has no real sleep modes. It has no real shutdown mode either, for that matter.  [0]</p>

<p>The high usage figure is reasonable for a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, or an original Raspberry Pi model B. The model A+ and Pi Zero consume the least power. </p>

<p>Even at relatively high electricity prices you are looking at &lt; $0.02 per day of running the box. </p>

<p>Note, power consumption has been changing (for the better) with improvements in the software, because it's possible for the OS to power down some blocks of the machine when they are idle or perhaps if explicitly turned off. </p>

<p>Updated following the release of the model B+, A+, Pi 2 Model B, and Pi Zero. 
According to measurements by the awesome <strong>Alex Eames</strong> [1][2][3][4][5]</p>

<pre><code>B  with keyboard                              = 1.89 W -&gt; daily 45   Wh [6]
B+ with keyboard                              = 1.21 W -&gt; daily 29   Wh  
B+ with LAN/USB chip off (no i/o except GPIO) = 0.76 W -&gt; daily 18.2 Wh  
B+ shut down                                  = 0.26 W -&gt; daily 6.2  Wh  
A  idle                                       = 0.7  W -&gt; daily 17   Wh 
A+ idle                                       = 0.52 W -&gt; daily 12.5 Wh 
Pi2 B at idle                                 = 1.15 W -&gt; daily 28   Wh
Pi Zero at idle                               = 0.51 W -&gt; daily 12.2 Wh
Pi3 B at idle                                 = 1.15 W -&gt; daily 28   Wh
Pi3 B at 100% * 4 CPUs                        = 3.6  W -&gt; daily 86   Wh
</code></pre>

<p>The Zero, A+ and B+ really offer huge improvements in the power circuitry. Wow! </p>

<p>Note that the Pi 2 Model B is a 4-core machine with each core idling near 0 and maxing near 0.25 W power demand. </p>

<p>Also please realize that although it's very little power, if you are buying a solar panel, battery, charge regulator, etc. just to run the pi, you are spending a <em>lot</em> more on power hardware than you are spending on computing. </p>

<li><p>You can save as much as 200 mA of current by shutting off USB/LAN i/o    for sleep/processing and then re-enabling it. See <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8498/disable-lan9512"">Disable LAN9512</a> [7] </p></li>

"Using the Raspberry Pi as a router?","80328","","<p>Has anyone used their Raspberry Pi as a routing device?</p>

<p>Mainly I want to use it to monitor my network, and it would be great if it had an input and output for Ethernet, but it doesn't, so I am wondering if it is very effective to monitor the network by having the Ethernet input and then using a USB dongle as a Wi-Fi router. Has anyone done anything like this? Does it slow the Internet down by much?</p>
","<p>I've been using my model B as a router with traffic shaping, using just the one Ethernet port it comes with. Here's a quick-and-dirty on how:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://www.ducea.com/2006/08/01/how-to-enable-ip-forwarding-in-linux/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Enable IPv4 Forwarding</a>, so your Pi acts as a router by forwarding any traffic it receives</li>
<li><p>Configure your Pi with static network configuration so it will not be influenced by DHCP changes suggested below. Here are the contents of my <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> as reference:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code># pi@flux:/home/pi/projects/adsl/rrdlogger (master *)
# cat /etc/network/interfaces 
auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
#iface eth0 inet dhcp
iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.1.1
        netemask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.1.254    # IP of my ADSL router box

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp
</code></pre>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now change your network's DHCP settings such that the default gateway/router is your Pi. This likely means changing the settings on your existing ADSL router box. In my example above, my Pi's IP address is <code>192.168.1.1</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When your devices next reconnect to the network, they will be told your Pi is their gateway to the internet, and all they internet-bound traffic will be sent to it. Your Pi will in turn relay all that traffic to your usual router. You might need to disconnect and then reconnect your devices for these changes to take effect.</p>

<p>Now you can create or install a tool to do your monitoring for you, such as <a href=""http://humdi.net/vnstat/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vnstat</a>.</p>

<h2>Traffic Shaping</h2>

<p>As for traffic shaping, here's another quick-and-dirty guide which will make use of my own personal variant of <a href=""http://lartc.org/wondershaper/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wondershaper</a>.</p>

<p>For this to be useful you need to know how fast your internet connection is. You can usually find this from your (original) router's web interface, but failing that you can get an estimate using a <a href=""http://www.speedtest.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">speedtest</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>sudo apt-get install iptables</code></li>
<li><code>wget https://raw.github.com/meermanr/adsl/master/wondershaper/wondershaper</code></li>
<li><p><code>sudo ./wondershaper eth0</code> will print the current status of traffic shaping. Obviously the expected status is there is no shaping, which means there's a single rule in effect, called <code>pfifo_fast</code>: </p>

<ul>
<li>(<code>eth0</code> is the name of the wired network adaptor on a model B. See <code>ifconfig</code> for the names of interfaces on your system)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<pre><code># pi@flux:/home/pi/projects/adsl/wondershaper (master *)

<p>Your outbound network traffic is now being shaped by your Pi, and your inbound traffic is being throttled slightly to ensure that the Pi, and not your original routing box, has control of traffic.</p>

<p>To disable shaping, just run <code>sudo ./wondershaper eth0 clear</code>. You can change the uplink and downlink rates without clearing first, but it doesn't hurt.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> You also need to disable the transmission of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol#Redirect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ICMP redirects</a>, since we need all traffic to go through the Pi for shaping to happen. It turns out that the Linux kernel is smart enough to figure out that the clients on your home network could talk directly to the ADSL box, rather than bounce traffic through the Pi, and it tells them this at every opportunity. The clients then send their traffic directly to your ADSL box, and the Pi doesn't get a chance to shape it. Disable it on the fly like so (lost when you next reboot):</p>

<pre><code>echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/send_redirects
</code></pre>

<p>Update the following to set this during boot: <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code></p>

<pre><code>net/ipv4/conf/eth0/send_redirects = 0

iface default inet dhcp
</code></pre>

<p>Kind Regards, and thank you very much!</p>
","<p>As suggested by the community, my answer extracted from the question.</p>

<p>I got it working right now so I'll share all my configuration files with the community. Firstly lets look at the wpa_supplicant.conf file:</p>

<pre><code>pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo cat /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf 
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid=""****""
    scan_ssid=1
    proto=RSN
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    pairwise=CCMP TKIP
    group=CCMP TKIP
    psk=""****""
    id_str=""home""
    priority=5
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next my new update interfaces file</p>

<pre><code>pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo cat /etc/network/interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.101
netmask 255.255.255.0

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
address 192.168.0.157
netmask 255.255.255.0
broadcast 192.168.0.255
gateway 192.168.0.1

iface default inet dhcp
</code></pre>

<p>And now comes the tricky part, you have to disable the hotplugging of the eth0 device (else it will disable your wlan0). You do this by edting the following file:</p>

<pre><code>pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo cat /etc/default/ifplugd 
INTERFACES=""eth0""
HOTPLUG_INTERFACES=""eth0""
ARGS=""-q -f -u0 -d10 -w -I""
SUSPEND_ACTION=""stop""
</code></pre>

<p>I also have the following in my startup script, this will make sure my wifi does get started up (sometimes for no reason at all it would not start). You also have to kill the ifplugd daemon on the eth0 device:</p>

<pre><code>pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo cat /etc/rc.local
#!/bin/sh -e

# Print the IP address
_IP=$(hostname -I) || true
if [ ""$_IP"" ]; then
  printf ""My IP address is %s\n"" ""$_IP""
fi

# Disable the ifplugd eth0
sudo ifplugd eth0 --kill
sudo ifup wlan0

exit 0
</code></pre>

<p>And that should work! </p>

<p>I'm running Raspbian ""wheezy"". I've already disabled ""Start desktop on boot"" using <code>raspi-config</code> as described <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/1320/4387"">here</a>. But I keep getting lots of package updates for all the desktop stuff that I don't use (I run <a href=""http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/491"" rel=""noreferrer"">apticron</a> to notify me of pending updates via email), so I'd like to completely <code>apt-get remove</code> all the unnecessary packages to avoid these unnecessary updates.</p>

<p><strong>Which package(s) should I remove?</strong></p>

<p>So far, I've come up with the following:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get remove desktop-base lightdm lxappearance lxde-common lxde-icon-theme lxinput lxpanel lxpolkit lxrandr lxsession-edit lxshortcut lxtask lxterminal obconf openbox raspberrypi-artwork xarchiver xinit xserver-xorg xserver-xorg-video-fbdev</code></p>

<p>I made the above list by looking in aptitude for all packages in the Installed Packages -> x11 -> main section that were not ""automatic installs"".</p>

<p>For some reason when I run this, <code>apt-get</code> tells me that:</p>

<pre><code>The following extra packages will be installed:
  libutempter0 xbitmaps xterm
</code></pre>

<p>which seems a little odd for a <strong>remove</strong> operation.</p>

<p>Is there an easier way? Is there a ""super"" package which owns all of this graphical stuff and can be removed, taking all it's dependencies with it? From my understanding, it doesn't look like this is possible, because these things have not been automatically installed, meaning I need to track them all down and remove them all explicitly.</p>
","<h2>TL;DR or ""Just scorch my pi""</h2>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove --purge 'libx11-.*'
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge
</code></pre>

<p>(Repeat <code>apt-get autoremove --purge</code> until no orphans remain)</p>

<h2>Further explanation</h2>

<p>If a package <strong>foo</strong> <em>depends</em> on another package <strong>libfoo</strong> and you remove the <strong>libfoo</strong> package, the dependent (<strong>foo</strong>) is also removed. Because Foo has a <em>depends</em> line specifying <em>libfoo</em>, it would be broken to leave foo if libfoo were removed. The reverse is not true: removing <strong>foo</strong> <em>does not</em> delete <strong>libfoo</strong> automatically. Another package <strong>xfoo</strong> may <em>also</em> depend upon libfoo, so apt won't just remove it (although apt will track if it was installed <em>only</em> as a side-effect of installing <em>foo</em> and offer to auto-remove it if you ask it to, so long as no others still depend on it)</p>

<p>Meta packages <em>depend</em> on a set of other packages in much the same way that <strong>foo</strong> depended on <strong>libfoo</strong>, so when you remove a meta-package, little else is typically removed. For example, there may be two meta-packages that <em>depend</em> on xterm (lxsession and xfsession perhaps), but uninstalling one or both <em>won't</em> uninstall xterm because xterm isn't broken without lxsession or xfsession. Meta-packages are generally at the <em>top</em> of the dependency tree, not at the bottom, and few things tend to depend directly on meta-packages. Meta-packages primarily provide a convenient way to install a sensible set of packages at once, but they aren't uninstall tools.</p>

<p>So, if you want to scorch <em>everything</em> that depends upon X11, you will need to target the base set of libx11 libraries that all x11 apps <em>must</em> ultimately depend upon:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove --dry-run --auto-remove --purge 'libx11-.*'
sudo apt-get autoremove --dry-run --purge
</code></pre>

<p>This will (simulate) remove everything that ultimately depends on libx11-.*, <strong>and will also remove any packages that were installed as a dependency of an X11 program even if they didn't directly depend on X11 itself</strong> (CUPS and Ghostscript are typically installed as a side-effect of installing a desktop environment). The second command will remove subsequent orphans until none remain. Remove ""--auto-remove"" if you want to do this step later or not do it at all, or just add back the packages manually after cleaning the GUI off.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remove the <strong>--dry-run</strong> option to <em>actually perform</em> the operation <em>after</em> you have checked that it won't remove packages you did not intend to be removed.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I prefer to clean and purge the side-effects, and add them back as needed. Also, I went ahead and tested this on my own pi, and it rebooted to a very spartan but functional server. :)</p>

<h2>Why does a remove <em>install</em> something?</h2>

<p>The above strategy solves the stated problem, but there is still the curiosity of why a <em>remove</em> operation results in packages being <em>installed</em>.</p>

<p>At the heart of every package manager is a <em>satisfiability solver</em> of some kind. When you tell a package manager to <em>install</em> some packages, <em>remove</em> some packages, or <em>upgrade</em> some packages, what you are really asking it to do is to solve for the next desired state of software installation given an available set of packages. This solution <em>may</em> include installing additional packages (dependencies), removing existing packages (conflicts, breaks), downgrading/upgrading specific packages (compatibility level), or a combination thereof. So, while it is a bit counterintuitive that the solver determines that some packages need to be <em>installed</em> in order for other packages to be <em>removed</em>, it makes perfect sense. <em>This</em> is the nasty dependency management problem that package managers solve.</p>

<p>A concrete example: Given a set of Java applications already installed, they all depend upon a java compatible runtime which currently happens to be <strong>openjdk-7-jre</strong>. You then ask the package manager to solve for installation of a new Java tool that declares a <em>conflict</em> with <strong>openjdk-7-jre</strong> but <em>works</em> with <strong>oracle-7-jre</strong> (both packages generically <em>provide</em> a <strong>java-7-runtime</strong>). The solver will propose a <em>removal</em> of <strong>openjdk-7-jre</strong> and an <em>install</em> of <strong>oracle-java-7-jre</strong> as the solution to your desired state of having the new package installed while not breaking existing packages.</p>

<p>In this <em>specific</em> case, <strong>xterm</strong> is a package that <em>provides</em> a virtual dependency called <em>x-terminal-emulator</em> (<strong>xterm</strong>, <strong>lxterminal</strong>, and <strong>aterm</strong> all <em>provide</em> an <em>x-terminal-emulator</em>), so it is likely that in removing <strong>lxterminal</strong> (as a part of removing lxde), the solver found an existing installed package (<em>transcode</em> as a possible example) that required <em>some</em> kind of <em>x-terminal-emulator</em>, so the solver chose to install xterm (which requires <strong>libutempter0</strong> and <strong>xbitmaps</strong>, explaining the other packages to install) to satisfy the otherwise broken dependency. Without seeing the package database, I would hypothesize that this is the most likely scenario.</p>

<p>To discover the packages that are currently depending upon <strong>xterm</strong> (or an alternate), use the <em>apt-cache rdepends</em> command (using the <em>--installed</em> switch to limit to installed packages only):</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-cache --installed rdepends xterm
xterm
Reverse Depends:
    |xorg
     clusterssh
    |xinit
    |tk8.5
    |tk8.4
    |transcode
</code></pre>

<p>Dependencies that start with the alternation character '|' mean that the package depends on <strong>xterm</strong> or something it provides (that something is <em>x-terminal-emulator</em> in this case). The <strong>clusterssh</strong> package depends on <strong>xterm</strong> <em>explicitly</em>, and does not allow for an alternative. This is the short list of the packages that are causing xterm to be required.</p>

<h2>What about deborphan?</h2>

<p>The functionality of tracking orphans was incorporated into apt-get via the 'autoremove' functionality in 2010 (Debian bug <a href=""https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=582791"" rel=""noreferrer"">582791</a>) rendering deborphan <em>mostly</em> redundant and <em>essentially</em> obsolete. Unlike deborphan and other solutions like it, apt-get <em>directly</em> tracks which packages were <em>explicitly</em> installed and which packages were installed as a side-effect or dependency of an explicitly installed package. For example, if an administrator installs foo, libfoo is installed as a <em>side-effect</em> and apt-get autoremove <em>will</em>, in fact, remove libfoo if autoremove (or --auto-remove) is specified when removing foo.</p>

<p>The approach taken by deborphan is a collection of guesses. For example, the guess that an installed library that does not have a dependent must be an orphan: If <strong>libfoo</strong> is installed, but neither <strong>foo</strong> nor <strong>xfoo</strong> are, deborphan may decide it must be an orphan. One failure mode here is that libraries might be specifically installed for the tools they provide (libxml2 for xmllint before it was repackaged into libxml2-utils) or simply available for development purposes. Such packages <em>are not</em> orphans. Additionally, deborphan focuses on libraries, so it misses a number of <em>non-library</em> orphans that apt tracks <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/286947/obsolete-packages-vs-orphaned-packages"">(Obsolete packages vs. orphaned packages)</a>.</p>

"How do I install an OS image onto an SD card?","72174","","<p>I have just ordered my Raspberry Pi, and I want to prepare my SD card. How do I install an OS image onto an SD card?</p>
","<p>The process is pretty simple.</p>

<h1>Download the image</h1>

<p>First, go to the Raspberry Pi Foundation's <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"">Download page</a> and download the image you want. </p>

<p>I suggest the Debian Squeeze image if you are an absolute beginner, but watch out for the Raspbian image soon as it should run faster. The Arch Linux image is great if you want a minimal install or if you've had a bit of experience with Linux before.</p>

<h1>Verify the Download</h1>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundaton provide the SHA-1 hash of the download, which we can use to verify the file was downloaded correctly and wasn't tampered with on the way.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>You can use a utility provided by Microsoft called <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841290/en-us"">fciv</a> or another provided by Frozen Logic called <a href=""http://www.frozenlogic.org/summerproperties.shtml"">Summer Properties</a>.</p>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>sha1sum debian6-19-04-2012.zip</code>. The generated hash should match the one given on the website; at the time of writing, it was 1852df83a11ee7083ca0e5f3fb41f93ecc59b1c8.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Extract the img file</h1>

<p>Extract the <code>.img</code> file and remember where you put it.</p>

<p>I will assume your <code>img</code> file is called <code>debian6-19-04-2012.img</code>, and in the case of a Linux host, your PWD is the directory in which it is stored.</p>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<p>You can use <code>unzip</code> from the command line.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>The installation differs depending on whether you are using a Linux or a Windows host to flash the image onto the card.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<ol>
<li>Insert your SD card into your computer and note down the drive letter it is assigned.</li>
<li>Download and install the <a href=""https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer"">Win32DiskImager</a>.</li>
<li>Select the image file you extracted earlier and the drive letter of the SD card.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Warning</em> There is a significant risk you could damage your file system if you select the wrong drive letter. Make sure you get it right!</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Click ""Write"" and watch the pretty progress bar.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<ol>
<li>Insert your SD card into your computer.</li>
<li>Locate the device, by running <code>sudo fdisk -l</code>. It will probably be the only disk about the right size. Note down the device name; let us suppose it is <code>/dev/sdx</code>. If you are in any doubt, remove the card, run <code>sudo fdisk -l</code> again and note down what disks are there. Insert the SD card again, run <code>sudo fdisk -l</code> and it is the new disk.</li>
<li>Unmount the partitions by running <code>sudo umount /dev/sdx*</code>. It may give an error saying the disk isn't mounted - that's fine.</li>
<li><p>Copy the contents of the image file onto the SD card by running</p>

<p><code>sudo dd bs=1M if=debian6-19-04-2012.img of=/dev/sdx</code></p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Warning</em> There is a significant risk of damage to your filesystem if you use the wrong <code>/dev/sdx</code>. Make sure you get it right!</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Have fun!</h1>

<p>Once you have installed the OS eject the SD card properly and insert it into the Raspberry Pi. Attach power and enjoy.</p>

","<p>Please note there is a clear distinction between errors, based on the numbers at the end and I won't go into much details as they can be easily discovered online if required. These fixes assume that you have all the needed connections working (power, SD card, HDMI, <strong>wired</strong> keyboard, mouse) and are using Raspbian along with NOOBS. </p>

<p>The details for error ending with <strong>2</strong> is at the end of the answer. If your error message ends with <strong>6</strong>, like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kernel panic-not syncing:  VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(179,<strong>6</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you will need to do a filesystem check &amp; repair:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start the Raspberry holding the <code>Shift</code> key.</li>
<li>Once NOOBS loads, press <code>Alt-F2</code> to access the recovery command line.</li>
<li>Login with username <code>root</code> and password <code>raspberry</code>.</li>
<li>Type <code>sudo fsck.ext4 -y /dev/mmcblk0p6</code>. This will scan and attempt to repair the corrupted file system (replace ext4 with your partition type if needed). Note that the <code>auto</code> mode of <code>fsck</code> (i.e. only typing <code>fsck</code> instead of <code>fsck.ext4</code>) is not supported.</li>
<li>Type <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code> to shutdown the Raspberry cleanly.</li>
<li>Unplug the power cable and plug it back in. The Raspberry should now start fine.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>If your error message ends with <strong>2</strong>, like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kernel panic-not syncing:  VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(179,<strong>2</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it is likely that the problem is caused by an update bug. The fix involves switching that <strong>2</strong> into a <strong>6</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start the Raspberry holding the <code>Shift</code> key.</li>
<li>Click the <code>Edit config (e)</code> button or press <code>e</code>.</li>
<li>Click the <code>cmdline.txt</code> tab or press the <code>right arrow</code> on the keyboard.</li>
<li>Replace:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>root=/dev/mmcblk0p<strong>2</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>with</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>root=/dev/mmcblk0p<strong>6</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>Click <code>OK</code> and then press <code>escape</code> on the keyboard to proceed with the boot sequence.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your Pi should now boot fine. If the same error shows but with <strong>6</strong> proceed with the above steps.</p>

<hr>

<p>In some cases, the Pi might ignore the change made in the NOOBS GUI and you would still see the exact same error, with <code>2</code> at the end when booting. In this case, <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=66134"" rel=""noreferrer"">tktbjp's answer</a> might help:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Actually it is simple to use the recovery mode. I entered recovery
  mode and pressed alt-F2 to loging as root. Changing cmdline.txt from
  the GUI does not work.</p>
  
  <p>After logging in as root with password raspberry, check if there is
  any /boot directory. Most probably it will not be present. If not then
  create it using mkdir /boot Then use vi editor to create cmdline.txt. </p>
  
  <p><code>#cd /boot</code></p>
  
  <p><code>#vi cmdline.txt</code></p>
  
  <p>in vi editor change the root to mmcblk0p6. My cmdline.txt contents

<p>My problem is that I've found inconsistent reviews regarding the performance. Some sources say, the board isn't powerful enough to render the GUI, which results in lagging, while others say, they play HD videos without any issues.</p>

<p>Although the price of the device is pretty low, I don't want to buy it simply to find out it isn't powerful enough for my needs.</p>

<p>It would be ok for me if</p>

<li>I have to wait some time until playback starts</li>
<li>If it doesn't play all videos (I could re-encode)</li>
</ul>

<p>It would not ok</p>

<ul>
<li>If videos are lagging</li>
</ul>

<p>Is the Raspberry Pi sufficient for this requirements or should I have a look for more powerful hardware? Please keep in mind that I am not a consumer and I am perfectly fine to play around with the device.</p>
","<p>First of all, remember that software for RaspberryPi is in early state of development and there are a lot of problems with it. They are worked on all the time but still, it's not yet as polished as it could be. Currently RaspberryPi is more oriented to developers than to normal users. It was never designed to be media center it just happens to be <em>possible</em> to use it like that. 
So a lot of people are running raspberrypi as media center with success. However here are a couple of glitches you may encounter:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The CPU of RaspberryPi is quite low-end and it can't really decode video at decent speed (even SD MPEG2). Hardware acceleration has to be used but by default only H264 can be hardware accelerated. You can buy a licence key to enable additional hardware decoders from RPi foundation (currently you can buy MPEG2 and VC-1 license). Graphics chip on RaspberryPi is VERY powerful and if video is encoded with a format supported by the hardware decoder, it can easily play HD content 1080p. But you will have to transcode all your material that is in different formats. And hardware decoding only works with dedicated video player (omxplayer). It is used by RaspBMC so if you plan on using this solution, you should have no problem. If you are planning on running your own distribution, you have to integrate omxplayer. Also bear in mind that omxplayer is quite young project and while it's quite stable, it's not perfect (like most things on RPi dedicated software). Normal graphical environment (X server) does not use accelerated graphics. This is why you found some informations about slow GUI rendering. AFAIK XBMC is using OpenGL ES which does use hardware acceleration so it's not a problem if you plan on using it. </p></li>
<li><p>There are some problems with sound as it's drivers are not good quality 
right now. You may hear some glitches in audio. </p></li>
<li><p>There are also problems with USB on Rpi, this wont let you use USB card to make audio problems go away. And since network chip is also connected using USB, there may be some glitches. Most of them are addressed right now in new versions of software but there may be some more. </p></li>
<li><p>Because of the way USB on RaspberryPi was designed and because of the drivers issues, there may be problems with some USB keyboards or other remote contollers. You may need to use good active hub to connect USB devices. Especially if you are planning on using Wifi.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the issues mentioned above will be invalid after some time as it will probably be fixed. But this may take some time to get there.</p>

<p>To sum up - you asked if it's powerful enough. I believe it's not a good question because it's not really power issue here. Hardware is powerful enough (if you can transcode everything to h264) but software is not mature enough and has some glitches. It may not be simple enough to get it working without problem and this is what you are looking for.</p>

<p>So my suggestion is - if you plan on learning something about Linux, embedded devices, multimedia etc and are willing to spend some time reading about that and experimenting and having working multimedia device is only a bonus, Raspberrypi will be good choice. if all you need is multimedia player, buy something else, some finished product designed for this purpose.</p>

","<p>/dev/mmcblk0p2 is the root file system, so it is not easily unmounted. It could probably be re-mounted as read-only, but a simpler way is to schedule a fsck at the next reboot.</p>

<p>There is a similarly related post here but this person is beyond where I already am.</p>

<p><a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4162/citadel-server-along-apache-server-behind-a-router?rq=1"" title=""Pi Email Server"">Pi Email Server</a></p>
","<p>I have set up my pi for use as a web and mail server and it works just fine. So far I have been running from a standard 4GB SD card (with a few modifications described below) and it has had an uptime so far a little over three months.</p>

<p>It is not hard and there are many tutorials out there for setting these things up. Incidently I used most of the Ubuntu tutorials for setting up mail related items (postfix, dovecot, etc.). You should realise that there are very few differences between setting up a server on a raspberry pi and other machines so general Debian/Ubuntu guides should mostly apply to raspbian.</p>

<p>That being said there are a number of issues with the pi itself that you should address.</p>

<ul>
<li>Extend the lifespan of your SD card as described in <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/169/how-can-i-extend-the-life-of-my-sd-card"">this post.</a> I would say the more suggestions you take the better.</li>
<li>Remove the defualt user (pi).</li>
<li>Remove the graphical desktop as described in <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4745/how-to-uninstall-x-server-and-desktop-manager-when-running-as-headless-server"">this post.</a></li>
<li>Use the pi setup tool to minimize the amount of RAM used by the graphics processor (Hint: If you just set up ssh it does not need any).</li>
</ul>

<p>A few general server notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up your ports on the router (25 for mail, 22 for ssh, 80 for web and or the related ports for imap and pop3).</li>
<li>Setup the pi with a static IP address on the local network so the router has something to forward traffic to.</li>
<li>Use fail2ban or similar blacklisting tool. There are a lot of script kiddies out there.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the server itself I used the <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MailServer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ubuntu community wiki</a> to set up postfix with greylisting and dovecot. I would not bother with CLAM as it uses a lot of resources and simple greylisting removes something like 90% of spam mail anyway.</p>

<p>Another point is that if you don't care about the server being available 99.9% of the time you don't need to pay for a static IP. As long as the server is connected on a dynamic IP from you ISP it is not likely to change unless you unplug your router for a longer period of time. I have been having the same dynamically allocated IP for as long as the pi has been connected to the internet. And should it change it is a simple update of my DNS manangers website and a few hours later it is back online.</p>

<p>For webmail you will need a webserver. I would recommend nginx with roundcube. Plus side for using a webbased client is that you only need to open port 80 as all communication with between the mail server and client happens on the local machine.</p>

"Cheapest way to controlling multiple power sockets (lights) through Wi-Fi","64181","","<p>What I would like to see is the cheapest way possible to control my lights using my Raspberry Pi. </p>

<h3>What I imagine to control it</h3>

<p>I build an interface on my smartphone by which I can send commands to my Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi would then send a package (or something else) to a thing I can put inside my power socket (so I don't see it). Note that this thing should be connected through Wi-Fi (how else is it going to receive the message from my Raspberry Pi?).  </p>

<p>What is this <em>thing</em> and what is the cheapest possible way possible, as I am planning to connect a dozen or so lights?</p>
","<p>I'm using these items:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><a href=""http://www.elro.eu/en/products/cat/home-automation/home-easy-next/receivers-on-off2"">Receivers ON-OFF</a></em> to control my lights (you typically put a device in the walloutlet or instead of the walloutlet). They work in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band#ISM_bands"">433&nbsp;MHz band</a> (ISM).</li>
</ul>

<p>Out of the box you have a remote control which sends a signal to the receiving device and switch it on or off.</p>

<p>In my case, I created this situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Created an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"">HTML</a> site on my Raspberry Pi (<code>/switch.html</code>)</li>
<li>I call that page on my smartphone</li>
<li>On the page are four buttons (I control four devices / lights)</li>
<li>When I click a button, it asynchronously fires a call to <code>/switch.php</code> (the .php is on the Raspberry Pi)</li>
<li>The <code>switch.php</code> calls a <code>switch.py</code> program which controls the 433&nbsp;MHz
sender (see below)</li>
<li>The 433&nbsp;MHz sender does the same thing as the out of the box remote
control.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the sender, that is, the replacement for the standard remote control:
<em><a href=""http://www.miniinthebox.com/433mhz-wireless-transmitter-module-superregeneration-for-arduino-green_p411875.html"">433 MHz Wireless Transmitter Module Superregeneration for Arduino</a></em></p>

<p>I also created a scenario for out-of-house use.</p>

<p>I didn't want to connect my Raspberry Pi via my homerouter directly to the Internet, so I built myself another webpage (at my own domain) which does not control the Raspberry Pi directly, but it sends an email to a (known only to me) email (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail"">Gmail</a>) address.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi checks that email account every 10 minutes to see if there is any email. In that email I for instance say A on or B off.</p>

<p>So when we get home late and the lights are already off, we navigate to the site on my mobile (plans are to make it an Android app), click the button, the page gets posted and at the server an email gets sent, and in the next 0-10 minutes the Raspberry Pi checks the email, sees four new emails (A on, B on, C on and D on) and switches the lights on.</p>

<p><strong>How to get started</strong></p>

<p>So, to get started, these are the things I've done to get it all working.
In my case, I programmed the control of the 433&nbsp;MHz sender in Python (which is an easy language if you already know how to program).</p>

<p>First you install the <code>rpi.gpio</code> libary.</p>

<p>This library is used to control the little pins on your Raspberry Pi from your Python script. See <em><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/05/install-rpi-gpio-python-library/"">Install RPi.GPIO Python Library</a></em>.</p>

<p>Then you can optionally read the article <em><a href=""http://log.liminastudio.com/writing/tutorials/tutorial-how-to-use-your-raspberry-pi-like-an-arduino"">Tutorial: How to use your Raspberry Pi like an Arduino</a></em>, it's about what you can do with the <code>rpi.gpio</code> library, for instance blinking <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"">LEDs</a>.</p>

<p>It's not mandatory for the Elro light switching however.</p>

<p>Then you get the awesome code for the Elro commanding by HeikoHeiko, at <a href=""http://pastebin.com/aRipYrZ6"">http://pastebin.com/aRipYrZ6</a>. You paste that code in a file named '<code>switchelro.py</code>'.</p>

<p>You then change the string on line 94 to your own jumper settings (as you have set in your remote control and the walloutlet device. Check wether the combination remote-walloutlet device works before trying it with the Raspberry Pi. If it doesn't work with the standard components, it will probably fail with the Raspberry Pi too).</p>

<p>You then change the number of the pin your sender is attached to on line 97.</p>

<p>The pin number can be gotten from <em><a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals"">RPi Low-level peripherals</a></em> and in <em><a href=""http://elinux.org/File%3aRPi_P1_header.png"">File:RPi P1 header.png</a></em>.</p>

<p>You have to use the 1..26 count (the black image), not the GPIO34, GPIO24, etc. (green image).</p>

<p>Then you type this on the command prompt:</p>

<pre><code>sudo python switchelro.py 2 1
</code></pre>

<p>which means 'turn on B' (following this schema: <code>A = 1, B = 2, C = 4, D = 8, E = 16</code> for the first number, and 1=on, 0=off for the second).</p>

<p>I changed the <code>repeat = 10</code> on <code>line 30</code> to <code>repeat = 20</code> in the beginning (I don't remember why) and that works. I never retried it with the setting '10'.</p>

"What are the min/max voltage/current values the gpio pins can handle?","63194","","<p>I want to start using the GPIO pins but I am worried about short circuits or using too much amperage and frying my raspi. What are the Min/Max Voltage and Current values rasppi can handle? What is the typical voltage and current? How sensitive is raspi to short circuits and things like that?</p>

<hr>

<p>I have seen boards that are designed to 'protect' your raspi:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734"">http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't really want to 'extend' the usefulness of my raspi I just want to protect it from getting fried by my GPIO pins. I'm intending on making a buffer circuit that will prevent my raspi from getting damaged from experimenting with the GPIO pins.</p>
","<p>from: <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#General_Purpose_Input.2FOutput_.28GPIO.29"">http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#General_Purpose_Input.2FOutput_.28GPIO.29</a></p>

<p>GPIO voltage levels are <strong>3.3V</strong> and are <strong>not 5V tolerant</strong>. There is no over-voltage protection on the board - the intention is that people interested in serious interfacing will use an external board with buffers, level conversion and analog I/O rather than soldering directly onto the main board.</p>

<p>from: <a href=""http://www.mosaic-industries.com/embedded-systems/microcontroller-projects/raspberry-pi/gpio-pin-electrical-specifications#rpi-gpio-input-voltage-and-output-current-limitations"">http://www.mosaic-industries.com/embedded-systems/microcontroller-projects/raspberry-pi/gpio-pin-electrical-specifications#rpi-gpio-input-voltage-and-output-current-limitations</a></p>

<p>These are 3.3 volt logic pins. A voltage near 3.3 V is interpreted as a logic one while a voltage near zero volts is a logic zero. A GPIO pin should never be connected to a voltage source greater than 3.3V or less than 0V, as prompt damage to the chip may occur as the input pin substrate diodes (shown as parasitic FETs in Figure 1) conduct. There may be times when you may need to connect them to out-of-range voltages – in those cases the input pin current must be limited by an external resistor to a value that prevents harm to the chip. I recommend that you never source or sink more than <strong>0.5 mA</strong> into an input pin.</p>

"How can I use a bluetooth mouse and keyboard?","63020","","<p>I have a spare Mac keyboard that I'd like to use with my Raspberry Pi when it's plugged into my TV, so that I can use it for surfing internet on my TV.</p>

<p>Has anyone got a working configuration with a bluetooth mouse and keyboard, and a recipe for setting it up?</p>
","<p>I was able to get my Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad(without multitouch) working using the following steps:</p>

<p><strong>Packages &amp; Tools</strong></p>

<p>You only really need to install the 'bluetooth' package but, I used the following command to install some test tools and the GUI Bluetooth manager:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install bluetooth bluez blueman
</code></pre>

<p>Edit (2015-12-20): the original line above had <code>bluez-utils</code> instead of <code>bluez</code> - the package has been renamed.</p>

<p><strong>USB Dongle Detection</strong></p>

<p><code>lsusb</code> shows a new device. This is the output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0a12:0001 Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd. Bluetooth Dongle (HCI Mode)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will be other devices in the list, but that (or something very similar) is what you are looking for. </p>

<p>The <code>/etc/init.d/bluetooth status</code> command shows whether Bluetooth is running.</p>

<p>Output should be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bluetooth is running</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Scanning</strong></p>

<p>Switch your phone's Bluetooth to 'visible'. Then use the <em>hcitool scan</em> command to discover our devices initially:</p>

<p><code>hcitool scan</code> showed the following output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scanning ... A0:75:91:01:02:03 Nexus S</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Pairing</strong></p>

<p>Once you are able to see a device using <code>hcitool scan</code>, start a GUI session. </p>

<p>Under <code>LXDE Menu&gt;Preferences&gt;Bluetooth Manager</code>, you will find the Blueman GUI Bluetooth manager. </p>

<p>From there, you can scan and pair bluetooth devices as expected in any GUI system.</p>

<p>and that is what worked for me. Original tutorial found <a href=""http://www.dreamgreenhouse.com/projects/2012/rpibt/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT: This apparently only works for using the apple setup in the GUI. Once GUI session is logged out, Apple keyboard ceases to function. That means this is at best a partial and non-practical solution.</strong></p>

"Can I emulate x86 CPU to run Teamspeak 3 server?","62683","","<p>Reading different posts and 
<a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/1312/can-i-emulate-x86-to-run-windows-95"">Can I emulate x86 to run Windows 95?</a>
it seems to be possible to some extent to simulate x86 CPU.</p>

<p>In my special case I want to run a Teamspeak server, which isn't provided for ARM at the moment.
Is it possible to emulate Teamspeak server?</p>

<p>I know there exists the native alternative mumble. But that is no alternative for me, because in the game community I'm in Teamspeak 3 is the only one used.</p>
","<p>I got Teamspeak 3 running using qemu running a x86 Debian squeeze. There is some room for improvement for sure, but for now that's what worked for me. I hope I didn't forget something.</p>

<p>First of all thanks to Dietmar and meigrafd of the raspberry pi forum. Without their work I wouldn't have succeeded.</p>

<p><strong>How to</strong></p>

<p><strong>Installing qemu</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>We need some software <code>apt-get install git zlib1g-dev libsdl1.2-dev</code></li>
<li>Download the source of qemu (<code>wget 198.154.101.186/RaspberryPI/qemudidi2.rar</code>) already patched by Dietmar for Raspberry pi. It is qemu 0.15.50 from Thoronir, because the support for ARM host seems to be even worse with the current version.</li>
<li>Unrar it <code>unrar x qemuADLI.part1.rar</code>. You have to use the unrar non-free version (<a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/3617/how-to-install-unrar-nonfree"">Link to howto</a>)</li>
<li>Configure what to compile (takes about a minute)
<code>./configure --target-list=""i386-softmmu"" --enable-sdl --extra-cflags=""-O3 -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=vfp -mcpu=arm1176jzf-s -mtune=arm1176jzf-s -march=armv6zk"" --audio-drv-list=""alsa oss sdl pa"" --audio-card-list=""ac97 es1370 sb16 cs4231a adlib gus hda""</code></li>
<li>Now compile <code>make</code> (takes half an hour at least)</li>
<li>Now install <code>make install</code></li>
<li>Now qemu is installed successfully.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Preparing Debian Image</strong> (using Windows as host)</p>

<ol start=""8"">
<li><p>Download and install qemu for Windows (<a href=""http://qemu.weilnetz.de/w32/qemu-w32.exe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Link</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Download Debian netinstall image (<a href=""http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/6.0.6/i386/iso-cd/debian-6.0.6-i386-netinst.iso"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">squeeze</a>). I used squeeze, but wheezy might be also good.</p></li>
<li><p>Create image using <code>qemu-img.exe create -f qcow2 G:\debian.img 1500M</code>(smaller size should be suffient too)</p></li>
<li><p>Install debian x86. I recommend to choose no meta package. <code>qemu -cpu 486 -hda G:\debian.img -cdrom G:\debian-6.0.4-i386-netinst.iso -boot d -m 512 -smp 1</code></p></li>
<li><p>After installation run the qemu command again, but with some changes <code>qemu -cpu 486 -hda G:\debian.img -boot d -m 512 -smp 1 -redir tcp:9022::22 -redir udp:1234::9987</code>. -redir is used to redirect the network from the guest to the hosts ports.</p></li>
<li><p>Now install less and your favorite editor (like nano, vim,etc.) you like to use <code>apt-get install less vim</code></p></li>
<li><p>Install OpenSSH Server <code>apt-get install openssh-server</code></p></li>
<li><p>Install Teamspeak like you usually would do.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect to teamspeak from you windows host using localhost:1234 (remember above we redirected the port)</p></li>
<li><p>Test to connect to it via ssh/putty using localhost:9022</p></li>
<li><p>Shutdown <code>shutdown -hP now</code> the image and copy it via scp(winscp) to your pi.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Run it on the Pi</strong> (Use a SSH for the following commands)</p>

<ol start=""19"">
<li><p>Get the missing qemu Bios <code>wget -O /usr/share/qemu/sgabios.bin http://qemu.weilnetz.de/w32/2012-06-28/sgabios.bin</code></p></li>
<li><p>Start it! <code>qemu -cpu 486 -hda debian.img -m 150m -smp 1 -redir tcp:9022::22 -redir udp:9055::9987 --nographic</code></p></li>
<li><p>If you get a memory error then try it a few times.</p></li>
<li><p>If it says starting Grub then wait some minutes (it's booting in the background, but you will never get a prompt here!). Now login with a other SSH terminal to login 'ssh root@localhost -p 9022'</p></li>
<li><p>Now start Teamspeak and try to log in on port 9055 of the Pi.</p></li>
<li><p>Shutdown again the qemu guest.</p></li>
<li><p>Start it again but add -daemonize, so it runs even when you log off. I also made a <a href=""http://pastebin.com/a4gBVUgJ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">script</a> to help me.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<p>My Pi is the 256 MB version overclocked to 1000 Mhz using raspi-config.</p>

<p>The Pi runs constantly at 70% CPU load average. It varies between 50% (using 700 MHz) and nearly 100% using 1000 MHz. But the load shows  ""0.77, 0.83, 0.80"", which is okay.</p>

<p>In the future I hope to either use a native Teamspeak version (my hope is still up) or to use qemu in user mode and better performance with more current version. Time will tell :)</p>

<p>I have yet to test the performance of teamspeak itself, if it is usable for gaming situations. I noticed some milliseconds latence overhead, but not too much to worry yet.</p>

<p>The wireless static IP worked, but the eth0 didn't. </p>

<p>So I tried to do the config in <strong>/etc/dhcpcd.conf</strong>:</p>

<li><p>How to check which service has priority or someting? And which
service uses <strong>/etc/network/interface</strong>?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>There are good points in all the answers to this question, but I think that there is some scope for addressing your specific questions directly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>When to use which file?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm going to make the assumption that you are suffering from a general degree of confusion that is occurring at the moment (in the wider Raspberry Pi community) with the introduction of Debian '<a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-jessie-is-here/"">Jessie</a>' in place of Debian 'Wheezy'. This change has made a large number of tutorials at worst obsolete and at best confusing. </p>

<p>The answer to the question is that when using Wheezy it was normal to make changes to the <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> file for the purposes of setting up network interfaces (go figure). When using Jessie, it will be necessary to make changes to '/etc/dhcpcd.conf'. However, if making changes to a wireless connection (<code>wlan0</code>) you will also need to make changes to <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code> which is where you add the network ssid and password.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>Why the wifi worked with /etc/network/interfaces but the eth0 didn't?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure how the wifi connection could have worked since there is some information missing from your files (ssid at the least). As janos pointed out, the priority of the etho connection details coming after the wlan0 details probably made them operative (since they would have been seen last by the process reading the file).</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>Does dhcpcd has somehow priority over /etc/network/interface?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they're different and are designed to suit different purposes under Jessie. For the purposes of using Jessie in a fairly simple way you can pretty much ignore the <code>interfaces</code> file and work with <code>dhcpcd.conf</code> and <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""4"">
  <li>How to check which service has priority or someting? And which service uses /etc/network/interface?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Again I'm going to make the assumption that the question is more of a '<em>Which file do I use and if I have to use one which takes priority?</em>' question. The answer is that with the change from Wheezy to Jessie (and in a broader sense with the adoption of <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/2841873/meet-systemd-the-controversial-project-taking-over-a-linux-distro-near-you.html"">systemd</a>) the configuration of `dhcpcd.conf' and  'wpa_supplicant.conf' will be the norm and the 'interfaces' file will be left to it's own devices. </p>

<p>What does this mean for you?</p>

<p>Well (again) making an assumption that you're trying to set up a hard wired (eth0) and wireless (wlan0) connections with static IP addresses, you would want your <code>interfaces</code> file to be the default as it was initially installed;</p>

<pre><code># Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd
# For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'

# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface eth0 inet manual

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

allow-hotplug wlan1
iface wlan1 inet manual
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
</code></pre>

<p>You would want your <code>dhcpcd.conf</code> file to include the connection details at the end of the file for both interfaces and the additional entries would probably look a bit like this;</p>

<pre><code># Custom static IP address for eth0.
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.0.115/24
static routers=192.168.0.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1

# Custom static IP address for wlan0.
interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.0.115/24
static routers=192.168.0.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly you would want to edit your <a href=""https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-pcduinos-wifi-dongle-with-the-pi/edit-wpasupplicantconf""><code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code></a> file so that it includes the ssid for the wifi network and the password. It should probably look a bit like this;</p>

<pre><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid=""homenetwork""
    psk=""h0mepassw0rd""
}
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that covers it off. There is the very real possibility that my assumptions are incorrect, but since I recently went through a similar learning curve I'm hoping the data is useful.</p>

<p>I've actually written this up and you can get the information in the free ebook <a href=""https://leanpub.com/jerpi"">Just enough Raspberry Pi</a> from Leanpub.</p>

<p>i rather update the firmware of raspberry first before installing them because i have problem with <code>rpi-bluetooth</code> package so i do:</p>

<pre><code>sudo rpi-update
</code></pre>

<p>and make it install and advance to next step.</p>

<h2>2. Edit Configuration and applied it</h2>

<p>First add pi username to the group pulseaudio with</p>

<pre><code>sudo usermod -a -G lp pi
</code></pre>

<p>create new config under /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf using text editor and add the following line</p>

<pre><code>[General]:
Enable=Source,Sink,Media,Socket
</code></pre>

<p>edit file <code>/etc/bluetooth/main.conf</code>using your preferred text editor (I'm using nano).</p>

<p>Set Bluetooth Class, Modify the following line to:</p>

<pre><code> Class = 0x00041C
</code></pre>

<p><code>0x000041C</code> means that the rpi bluetooth support A2DP protocol.</p>

<p>change <code>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf</code>
add / modify (don't forget to check the code thoroughly before adding them), and change</p>

<pre><code>resample-method = trivial
</code></pre>

<p>you can using any method you like, i personally using <code>speex-float-3</code> for reference you can see this <a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/PulseAudio"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a></p>

<p>start pulseaudio service with:</p>

<pre><code>pulseaudio -D
</code></pre>

<p>we are going to use ragusa87 script to automate the bluetooth source to audio sink. First please add new configuration to udev init.d by editing file <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-input.rules</code> and add this to the file</p>

<pre><code>SUBSYSTEM=""input"", GROUP=""input"", MODE=""0660""
KERNEL==""input[0-9]*"", RUN+=""/usr/lib/udev/bluetooth""
</code></pre>

<p>add folder <code>udev</code> to <code>/usr/lib</code> by using mkdir</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir /usr/lib/udev &amp;&amp; cd /usr/lib/udev
</code></pre>

<p>and add this to the file bluetooth (credits ragusa87)</p>

<h2>3. Pair and Connect the audio</h2>

<p>go to terminal and type <code>bluetoothctl</code>. First activate bluetooth with <code>power on</code> and then <code>agent on</code>, set the default agent that you've been editing before with <code>default-agent</code>, and then set discoverable mode and pair mode on with <code>discoverable on; pairable on</code>. You should see raspberrypi bluetooth on your phone or laptop and you can pair it on the phone by clicking it and touch pair. On the terminal you type y. Back to the terminal, you connect to the phone by type <code>connect xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx</code> where <code>xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x</code>x is you phone bluetooth mac address. and don't forget to trust with <code>trust xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx</code> <code>where xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx</code> is your phone bluetooth mac address And voila you have bluetooth amplifier (or whatever the name is) by using raspberry.</p>

<h2>4. Conclusion</h2>

<p>after trying and experimenting, i found out the audio quality is low and i rather not using it as the raspberry will be freeze if you using it with the song being streaming to the raspberry. I advice to use UPNP speaker project by using gmediarenderer. The audio is superb and there's no delay and scatter sound and it can play lossless audio file (flac, wav, dll).

"Powering a PI from 12V","59533","","<p>I'm thinking of installing my Pi down at my wife's stables which have a 40W solar charged 12V DC lighting circuit.</p>

<p>Since the Pi runs at 5V I'm thinking that a quick and easy way to step down the voltage safely would be to use a microUSB mobile phone car charger such as <a href=""http://www.maplin.co.uk/micro-usb-in-car-charger-390581"">this</a></p>

<p>Also I figure that the Pi should only be drawing about 2.5W (5V x 500mA) so the demand on the available power should be fine &amp; the phone charger can cope with up to 850mA current so should be able to cope with a Pi.</p>

<p>I'll then use one of <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0056WJP1M/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"">these</a> for the display (12V so should be simple).</p>

<li>Am I making sense here?</li>
<li>Are there any other gotchas you can think of that I need to be worried about?</li>

<li>In XBMC, go to Programs → Raspbmc settings → Wired network configuration.</li>
<li>Uncheck the Automatic DHCP option.</li>
<li>Provide a static IP address. Make sure the IP address is far away from the IP addresses typically assigned by the router to the networked devices at home. For example, if a router assigns addresses starting from 192.168.0.10, then pick a static IP like 192.168.0.50</li>

"How to correctly install the python RPi.GPIO library","56371","","<p>I downloaded RPi.GPIO 5.3a from here: <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO</a></p>

<p>I extracted the tar file, cd into the folder and ran:</p>

<pre><code>sudo python setup.py install
</code></pre>

<p>It ran through a bunch of stuff and doesn't seem to have failed. The last line of its work is this:</p>

<pre><code>Writing /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/RPi.GPIO-0.5.3a.egg-info
</code></pre>

<p>After that it was done and gave me back control.</p>

<p>Now I type</p>

<pre><code>sudo python
</code></pre>

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>import RPi.GPIO
</code></pre>

<p>and I see </p>

<pre><code>ImportError: No module named GPIO
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone point me to exactly what steps I need to take to get the python GPIO library installed correctly so I can import it and manipulate the GP pins? I've found a mish mash of different processes online (this was the one that came up most often) but I have thus far been unable to get any of them to work. </p>
","<p>Not sure if this is helpful, but under the latest copy of Raspbian I was able to install RPi.GPIO directly from the main repositories using apt-get as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install python-rpi.gpio
</code></pre>

<p>If you're running Python 3 (<code>idle3</code> on the command line) instead of Python 2 (<code>python</code> on the command line) you need to install the RPi.GPIO library with this command instead:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get -y install python3-rpi.gpio

"Add an external antenna to a Pi 3","55807","","<p>Makezine's <a href=""http://makezine.com/2016/02/28/meet-the-new-raspberry-pi-3/"">writeup</a> on the Pi 3 this morning included a somewhat tantalising section:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EuIHC.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EuIHC.jpg"" alt=""Photo of the Pi 3 rear""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The other interesting thing on the back of the board, right next to
  the wireless radio chip, is something that looks like an unpopulated
  UFL antenna, labelled J13 on the silk screen. You can just seen the
  board’s antenna in the image above on the flip side of the board
  directly below the unpopulated contacts.</p>
  
  <p>While we’re not going to get any support from the Foundation — it
  would break the terms of their FCC certification to document it — I’m
  looking forward to the first hack to add a cantenna to the Raspberry
  Pi either by desoldering the on-board antenna, or making use of those
  unpopulated pads on the back of the board. Cheap long range Wi-Fi is
  just a Pringle’s can away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it sound plausible that a long-range antenna might be connected to the J13 pads shown in the above image? Are similar kludges available on other small single-board computers, and if so what kind of performance might be expected?</p>
","<p>Yes, it can be done, but beware of violating FCC.  </p>

"Problems starting X","55741","","<p>Just whacked Raspian on an SD card, and booted up my Pi.</p>

<p>A message at the top says 'Use <code>startx</code> to start a graphical interface'.</p>

<p>So I <code>startx</code>.</p>

<p>I get a load of details: OS version; X version; all that lot.</p>

<p>And then it stops. The program doesn't close, it just sits there, as if it's working something out or something.</p>

<p>This nothing-happening-state stays there seemingly, forever.</p>

<p>I'm running Raspbian, and accessing the Pi through SSH on a Windows machine.</p>

<p>I assume the problem is something to do with SSH, as surely the recommended distro wouldn't normally fail when accessing a common, advertised command?</p>

<p>So how do I launch X when using SSH?</p>

","<p>That display of information you see is <code>Xorg</code> starting up. The reason is starts but doesn't show anything is because there is no graphical output connected to the Pi, such as a monitor or TV. Thus <code>Xorg</code> doesn't know how to handle the <code>XSession</code>.</p>

<p>There are a few possible solutions, depending on what you are trying to achieve.</p>

<ul>

There doesn't seem to be any error.</p>

<p>How do I get TightVncServer to start on Pi Reboot?</p>
","<p>Before starting ensure your Pi is connected to the internet\network via Ethernet\wifi.</p>

<p>Open the Terminal and enter the following commands:</p>

<p><strong>Get Pi IP Address for remote connection (for use later)</strong></p>

<pre><code>hostname -I
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Install TightVncServer</strong></p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
tightvncserver
</code></pre>

<p>The first time this is run you must enter a password and verify it. No need to enter a view only password.</p>

<p>To configure for auto start as a service when the Pi boots up:</p>

<p><strong>Open nano (text editor) to create a file to auto start Tight VNC Server</strong>
    sudo nano /etc/init.d/tightvncserver</p>

<p><strong>Type in the following (or <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4474/tightvnc-copy-paste-between-local-os-and-raspberry-pi"">copy and paste</a>):</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit the permissions of this file to make it executable and active:</strong></p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/tightvncserver
sudo update-rc.d tightvncserver defaults
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Reboot to test</strong>
    sudo reboot</p>

<p>For Windows: <a href=""http://www.tightvnc.com/download.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TightVNC Client for example</a> . No need to install server.</p>

<p><strong>Start The VNC Client</strong>
Connect using the IP address from the top of this post. Change the IP address for yours. The port number in a number of internet posts is only listed as 2 digits. This is short hand and if you are using the above script your pi is running on port 1 then you should use 590<strong>1</strong>. If 2, then 590<strong>2</strong> etc. </p>

"How to get Wi-Fi to connect on boot?","54774","","<p>Raspberry Pi Model B<br>
OS: Raspbian </p>

<p>I am running my Pi headless (currently through a direct Ethernet connection). I have a USB WiFi dongle. I would like to have the WiFi start up at boot and connect by DHCP.</p>

<p><a href=""http://rpi.tnet.com/project/faqs/headlessportablewifi"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://rpi.tnet.com/project/faqs/headlessportablewifi</a> suggests that I don't need to actually change <strong>/etc/network/interfaces</strong> from the default:</p>

<pre><code>auto lo

iface lo inet loopback

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp
</code></pre>

<p>I have configured <strong>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</strong> for my network. </p>

<p>When I boot the Pi, WiFi does not immediately connect. But if I SSH in and run <code>sudo ifup wlan0</code>, the Pi connects fine. </p>

<p>Isn't this something the Pi should do in its own boot process? I could presumably write tell some dotfile to run this command, but I would like to do it the proper way (and learn how my system works).</p>

<p>I know I can also set a static IP address for each WiFi network I want to use: <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/11631/wifi-setup-for-multiple-networks/11738"">How to setup multiple WiFi networks?</a>. But I would prefer to have a simple solution where I only have to enter a couple lines on <strong>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</strong> to add a new WiFi network. </p>

<p>What is the piece I am missing here?</p>
","<p>The default Raspbian <strong>/etc/network/interfaces</strong> configuration does not connect to WiFi on boot. The key lines of the interfaces man-page are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lines  beginning with the word ""auto"" are used to identify the
  physical interfaces to be brought up when ifup is run with the
  -a  option.  (This option is used by the system boot scripts.)</p>

  <p>Lines  beginning with the word ""auto"" are used to identify the
   physical interfaces to be brought up when ifup is run with the
   -a  option.  (This option is used by the system boot scripts.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first missing piece was the line <code>auto wlan0</code>. As far as I know, it can go anywhere in the file. </p>

<p>That works until you try booting without the ethernet cable plugged in. Then, WiFi doesn't connect on boot and has to be manually triggered by running <code>sudo ifup wlan0</code> or unplugging and reinserting the Wi-Fi dongle. </p>

<p>The problem is caused by the <strong>ifplugd</strong> daemon, which turns network devices on and off when you plug them in or remove them. You can reconfigure it, or you can simply remove it with <code>sudo apt-get purge ifplugd</code>. </p>

<p>If you have removed <strong>ifplugd</strong>, you should add the following lines to <strong>/etc/network/interfaces</strong> so that the ethernet connection will also connect when plugged in:</p>

<pre><code>auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if the <code> auto</code> lines are strictly necessary or if hotplug handles booting correctly in the absence of <strong>ifplugd</strong>, but this worked for me. </p>

<p>The problem seems to be that the adapter has power management features enabled by default. This can be checked by running the command:</p>

<pre><code>cat /sys/module/8192cu/parameters/rtw_power_mgnt

<p>A value of 0 means disabled, 1 means min. power management, 2 means max. power management. To disable this, you need to create a new file:</p>

<p>and add the following:</p>

  <p>NTPd is the most common method to synchronize the software clock of a GNU/Linux system with internet time servers using the Network Time Protocol.</p>

<p>NTPd should already be installed and set up on the default operating system, Debian Squeeze. You will need to install and configure it manually though for Arch Linux.</p>

Is there some way I can prevent this or strengthen something so it doesn't happen if the power goes out? Any suggestions? Thanks!</p>

<p>P.S. My zip file was not corrupted and my extraction service is Win32DiskImager</p>
","<p>I'm not going to write about checking your HW and compatible SD card lists, because you most probably have already checked all these. What I'm about to write is the permanent solution, that allows to nip the problem in the bud, and <strong>permanently</strong> fix the issue.</p>

<p>If you don't want your SD card to get broken when you flip the power switch, you have to use it in a read-only mode. If there's nothing being written to your SD card, it won't get damaged no matter what you do.</p>

<p>Obvious (but non-working) solution would be an attempt to flip ""read-only"" switch on the side of the SD card, unfortunately this does not work because the schematics shows this switch is routed nowhere and its position is generally ignored.</p>

<p>Another, more subtle (but working) approach would be modifying your <code>/etc/fstab</code> to mount all your partitions read-only. The drawback of this approach is your logs have to be written somewhere else (USB stick, RAM drive?) and in case of RAM drive the logs won't persist during reboot. To do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Copy an RPi image to your SD card using any method you like.</li>
<li>Boot from SD and <code>raspi-config</code> will start automatically. Do not ""Expand filesystem"", just set up your time zone and international settings.</li>
<li><p>Run <code>sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0</code>, press 'p' to print the current partition table. Then enter the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>n        Create a new partition
[enter]  Make a primary partition
[enter]  Use the default number
[#]      1 greater than the end of mmcblk0p2
[enter]  Expand to the end of the SD card
w        Write the partition table and exit
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Edit <code>/etc/fstab</code>. It should look something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>proc            /proc     proc    defaults 0 0
/dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot     vfat    ro       0 0
/dev/mmcblk0p2  /         ext4    ro       0 0
/dev/mmcblk0p3  /home     ext4    defaults,errors=remount-ro  0  1
none            /var/run  ramfs   size=1M  0 0
none            /var/log  ramfs   size=1M  0 0
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Run <code>sudo partprobe</code> to recognize the new partition.</p></li>
<li>Format your new partition with <code>sudo mkfs --type ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p3</code>.</li>
<li>Reboot.</li>
</ol>

<p>If for some reason you need to make changes to your system, you can remount the read-only partitions with write access:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/mmcblk0p2

"Possible to reinstall X server and use graphical after having removed it?","52048","","<p>I've used my raspberry pi for about 2 years now and in the beginning I removed the X server as I thought I'd never use it. (I followed the tips here to remove <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4745/how-to-uninstall-x-server-and-desktop-manager-when-running-as-headless-server"">How to uninstall X Server and Desktop Manager when running as headless server?</a>).</p>

<p>Now I want to be able to run X server and have graphics.</p>

<p>I've been entertaining the idea of wiping the SD card and just doing a new installation with X already working but I've configured the Raspbian I have now quite extensively and I don't want to do it again.</p>

<p>My preferred method would be to just install X and get it working again into the Raspbian I already have there. Is it possible? How would I go about doing that?</p>
","<p>Linux uses a heterogeneous GUI stack, meaning it's arranged in layers but there's different layers you can arrange.</p>

<p>The bottom of the stack is relatively homogeneous, meaning it's almost always the same.  This is the Xorg server joan has indicated.</p>

<p>However, while X all by itself does provide you with a graphical desktop, it doesn't look like much -- plain black screen with a cursor.  This makes just launching applications difficult, since there are no menus or taskbars either.  You can configure a terminal to launch at start up and go from there, but realistically, additional software is needed.</p>

<p>This is where the next two layers, the <strong>window manager</strong> (WM) and <strong>desktop environment</strong> (DE) come in.  The latter requires the former but not vice versa.  There are stand-alone WM's that have most of the features associated with a graphical desktop, but linux distros usually use a more minimal WM with a heftier DE on top.</p>

<p>The default DE on Raspbian <em>was</em> (keep reading) <code>lxde</code>.  If you want that back, I imagine <code>apt install lxde</code> should do it.  There may be more pieces needed in the end -- you can see a list of possibilities with <code>apt-cache search lxde</code>. The other common linux DE's are also available, but most of them consume more resources which is why lxde was chosen as the default on the pi.</p>

<p>Note that this does not include a graphical login, which is the task of a <strong>display manager</strong> (DM).  The default on raspbian is <code>lightdm</code>, which you can install with <code>apt-get install lightdm</code>.</p>

<p>To sum up the two parts you'd need to get the original GUI system back would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apt install lxde lxde-core lxterminal lxappearance</code></li>
<li><code>apt install lightdm</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These should drag in X and other dependencies if they are not there already.  If you wish to start X from the command line using <code>startx</code> or <code>xinit</code>, you'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apt install xinit</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The new default DE is the Pi Foundation's tweaked branch of LXDE, PIXEL.  Apparently you can install that with: </p>

<pre><code>apt install raspberrypi-ui-mods
</code></pre>

<p>This may or may not include a display manager for GUI logins.</p>

"Stream videos wirelessly from PC to Pi to TV?","52042","","<p>I have a collection of movies (Please note: Mostly 1080p) on my external hard disk drive. This drive is attached to my PC (Mac). The external hard disk also contains some important work files, hence I will not be able to detach it from my Mac.</p>

<p>I have a 32"" TV in the hallroom nearby. I can attach the output of my Pi, through HDMI to my TV. Now all I need to do is stream the video content from my Mac, to my TV through the Pi. Both my Pi and Mac are connected to the same Wifi network. The Pi is connected wirelessly too, if that helps. Both rooms are nearby as well, very with both the Mac and the Pi also close to the wifi router.</p>

<p>I would simply like to replicate my Mac's screen on to my TV in the hallroom. This way I can play anything I want and it will show up on my TV. </p>

<p><strong>I have some couple of doubts, though:</strong></p>

<p>First of all, is this possible? 
If yes, will the video be choppy?
Do I need to buy the additional codecs?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>If you want to use the PI exclusively as a HTPC or media center, you could use a distribution geared towards such applications. OpenELEC/XBMC /RasBMC seem to be the obvious choice. I did try OpenELEC at one time, but getting WiFi to work reliably on it seemed to be a pain.</p>

<p>Here's how I went about using Raspbian (since I use the RPi for tasks other than media playback) for playing back media on the Pi:</p>

<ol>
<li>Share the (external) drive with media on LAN, mount the same on the RPi as a samba share.</li>
<li>Use a player like OMXPlayer to playback your videos on the Pi itself. The newer builds available here supports subtitles and multiple audio streams.</li>
<li>Run a web-interface like <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=35&amp;t=34723"">this</a> one or control the media player via SSH.</li>
<li>You could add the samba share mount command &amp; remote/web interface startup of the media player to <code>~/.bash_login</code> file so that every time you login, the Pi is ready to play media.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are some drawbacks to this kind of a setup the most important one being that not all formats can be decoded and played back on the Pi, but .mp4s and .mkvs seemed fine most of the time. If the Pi stutters sometimes when playing back 1080p videos, you could try overclocking via <code>raspi-config</code> (playback is smooth most of the time with 900Mhz).</p>

<p>Screen ""mirroring"" can be achieved via VNC, you could install a VNC server on the host machine and access it via a VNC viewer running on RPi. While this might be useful for accessing text or images, video playback via such a setup will most likely be horrible.</p>

<p>What are my options? Will any hardware supported by gpsd work with the Pi?</p>

<p>You can also use GPIO and a traditional NMEA 0183 GPS receiver, but then you need to worry about power, and the prices are often higher. GPS antannas are common onboard boats and ships, and usually consume 12v.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does it mean that, without this licence, the RPi cannot handle at all MPEG-2 video, or it will struggle to play it smoothly?</li>
<li>In what form comes the licence? Is it a file to install in the ditribution? Or is it a hardware activation or something?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>The license enables you to decode and encode (where applicable) the mentioned media types using the built in <strong>hardware</strong> encoders/decoders. </p>

<ul>
<li>H.264 Encode is enabled in the latest version (Included in Pi Price) which is great! </li>
<li>For an extra £2.40 you can watch MPEG2 video, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2"">ie DVD's are encoded in MPEG2!</a> </li>
<li>For an extra £1.20 you can decode VC-1 video, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC-1"">ie Microsoft's Silverlight Video</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Hardware en/decoders are much faster and do not rely on the core CPU to process these files; rather the GPU is used to process the files. It talks directly to the Video Memory (decoding) or RAM (encoding) making it nice and smooth. You do not need this license and can use software versions. But it is really slow.</p>

<p>The license will be a file you place somewhere or a key you define as a global variable for the system. The en/decoder libraries will request these and pass them into the hardware where they will be resolved on that chip; if the key matches the serial number and is valid you will be allowed to use the exposed API (I can see this getting hacked very quickly).</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi did not include this to keep costs down. For us, a few quid is ok, but if they made a million units that is £3.6million extra they have to spend on something only a fraction of people will use.</p>

"Does the Raspberry Pi need a cooling system?","51594","","<p>Searching on Newegg for ""raspberry pi"", the results included <em>many</em> heatsinks and as well as a few other types of cooling systems, yet these items do not seem to appear when looking through <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/buy/"">the stores of the official distributors</a>.</p>

<p>Does the Raspberry Pi need some sort of cooling system for its processor such as a heatsink? If one is not <em>always</em> required, are there special situations where a cooling system would be necessary (operating in an outdoor environment where temperatures may reach 35°C during the day)? Or is the temperature more related to how hard the processor is working?</p>

<p>Do home-made cases for the Raspberry Pi need to include some sort of ventilation or fan to avoid temperature buildups?</p>

<p>note that from the picture, the main component that gets hot is the USB/ethernet hub - by far, this MAY warrant a heatsink if you are using those components heavily, it has restricted airflow due to a case/etc. and it is in a warmer environment, or some combination thereof.</p>

<p>The second component that gets warm in the image is the 3.3v regulator - this is to be expected from a linear regulator, and basically a non-issue in the new + editions of the pi. These pieces are designed to heat up (that is how they work), so I would not be concerned with this piece needing a heatsink.</p>

<p>Finally, the CPU (and memory which is above the CPU) - this is unlikely to need a heatsink since it will throttle itself if it gets too hot - if you do notice throttling, then you may want a heatsink (and you could run into this if you overclock.. but if you really are THAT desperate for more CPU power, perhaps the Pi isn't for you...)</p>

<p>edit to add new model:</p>

","<p>OpenELEC appears to be an intentionally confined, minimal operating system.  I assume it is simple to use, partially because you cannot do much with it beyond Kodi.</p>

<p>Part of this is that it does not have much of a ""package management"" system.

<li>Can you log in to SSH from the Raspberry Pi itself, use <code>ssh 127.0.0.1</code> (actually use 127.0.0.1), if this does not work then it is likely that SSH is not set-up correctly, the error may give a clue to the problem.</li>
<li>Can you now try to log in to SSH from the Raspberry Pi itself, but this time use the actual address and port <code>ssh 192.168.0.198 -p 22</code> (but with the IP address you are using for SSH), if this does not work it may point to a problem with the firewall on Linux, or that SSH is set-up to only use certain connections or a different port number</li>
<li>If all of the above work fine then it is probably something like a firewall problem with the router, it may help to try some different port numbers</li>
</ol>

<p>To add extra port numbers do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Backup the SSH configuration using <code>sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.old</code></li>
<li>Edit the SSH configuration using <code>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></li>
<li>Look for the line that says <code>Port 22</code></li>
<li>Add some additional lines below with some other port numbers, I would suggest a different well-known number, e.g. <code>Port 80</code>, and a largish number, e.g. <code>Port 55555</code></li>
<li>Restart the SSH service using <code>sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart</code></li>
<li>Try using putty with each number you added in turn, in my case <code>80</code> does not work because we have a web server the router forwards to, but <code>55555</code> worked fine</li>

"Execute Python Scripts Via Web interface","50839","","<p>I have seen a lot of projects which claim to control the GPIO pins, but I want something a bit different, for example, to be able to blink an LED.</p>

<p>Is there a system out there where, via a web interface, I can click and execute a python script, for example ""blink.py"" on my raspberry. </p>
","<p>You could make this happen in any number of ways using CGI or other server side script. One problem will be permissions to accessing GPIO pins. <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/42122/set-gpio-permissions-cleanly"">There doesn't seem to be a clean solution</a>. Currently it might be easiest to <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=8999&amp;p=105567"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chown the gpio files</a> to the user that runs the web server, <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/33526/2856"">call a (suid) program that can access the pins</a> or have a separate daemon with access to the pins that you can send messages to (signal, pipe/socket, other ipc...).</p>

<p>For ""executing a python script via a web interface"", you might want to look at <a href=""http://webpy.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">web.py</a>. It's a very neat little module that lets you write a single file standalone ""web service"" that could do anything. Very handy for this kind of thing IME. Requires effectively no configuration or special software (apart from common python install and web.py itself). Just write handlers for urls in python, optionally with html templates and run. Point a client (browser, other script, wget..) at the right port and it just works. :)</p>

<p>Edit: A new project spotted, <a href=""https://github.com/602p/serpint"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">serpint</a> seems to allow wiggling gpio from a socket or possibly fake char device interface.</p>

"Boot from external USB stick / drive?","50743","","<p>I know it's not possible to directly boot from an external USB stick / drive, but instead you have to boot from the SD card and then the external device can take over. What's the easiest and preferred way to set this up, therefore boot from SD card and then let an external device take over? </p>
","<p>If you have an existing OS running on the Pi, then firstly it would be useful to know if the USB device is supported. You can do this by mounting it like normal:</p>

<pre><code>mount /dev/sda1 /mnt 
</code></pre>

<p>If that fails then you wont be able to use the USB device as a root partition without enabling the kernel modules for it. And for that you may need to compile your own kernel.</p>

<p>If it suceeds then it should work fine with some tweaking of the boot parameters that the Pi uses:</p>

<p>On an existing image, open <code>cmdline.txt</code>, which can be found on the boot partition, and enter the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 
root=/dev/sda1 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait text
</code></pre>

<p>All you must then do is flash that image to the SD card and boot the Pi. If all is well, <code>/dev/sda1</code> should be the location of the USB drive when the Pi boots, and thus it should attempt to use that location as root. The <code>rootwait</code> parameter is important as it will make the boot process hang until the USB drive is recognised. Without it the Pi may complain that the location doesn't exist.</p>

<p>I suggest that you copy the root partition from an existing Raspberry Pi image to your USB drive and use that to boot from.</p>

<p>Let me know if you need any further information.</p>

","<p>The network module is a a BCM43438. I'm having trouble finding a source I fully trust, but from a cursory view, it looks like it only supports 2.4 GHz. Since the Raspberry Pi foundation doesn't specify, it'd be normal to assume a lack of 5 GHz.</p>

","<p>You can use the command-line <code>fbi</code> app (""framebuffer image viewing"").  The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_framebuffer"">framebuffer</a> is also what <code>oxmplayer</code> uses.  Fbi is available from the raspbian repos and should be in any other GNU/Linux distro as well; it is not specific to the pi.</p>

<p>It takes a filename or series of filenames, and you can use shell globbing for this, so e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>fbi *.jpg

<p>Will show all the .jpg files in your current directory.  For instructions on how to advance from one picture in the list to the next, see the <strong>KEYS</strong> section of <code>man fbi</code>.  You can also set an automated slideshow with the <code>-t</code> option.</p>

<p>You may get this error:</p>

<pre><code>ioctl VT_GETSTATE: Invalid argument (not a linux console?)
</code></pre>

<p>Even when logged in on a VT.  The solution is to specify the framebuffer device, which should be:</p>

<pre><code>fbi -d /dev/fb0 [...]
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using ssh, try:</p>

<pre><code>fbi -T 1 [...]
</code></pre>

<p>Where ""1"" is the number of your current VT (""virtual terminal"", aka. VC, ""virtual console""; these are accessed via <code>ctrl-alt-F[1-6]</code>).  You do not have to be logged in on the VT where the image will be displayed, so you can log in remotely and use this to put images on a display attached to the pi (presuming the correct VT is on screen). <code>-T</code> is not in the man page, but it is listed with <code>fbi --help</code>.</p>

<p>Note <strong>you cannot use this to view the image on a remote terminal;</strong> those aren't associated with the framebuffer.</p>

<p>A couple of other useful options are <code>-a</code>, which will zoom the images to fit on the screen if they are too large, and <code>--edit</code>, which allows you to rotate images (I believe they are then saved with that rotation, you may want to check that if it presents an issue).    </p>

<p>I am eager to get compiling and I would like to use the latest and the best tools.</p>
","<p>I found these instructions <a href=""http://www.bootc.net/archives/2012/05/26/how-to-build-a-cross-compiler-for-your-raspberry-pi/"">How to build a cross compiler for your Raspberry Pi</a>.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> The following packages are required:<strong>bison</strong>, <strong>flex</strong>, <strong>gperf</strong>, <strong>gawk</strong>, <strong>libtool</strong>, <strong>automake</strong>, <strong>g++</strong>, ensure these are installed before proceeding.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>First download <code>crosstool-ng</code> from <a href=""http://crosstool-ng.org/"">here</a> (I used version 1.15.2).</li>
<li>Unpack the distribution and do a <code>./configure</code> / <code>make</code> / <code>install</code></li>
<li>Create a fresh directory somewhere in the file-system to build in and <code>cd</code> into it.</li>
<li>Run <code>ct-ng menuconfig</code>. You will be presented with a nice set of menus to configure your build.</li>
<li>Go into <em>Paths and misc options.</em> Enable <em>Try features marked as EXPERIMENTAL.</em></li>
<li><p>Choose a suitable <em>Prefix directory</em>. This is the directory that your compiler and libraries will get installed in (anything is fine basicallly, just make sure that the directory is empty).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>NOTE:</strong> It is also important that you have write access to the chosen folder</em> </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Go to the <em>Target options</em> menu. </p>

<ul>
<li>Target architecture: <strong>arm</strong></li>
<li>Endianness: <strong>little endian</strong></li>
<li>Bitness: <strong>32-bit</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You may also want to set floating point parameter to <strong>softfp</strong> (see <a href=""http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/Linux-For-Devices-Articles/Why-ARMs-EABI-matters/"">this</a> for more info), but <em>hardfp</em> is more appropriate for Raspbian.</p></li>
<li>Go to <em>Operating system</em> menu and change <em>Target OS</em> to <strong>linux</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to <em>C compiler</em> menu and choose gcc version 4.7.0 (the article recommends Linaro, but I managed to get it working with vanilla gcc). Also chose additional languages you want to be able to compile (C++, Fortran, ...) </li>
<li><p>Go to <em>C-library</em> menu and chose one. The default is <strong>eglibc</strong> but that one didn't build fine for me, so I used <strong>glibc</strong> (the newest version).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>NOTE:</strong> during the build step 13. <strong>eglibc</strong> can fail to build if subversion is not installed, as the source can't be retrieved from the repository</em></li>
<li><strong><em>NOTE:</strong> <strong>eglibc</strong> is no longer a part of <code>crosstool-ng</code> as of version 1.21.0 due to its lack of development. See <a href=""https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng/pull/37"">So long to eglibc</a>. Use <strong>glibc</strong> as default.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Exit the configuration tool while saving your changes.</li>
<li>Run <code>ct-ng build</code> in the same directory. Wait a while (about 45 minutes in my case) and your cross compiler should be ready.</li>

<p>Is there anything that a RPI can do that is limited in a cluster? For instance, will I still have control over all individual GPIO ports?</p>

<p>How much faster does it make the pi? Lets say I make a 2 node cluster, over clocked to 1GHz each, will I essentially have a ""dual core 1GHz"" processor? Does the cluster need to be in Binary multiples? (ex. 1,2,4,8,16,32,64)</p>

<p>Will this complicate my web hosting running via NGINX for pi? Can the processing power of certain nodes be assigned specific tasks they handle? Such as node 1 will handle web service requests, Node 2 handles cloud storage, etc..</p>
","<p>Some interesting questions. I think you may be slightly misunderstanding how the ""supercomputers"" built with Raspberry Pis work. They do not function as an automatic load sharing system. They are designed for something called <em>parallel programming</em>, where a complex task is broken down into pieces that can be performed simultaneously. The main Pi in the cluster (head node) is in charge of organizing the overall task, and each Pi in the cluster (client nodes) performs its allocated work and reports results back to the head node. Libraries such as <a href=""http://www.open-mpi.org/"">OpenMPI</a> are key for this.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Raspberry Pi clusters that have been built haven't been built as efficient computing devices. They have been built as <em>development platforms</em>. It's significantly cheaper to buy 32 Raspberry Pis than 32 desktop PCs. You can develop and test your parallel programming software much cheaper that way. The only alternative if you don't have the Pis or PCs is to request CPU time on an actual super computer. Depending on the size of the computer in question, doing so can cost money or have long wait times before the resources are available. Hence why people have built their own personal clusters. It only makes sense to run your application on the real computer when you'll know it works!</p>

<p>So, keeping this in mind and moving on to your specific questions.</p>

<p>In a proper cluster Pis do not act as a single virtual computer. You have loose control over each Pi in the form of a task or resource allocation system like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine"">Sun Grid Engine</a>. Tasks are allocated out to nodes as needed, and when the tasks are finished the resources of that node are freed up for new tasks.</p>

<p>In a cluster, since each Pi is running its own copy of Linux, each Pi would retain local control of its GPIO ports. I'm not sure how software would really use that in a parallel computing environment, but there you are.</p>

<p>A cluster doesn't really make a Pi faster, because they're not a single computer. What a you gain is simply the ability to do more at once. You're not limited to multiples of two. There is however a real practical upper limit to clustered computers depending on the tasks you run. Imagine if you're running a parallel calculation on many Pis that requires 200 steps. However, each next step requires the information that every Pi calculated on its previous step. So each Pi needs to receive data from every other Pi each iteration. Depending on the amount of time each iteration takes to calculate, you can end up spending more time sending data around than calculating. This is why most super computers use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiniband"">InfiniBand</a> network. It's very fast, so you can do more calculating. The solution to this is to use fewer Pis but have them do more work each iteration, but that may not be possible depending on your algorithm. Hence the practical upper limit. (On Pis this would be particularly bad because the USB Ethernet is quite slow.)</p>

<p>So, on to a practical application, distributed web-hosting! You can take advantage of multiple Pis here, it's just not a regular cluster. Say you have 5 Pis. We'll call them GatewayPi, WebPi1, WebPi2, WebPi3, and DataPi. GatewayPi faces the internet, running Nginix to handle web requests, but doesn't do any processing. Instead what it does is <a href=""https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-nginx-load-balancing"">Load balancing</a>. It uses proxying and randomly forwards the incoming request to WebPi1, WebPi2, or WebPi3. We've just tripled the power of our web infrastructure, because we can now handle more requests simultaneously. What about DataPi? DataPi has attached a hard drive storing all our web-data and is running an NFS server. WebPiX mounts that NFS share so it has access to the data for processing. This way we only have to run backups in one location and can save on disk space.</p>

<p>What I've just described is essentially the model that large companies like Google and Facebook use, but scaled down to Raspberry Pi size. The only catch is, because of the costs of Pis, that doing this is essentially creating the same development platform (but for webserving) as a cluster of Pis is for parallel programming. Using multiple Pis, because of their relatively low computational ability soon looses out in performance to energy consumption as you head towards handling large amounts of data. But for just learning? They're perfect.</p>

"How does Raspberry Pi boot?","48066","","<p>I have a raspberry mini computer and I am wondering how that thing does whole the boot process. I can compile my own kernel and init ramdisk with my own scripts and build my own minimal linux system on PC, but for that I need to use some bootloader. Raspberry doesn't seem to support bootloaders at all.</p>

<p>It seems to somehow boot up using its GPU which reads some partition on SD card (probably that one with bootable flag) that needs to be formatted in FAT32, then it reads some files from there, which are provided, for example by raspbian.</p>

<p>But how would I boot up my own kernel, with my own customizations that I compiled myself? Where should I copy the kernel image / initrd (ram disk) so that raspberry find it and boot from it? I am basically looking for some very detailed technical documentation that describes the boot process on raspberry or just some explanation of this.</p>
","<p>From this <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=6685"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raspberry Pi forum post</a> <em>[Edited to reflect <code>loader.bin</code> as an anachronism]</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>When the Raspberry Pi is first turned on, the ARM core is off, and
  the GPU core is on. At this point the SDRAM is disabled.</li>
  <li>The GPU starts executing the first stage bootloader, which is stored
  in ROM on the SoC. The first stage bootloader reads the SD card, and
  loads the second stage bootloader (<code>bootcode.bin</code>) into the L2 cache,
  and runs it.</li>
  <li><code>bootcode.bin</code> enables SDRAM, and reads the third stage bootloader
  (loader.bin) from the SD card into RAM, and runs it.  <strong>[ More recent versions do not use a third stage bootloader. ]</strong></li>
  <li>[ If applicable ]<code>loader.bin</code> reads the GPU firmware (<code>start.elf</code>).</li>
  <li><code>start.elf</code> reads <code>config.txt</code>, <code>cmdline.txt</code> and <code>kernel.img</code></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><code>loader.bin</code> doesn't do much. It can handle <code>.elf</code> files, and so is needed
  to load <code>start.elf</code> at the top of memory (ARM uses SDRAM from address
  zero). There is a plan to add elf loading support to <code>bootcode.bin</code>,
  which would make <code>loader.bin</code> unnecessary, but it's a low priority (I
  guess it might save you 100ms on boot). <em>[ This change has since taken place. ]</em></p>

","<p>CEA modes are intended for TV, they include plenty of interlaced and progressive modes, usually with 25/50/100Hz (PAL) or 30/60/120Hz (NTSC) frame rates and TV resolutions of 288/480/576/720/1080 scan lines. DMT modes are intended for computer monitors, therefore there are none of the interlaced modes, the resolutions are 640/720/800/1024/1280 and the frame rates are compatible with the computer monitors, something like 60/70/75/80/85/120Hz.</p>

"How to install GNU C++ Development Tools on Raspberry Pi (using apt-get)","45380","","<p>Is there a well-known package I should install for C++ Development Tools? </p>

<p>What do I type at the command-line after <code>sudo apt-get install</code>? </p>

<p>Ideally, I want the same tools that were installed with ""MinGW"" on my Windows computer.</p>
","<p>That may depend on your distro, but if you are using raspbian, the stock gcc includes g++, here's the version info:</p>

<pre><code>me@RPi» gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
[...]
--enable-languages=c,c++,fortran,objc,obj-c++ 
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>apt-get install gcc</code> should work if it isn't already there.</p>

<p>Most distros will build gcc with C++ support, so this should be true for them too.  The easy way to check is to install gcc then try <code>g++ -v</code>.</p>

<p>FYI, GCC is the ""Gnu Compiler Collection"" used by MinGW; <code>gcc</code> is the C compiler, <code>g++</code> is C++.</p>

<p>To compile C++ code you'll also need the stdc++ header files (<code>#includes</code>) from the ""libstdc++ dev package"".  There is more than one available for raspbian because there are 4 slightly different versions of libstdc++ available.  The one which appears to be the default against which (presumably) all or most binaries in the distro are built looks to me to be 6-4.6.  Check with:</p>

<pre><code>dpkg -l | grep ++
</code></pre>

<p>That's what is currently installed.  If you don't see any libstdc++ listed, then just pick one from what's available (<code>apt-cache search libstdc++</code>).  You can have them all installed at the same time, although the system will tend to use only one (there is a symlink based on major version in /lib to <em>one</em> of the .so's).  So:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install libstdc++6-4.6-dev
</code></pre>

<p>That <em>should</em> (I think) include the base library as a prereq, in which case that and gcc and its prereqs should cover everything.  If it doesn't, just install <code>libstdc++6-4.6</code>.  Library packages in most linux distros come in two parts, the runtime, and the headers in a separate <code>-dev</code> package for compiling using the API.</p>

<p>Obviously you can <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_cycling"">power cycle</a>, but is there a more subtle way, like a reset pin? It would be very useful to connect a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer"">watchdog</a> in case the Raspberry Pi crashes (mine crashed last night).</p>

<p>EDIT:
The <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1929"">rev 2.0 board</a> has a header you can connect a reset switch to.</p>
","<p>You can use the BCM2708's hardware watchdog. </p>

<p>To use it begin by loading the module:</p>

<pre><code>sudo modprobe bcm2708_wdog
</code></pre>

<p>Then edit the /etc/modules file:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/modules
</code></pre>

<p>and add the following line:</p>

<pre><code>bcm2708_wdog
</code></pre>

<p>Next you will need to setup the watchdog daemon.</p>

<p>Install and confiigure it to start on bootup:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install watchdog chkconfig
chkconfig watchdog on
sudo /etc/init.d/watchdog start
</code></pre>

<p>Next configure watchdog: </p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/watchdog.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Uncomment the line <code>#watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog</code> so it reads:</p>

<pre><code>watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog
</code></pre>

<p>The watchdog daemon will send /dev/watchdog a heartbeat every 10 seconds. If /dev/watchdog does not receive this signal it will restart your Raspberry Pi. </p>

<p>This can be useful if you are accessing your Pi remotely, and it dies or locks up. However, this is not the preferred method of restarting the system, but can be used to restart a locked system, where the only other option is to remove power from the device. Be warned that this can result in filesystem damage that could prevent the Pi from booting and operating correctly.</p>

<p>More info including a method to test this setup can be found in Gadgetoid's blog post <a href=""http://pi.gadgetoid.co.uk/post/001-who-watches-the-watcher"" rel=""noreferrer"">Who watches the watcher?</a>.

"What can I use to power my Raspberry Pi Zero with rechargeable battery?","45033","","<p>Is there a 5&nbsp;V rechargeable battery and cables compatible and comparative in size with Raspberry Pi Zero?</p>

<p>I don't want to have to plug my Raspberry Pi in every time and nonrechargables get expensive. Power banks seem so much bigger than the Zero and aren't viably wearable.</p>

<p>Update: I plan to put a bounty on this question soon, so I would like to clarify a bit more so as to fit the rules. I am not trying to ask for shopping advice, although an adafruit link would be nice. I am just wondering compatibility and what is out there. If you would like me to target a specific battery, I could reword the question as ""How can I power my Raspberry Pi Zero with a Samsung Galaxy battery"", but I thought there would be a better source. Please let me know how I can fit the rules even more. The answers given are good except many do not include the cables/connectors needed to use them.</p>
","<p>I took a quick look at some light and powerful lithium polymer batteries, and it looks to me like a battery similar in scale to the Zero is not going to provide much capacity. Let's keep in mind that the computer only weighs 9 g. A LiPo of similar size [1] contains a about 1.3 W*h of energy, which won't power the Pi Zero for a full 3 hours, even idle. [2] To use that battery (or any LiPo single cell) you'd need a wee boost converter as well, such as the PowerBoost 500 Basic. [3] (It weighs another 3 g.) </p>

<p>Frankly, I think our expectations have been knocked askew by the tiny computer -- what would our ""comparable in size"" battery have looked like a year ago? What about 5 years ago? Right, now ask yourself whether you expect batteries to somehow follow Moore's Law (or whatever outrageous improvement trend you see in silicon [4] in the last 10 years.) </p>

<p>TL;DR: Batteries can't and don't get better as fast as computers do. :) </p>

I'm doing this as I only have a laptop and no spare keyboard, screen, etc. My problem is I cannot find the boot_enable_ssh.rc file.</p>

<p>All of the tutorials I've read describe using dd (so doing this using Unix (Ubuntu)) to write the .img file to the SD card. Done like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dd bs=1M if=/path/to/2012-08-16-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdb

- 2012-08-16-wheezy-raspbian.img</p>

<p>but for both, there is no /boot/boot_enable_ssh.rc file.</p>

<p>I've also tried searching with find (<code>sudo find /media/ -name boot_enable_ssh.rc</code>). Still with no success.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong is there another way to get ssh going?</p>
","<p>Although Raspbian <em>used</em> to enable ssh by default, from December 2016 it no longer does so. While there is still no boot_enable_ssh.rc file as the OP requested in 2012, ssh can be enabled on first boot by creating a file called “ssh” in <code>/boot</code>. As <code>/boot</code> can be written to by any OS that understands SD cards, this extra step is easily done on first installation. It does not need to be done again with the same card image. You can also enable it through <code>raspi-config</code> as before.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation chose to do this as enabling ssh by default <em>and</em> having a well-known user name/password combination is a <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-security-update-for-raspbian-pixel/"">security risk</a>.</p>

","<p>If look at the <code>/etc/init.d/skeleton</code> script, in the beginning of it there are two marks : <code>### BEGIN INIT INFO</code> and <code>### END INIT INFO</code>.</p>

<p>Your script is missing these tags and configuration so <code>insserv</code> just uses some defaults. </p>

<p>This is just a warning and is not something to worry about, but you can fix it very easily and then you can be <code>Linux Standards Base</code>-compliant (That's what LSB means).</p>

If you connect an ethernet cable, the cabled network connection immediately shuts down WiFi access and eth0 then connects you to the cabled network. By unplugging the network cable the wireless connection will instantly be available again.</p>

"Raspbian moving to 64-bit mode","42999","","<p>In <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-on-sale/"">this page</a>, the official RPi3 announcement states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’ll need a recent NOOBS or Raspbian image from our downloads page. At launch, we are using the same 32-bit Raspbian userland that we use on other Raspberry Pi devices; over the next few months we will investigate whether there is value in moving to 64-bit mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is, given that the processor is 64 bits, isn't it <em>obvious</em> that running the OS in 64 bits will be better in every way? What am I missing?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>given that the processor is 64 bits, isn't it obvious that running the OS in 64 bits will be better in every way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No actually, it's not. In some ways, running a 64 bit operating system <em>could</em> deteriorate the Raspberry Pi's performance. </p>

<p><strong>Benefits of 64 bit</strong>:</p>

<p>The two primary benefits of using a 64 bit processor/operating system is that the device can handle more than 4 GB of RAM, and natively handle integers larger than <code>2^32</code> without the need for a bignum library.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi doesn't have more than 4 GB of RAM. At a 1 GB of RAM, you've completely lost the first of the two primary benefits. As for the second benefit, what percentage of people are actually using enough giant numbers that it makes sense for the foundation to support a whole second operating system?  As is, the RPi can use huge numbers through software methods, but it seems like if you're going to be consistently in that realm, you need to be using better hardware anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Problems with 64 bit</strong>:</p>

<p>The ability to store a larger number isn't granted by magic. Rather, the size of memory objects needs to be increased. In C (and C++) this means changing an <code>int</code> to <code>int64_t</code>. This isn't done automatically, hence the comments about the foundation not wanting to maintain two branches.</p>

<p>Additionally, many applications simply don't provide a benefit (for most users) when run in 64 bit mode. Notice that most web browsers, MS Office, and a whole host of other popular software is all still shipped and maintained in a 32 bit manner. Sure you can get your hands on an 64 bit release of MS Office, but it's rarely used.</p>

<p>If the application/operating system is written to take advantage of a 64 bit architecture, your application is going to use more memory, simply because variables and pointers are taking up more space. Usually this is a relatively small trade off for machines that will benefit from the perks. In our case, we have very few perks, and very little RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Also of note</strong>: </p>

<p>Just because you're running on a 64 bit machine, doesn't mean the application isn't running as 32 bit. Windows makes this very clear by having two different install paths, <code>C:\Program Files</code> and <code>C:\Program Files (x86)</code>.</p>

<p><strong>So, will the foundation likely provide 64 bit support?</strong>:</p>

<p>We're back at the same point of, ""Some people may see benefit, but most will not."".  You'll certainly see other projects offering 64 bit builds, but unless the foundation gets a lot of undeserved (imo) flack, they probably won't and shouldn't (imo). Creating and maintaining a separate 64 bit branch isn't a small endeavor, and honestly, just doesn't seem worth it.</p>

","<p>It's even lower level than what @Milliways describes, the entire card including all partition information is not erased but <strong>overwritten</strong>. It doesn't matter if the card used to be FAT32 or NTFS or ext4 or just gobbledygook from <code>/dev/random</code>, afterwards it will contain the image data in whatever partition is used.</p>

<p>Any data that is on the card <em>after</em> the size of the Raspbian disk image, will be retained BUT you'll have difficulties to access it because a) there is no more partition that contains it b) there is no more filesystem with inodes that point to the actual data.</p>

"How do I install Chrome OS?","41363","","<p>Could I get Chrome OS working on my Raspberry Pi without having to compile anything?</p>

<p>I've heard somebody has compiled it for the Raspberry Pi, so I was wondering if anyone has had any experience in doing this.</p>
","<h1>Yes, but you have to compile it.</h1>

<p>Hexxeh has been working on a build for the Raspberry Pi, as outlined in this <a href=""http://hexxeh.net/?p=328117867"">blog post</a>. The main issue with it is that it is <em>really, really, slow.</em> This is because there is no graphical acceleration.</p>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>It is recommended that you have the following things before attempting to build Chromium OS.</p>

<ol>
<li>A 64-bit build machine, running Ubuntu version 10.04 (other
 versions/distros might work, but aren't supported, you're on your own)</li>
<li>At least 4GB of RAM.</li>
<li>A fast Internet connection.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Get the Code</h1>

<p>Now you need to get the actual Chromium OS code. You can find out how to do this at the <a href=""http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-guide"">Chromium OS Developer Guide</a>.</p>

<h1>Add the Overlay</h1>

<p>Next you need to add the Raspberry Pi overlay to the source code. Find the directory named <code>overlays</code> in the <code>src</code> folder of the Chromium OS source code. Copy the overlay found in the <a href=""https://github.com/Hexxeh/overlay-raspberrypi"">Hexxeh/overlay-raspberrypi</a> Github repro.</p>

<h1>Toolchain Setup</h1>

<p>First you <strong>must</strong> be inside the Chromium OS chroot. Refer to sectoin 4.2 of the developer guide if you are not sure how to do this. Second you need to be root to build the toolchain. This can be achieved via <code>su</code> or <code>sudo -i</code>. Then run the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ USE=""-thumb -hardened hardfp"" FEATURES=""splitdebug"" crossdev -S -t armv6j-cros-linux-gnueabi --ex-gdb
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can quit root via <code>exit</code>.</p>

<h1>Board Setup</h1>

<p>You only need to run this command once.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./setup_board --board=raspberrypi
</code></pre>

<p>You'll also want to leave a backdoor for a development image to let yourself into the shell. You can do that via the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./set_shared_user_password
</code></pre>

<p>At the prompt enter the password and press enter. Tada.</p>

<h1>Building an Image</h1>

<p>First we need to make sure that we have all the required packages. We can get build these via.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./build_packages --board=raspberrypi --withdev --nowithdebug --nousepkg --nowithautotest
</code></pre>

<p>Finally! You can build a USB image via.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./build_image dev --board=raspberrypi --noenable_rootfs_verification
</code></pre>

","<p>A USB UART, such as FTDI, isn't really expensive. All your other options sound like they will cost you more in parts and time than the ~$13 it might cost you, and be unreliable or slow. Just go for the fast and trouble-free option, such as:</p>

<p>Sparkfun sells one too. In fact, maybe you can just pull one out of some old USB device or buy one from a junk store that doesn't know what it does. </p>

<p>I messed with an SPI to UART adapter for an Arduino project, there was no existing library so I wrote my own. In the end it worked ok, but if I could have just dropped in a $15 part I would have. In fact given the time it cost me I should have just got a mega with 4 serial ports. </p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your time and help. It is highly appreciated.</p>
","<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation claims unambiguously that a VGA adapter on the GPIO header ""means you can use it as a secondary monitor alongside HDMI"" (<a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/gert-vga-adapter/"" rel=""noreferrer"">from here</a>).  You should certainly be able to do that via USB; for evidence of the the pi running multi-headed, see comments below.  The exception, of course, is trying to use the HDMI and the RCA video simultaneously.  I would guess this limitation has to do with the GPU only being able to handle one output.  That USB video can't use the GPU is also an assumption but one I'm pretty sure of; the piTFT and other GPIO based touchscreens can't use it directly either.  This is actually good if you want dual heads, because it means there should be two completely separate video systems and linux takes it from there.</p>

<p>If you run two displays under X, they will probably be mirrored by default, but other arrangements can be configured easily.  I am not sure about the possibility of running X on one monitor and console framebuffer on the other, or of running two framebuffers.  Although the latter is possible it may not be applicable to all setups.</p>

"How do I control the system LEDs using my software?","39563","","<p>There are 5 LEDs on the RPi: OK, PWR, FDX, LNK, 10M.</p>

<p>I'd like to know if it's possible to control any of these from software i.e. turn them on, or change intensity (or even change colour <em>gasp</em>).</p>

<p>And if so, where can I read up about it? The LEDs could be quite handy way of signalling user application status when they are not required for the original use.</p>
","<p>The OK LED can be controlled from user space software.  Details here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3//viewtopic.php?p=136266#p136266"">http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3//viewtopic.php?p=136266#p136266</a></p>

<p>Summarised from the above (all credit to BrianW):</p>

<p>The OK LED is available as /sys/class/leds/led0/</p>

<p>The kernel LED driver has ""triggers"" which let some other part of the kernel control the LED. The default trigger for the LED is 'mmc0', which makes it come on when the SD card is accessed.</p>

<pre><code>root@raspberrypi:~# cat /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger
none [mmc0]
</code></pre>

<p>You can deactivate the mmc0 trigger as follows:</p>

<pre><code>echo none &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/trigger
</code></pre>

<p>The LED can be turned on and off using the 'brightness' file. The minimum brightness is 0, and the maximum is 255.  As there is no variable brightness support, any value greater than 0 will turn the LED on.</p>

<pre><code>echo 1 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness
echo 0 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness
</code></pre>

<p>atically sets the trigger to ""none""</p>

<p>If you want the LED to go back to its default function:</p>

<pre><code>echo mmc0 &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/trigger
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple of kernel modules you can load up (ledtrig_timer and ledtrig_heartbeat) which will flash the LED for you.</p>

<pre><code>modprobe ledtrig_heartbeat
echo heartbeat &gt;/sys/class/leds/led0/trigger
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have turned off the mmc0 trigger, you can use GPIO16 to control the LED. It's active-low, so you need to set the pin low to turn the LED on, and high to turn it off.</p>

<p>From Python, you can use the module RPi.GPIO to control pin 16.  There is also a C# driver.</p>

"PI as a VPN router for local machines","38893","","<p>I would like to enable couple of my machines to access the internet through a VPN connection. My idea is that the PI can simply dial in an establish a connection and then route requests from the other machines through it.</p>

<p>I am thinking that setting up a default router of the device to the IP of the PI.</p>

<p>While somehow experienced with command line configuration of multitude of things, could you please point to me to directions on what packages/services I need?</p>

<p>Summary of the setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>PI connecting to the internet directly through the default router</li>
<li>PI creates a VPN connection (OpenVPN) and listens on its local interface for traffic</li>
<li>PI re-establishes connection on failures</li>
<li>other network devices have default gateway set to the IP of the PI and all their traffic goes through the VPN, provided that is up (and no internet connection if the VPN is down).</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not need NAT or DHCP services (DNS can also go through the VPN).</p>
","<p>I have the same setup as you:</p>

<pre><code>Cable modem -&gt; Router (192.168.1.1) +-&gt; Raspberry Pi (192.168.1.11)
                                    |-&gt; iPad (DHCP)
                                    |-&gt; PC (DHCP)
                                    `-&gt; AppleTV (DHCP)
</code></pre>

<p>First, I changed my network settings (<code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>) on the RPi to a static address</p>

<pre><code>iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.11
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.1.0
broadcast 192.168.1.255
gateway 192.168.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>After that, you need to setup the OpenVPN on the RPi:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install openvpn
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you have to set the config file for the vpn <code>/etc/openvpn/server.conf</code>. I used the sample provided by my vpn service (Witopia) and change <code>dev tun</code> to <code>dev tun0</code> and added <code>redirect-gateway</code> at the end.</p>

<p>Next step, modify iptables to allow NAT</p>

<pre><code>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
</code></pre>

<p>To make it permanent, save it like this</p>

<pre><code>sudo bash
iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables.up.rules
nano /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables
</code></pre>

<p>Add this to the new file:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
/sbin/iptables-restore &lt; /etc/iptables.up.rules
</code></pre>

<p>Save and make it executable with <code>chmod +x /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables</code>. You now need to enable IP forwarding by editing <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and uncomment the line <code>net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1</code></p>

<p>Reboot and the RPi should be connecting to your VPN and be ready to receive incoming traffic. I added a new option to my dhcp service on my router (running OpenWrt) to specify the gateway sent to the client. I added the line <code>list 'dhcp_option' '3,192.168.1.11'</code> to the file <code>/etc/config/dhcp</code> and rebooted the router. My iPad, PC and AppleTV now connect through the RPi to access external urls.</p>

"iOS on a Raspberry Pi","38721","","<p>Now, I understand it would probably be impractical to do so, but for the ""because I can"" reason I'd like to try to install iOS on my Raspberry Pi. (when it eventually comes..)</p>

<p>I've looked around for <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=9800"">posts</a> on this matter, and they seem to suggest that running iOS 3 may be possible due to hardware constraints, but how hard could this really be? Years ago I set up a couple of OS X86 machines, and although a pain ended up being total possible. (obviously)</p>

<p>So my overall question is, what should I look into doing/learning to try to install iOS on a Raspberry Pi?</p>
","<p>Though Apple's iOS is attractive for users, if you are an enthusiast (as you must be having the Raspberry Pi) or a developer, then iOS is the least friendly for you.</p>

<p>iOS is compiled specifically for each model of the Apple's iPad or iPhone with specific integration of hardware and software for the platform. Essentially all the software is one giant binary blob. Someone did mention in the comments that there are many hardware similarities between the Raspberry Pi and some models of the iPhone. Your biggest hope for getting iOS to run on Raspberry Pi would be to find a firmware image for a phone whose hardware is most similar to the Raspberry Pi and then try to get it to run. Like most platform specific compiled images, however, it is likely that even slight deviations in the running environment from the expected environment will produce an unbootable system. If that ends up being the case, then most likely you will have to resort to reverse engineering and hacking the binary blob with different hardware drivers or configurations. Such may be very non-trivial and would prove challenging even to a team of competent and experienced engineers.</p>

<p>As such a very extensive knowledge of the specific hardware of different models of the iPhone as well as very good knowledge of the low level boot up process that both the Raspberry Pi and iOS use will be necessary. Additionally, look into the architecture of iOS which, as I understand, is vaguely based on the Darwin system. For this, you could look into the different jailbreaking methods and how they work.</p>

<p>Also worth noting, the legality of such actions are questionable since there are likely multiple violations of the EULA, the most obvious of which is the stipulation that Apple's operating system only run on Apple hardware. Jailbreaking is technically legal, but reverse engineering is only sometimes protected under the law and it has never been really consistently applied. The Cydia project and many of the apps that are on it are able to do some fine tuned customization for iOS. The knowledge on how to do that may overlap with the knowledge on getting it running on Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>That said, I have seen some amazing and difficult projects come about because a community of dedicated developers and hackers came together in a common goal, for example the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Linux"">Xbox-Linux project</a>, or as you pointed out, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86"">OSx86 project</a>. It is certainly not impossible to run iOS on the Raspberry Pi, but what is possible is not always practical. You may have more fun and less hassle with Android, being that it is open source. That said, where there is a strong will there is a way.</p>

<p>Which is right, or are both - why? Specially, if there are inconsistencies in datasheets for both, which shall be understood as ""more important""?</p>
","<p>Actually the discrepancy is due to the designation of the silicon and the chip package.  Originally there was the silicon die which is known as BCM2708, all initial development was done around this.</p>

"Recommended GUI toolkit for Python development on the Raspberry Pi","37561","","<p>I am teaching my daughter Python (and myself to some degree) using the Pi, and we have had a great time so far - but the CLI can only take us so far. I have started looking at other toolkits, specifically <a href=""http://wxpython.org/"">wx</a>, <a href=""http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:QtonPi"">Qt</a> and <a href=""http://www.pygtk.org/"">GTK</a>. These all seem to have great bindings for Linux in general, though I am not able to find a lot of info specific to the Raspberry Pi. I am open to other toolkits as well - as long as the python bindings are good.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience coding to one of these on the pi? Is there a simple <code>apt-get</code> command I need to run to install the necessary packages? Better yet, is there a toolkit ready to go with the stock Raspbian image?</p>

","<p>I would recommend Tkinter, it is the standard GUI library for Python, and as a result is already installed.

"Raspberry Pi with boots up with Rainbow screen","37426","","<p>How can I fix a Raspberry Pi with Rainbow screen on boot up? I have good voltage coming in and I believe I've formatted and setup the SD card properly. I have two of these boards that do the same thing; I bought them months ago but I am only getting to them now. I bought them off of Amazon and It's way to late to return or exchange them I've been told. </p>
","<p>Do you mean a screen like this?:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i39.tinypic.com/8vrlhc.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">debug screen from elinux pic http://i39.tinypic.com/8vrlhc.jpg</a></p>

<p>Various torubleshooting methods can be found <a href=""http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Coloured_splash_screen"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With current firmware, a coloured splash screen (actually its just
  four pixels ""blown up"" by the GPU to full screen) is displayed after
  GPU firmware (<code>start.elf</code>) is loaded. This should be replaced by linux
  console a second later. However if the coloured screen remains, it
  suggests the <code>kernel.img</code> file is failing to boot. Try replacing it with
  a known good one.<br></p>
  
  <p>Immediately after displaying the splash screen, the PI starts
  consuming a little more current. If the PI resets at that moment, it
  is an indication that the power supply isn't able to deliver the full
  current your PI requires, but dips its output voltage below a minimum
  when loaded with the full current the PI needs.</p>
  
  <p>In some cases (Stuck on the Rainbow Screen), freezing at this point
  has been fixed by adding <code>boot_delay=1</code> to the <code>config.txt</code> file. This
  can be done from a Windows PC, which should show several files in the
  FAT partition on your SD card including <code>bootcode.bin</code>, <code>kernel.img</code>, and
  <code>config.txt</code>. You can open <code>config.txt</code> in wordpad or any text editor. Add
  <code>boot_delay=1</code> and save the file. Don't forget to 'eject' the card
  before removing it from the card reader. If you are reading the SD card
  from a working Pi, you can edit the file with s<code>udo nano
  /boot/config.txt</code></p>
  
  <h1>Kernel Panic on boot</h1>
  
  <p>Text appears on screen, but then hangs with debug messages. This can
  be caused by USB devices such as keyboards. Try again with nothing in
  the USB. Raspberry Pi shuts down (or restarts) soon after booting up</p>
  
  <p>This is caused by a power supply producing too low a voltage. See <a href=""http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Troubleshooting_power_problems"" rel=""noreferrer"">Troubleshooting power problems</a></p>
  
  <h1>Pi boots sometimes but not always</h1>
  
  <p>With a known good power supply and known good SD card, the R-Pi boots
  occasionally, but other times shows only a tiny green flicker from the
  ""OK"" LED and it fails to start, even with no USB devices and no
  Ethernet. This has been reported several times<sub><a href=""http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#cite_note-4"" rel=""noreferrer"">[4] [5] [6]</a></sub> and remains
  an open issue. Low voltage or an improper SD card can cause it. Some
  SD cards will work until they warm up slightly, and then fail<sub><a href=""http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#cite_note-7"" rel=""noreferrer"">[7]</a></sub>. When exposed to 21 C room temperature the warmest part of an uncased working R-Pi should be 41 C<sub><a href=""http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#cite_note-8"" rel=""noreferrer"">[8]</a></sub>. The wiki has a list of working SD
  cards. Buy from a reliable vendor as it has been claimed that 1/3 of
  all ""Sandisk"" labelled memory cards are counterfeit.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>It could be that the SD memory card is not making proper contact with the Raspberry Pi. Look at the SD card holder on the Raspberry Pi
  carefully. At first glance it may look fine, but the contacts must be
  springy and they must protrude at least 2mm as measured from the lower
  edge of the holder to the top of the contact bulge. Variations happen
  due to the solder process and the type of holder used. Some of the
  solder residue falls into the contact cavity, restricting the
  springiness and the height that the contact protrudes. You can fix
  this yourself, but remember you can void your warranty. The contacts
  are delicate, so be careful. Insert a needle pin under the contact
  bulge and pull lightly up until the one end of the contact unclips.
  Clean the cavity where the contact unclipped from any solder or other
  residue by blowing into the cavity. Clip the contact back into the
  cavity by lightly pushing it into the cavity. Do this for all the
  contacts. Refer to these photos: <a href=""http://elinux.org/images/4/46/SDcardHolder.JPG"" rel=""noreferrer"">Media:SDcardHolder.JPG</a>,

<p>From what's on the SD card, how can I make an image similar in size?</p>

<p>(I'm on Ubuntu.)</p>
","<p>You mention in a comment to RooTer that A) you have reduced the initial partition size with <code>gparted</code>, but <code>dd</code> still copies the whole card, and B) that you want to include both partitions in the image. </p>

<p>Issue ""A"" is easy to explain: you are still copying the whole card because that's what <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code> refers to.  The individual partitions are of course <code>/dev/mmcblk0p1</code> and <code>/dev/mmcblk0p2</code>.  This is the complication in issue 
""B"", but you cannot simply <code>dd</code> each partition and concatenate the two files together, because of the partition table at the beginning of <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>  which indexes the beginning and length of each partition.  Without that, the image will be unusable.</p>

<p>However, you can get the length of each partition from <code>fdisk -l</code>, and use that to determine some parameters for <code>dd</code>.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk0

Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 16.1 GB, 16138633216 bytes
4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 492512 cylinders, total 31520768 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x00017b69

Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/mmcblk0p1    8192      122879       57344    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
/dev/mmcblk0p2  122880    26746879    13312000   83  Linux
</code></pre>

<p>The ""Start"" and ""End"" units are sectors, and notice the sector size is given, 512 bytes.  For <code>/dev/mmcblk0p2</code>, 26746879 (the last sector) - 122880 (the first sector) = 26623999 / 2 (for 2 sectors per kB) / 1024 (kB per MB) / 1024 (MB per GB) = 12.69, which I grew the partition using gparted to 12 GB, so this looks correct (really I should be using 1000 and not 1024 as the divisor with storage, which works out to 13.31 GB, but I suspect gparted and some other tools also use 1024).</p>

<p>So the first thing you want to check is that your second partition is really the smaller size that you set it to.  Next, just use those numbers with <code>dd</code>; for me it would be:</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=rpi.img bs=512 count=26746880
</code></pre>

<p>I've got an extra sector there to avoid any kind of off by one misunderstanding of how <code>dd</code> works.  There's a simple way to check if this worked:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; fdisk -l rpi.img

Disk rpi.img: 102 MB, 102400000 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 12 cylinders, total 200000 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x00017b69

Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
rpi.img1          8192      122879       57344    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
rpi.img2        122880    26746879    13312000   83  Linux
</code></pre>

<p>Notice there is a bit of a discrepancy here: the ""Start"" and ""End"" sectors match the original partition table, but the total size in the stats up top is only 102 MB!  This is because I actually used <code>count=200000</code> as the param to <code>dd</code> because I did not really want to bother with a 12 GB copy (notice also ""total 200000 sectors"").  The reason the table at the bottom does not reflect this is because fdisk is getting its information from the partition data copied verbatim at the beginning of the image from the beginning of the SD card, which, as I mentioned in the second paragraph, is vital to maintain.  If I had (properly) copied the rest, the numbers would be copacetic and the image would be viable.</p>

<p>Give that a try. :)</p>

"How can I mount a Raspberry Pi Linux distro image?","37190","","<p>Normal filesystem images can be easily mounted:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Examined, and modified.  But when I try this with a Raspberry Pi system image (e.g. raspbian), I get:</p>

<pre><code>mount: unknown filesystem type '(null)'
</code></pre>

<p>And no matter what I try with <code>-t</code>, it won't work.  How can I mount this image?</p>
","<p>This question is answered as part of the answer to other questions, but it deserves canonical treatment here so it does not have to keep being repeated.</p>

<p>You can't mount the image as a whole because it actually contains two partitions and a boot sector.  However, you can mount the individual partitions in the image if you know their offset inside the file.  To find them, examine the image as a block device with <code>fdisk -l whatever.img</code>.  The output should include a table like this:</p>

<pre><code>Device         Boot     Start       End  Blocks  Id System
whatever.img1            8192    122879   57344   c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
whatever.img2          122880   5785599 2831360  83 Linux
</code></pre>

<p>These are the two partitions.  The first one is labelled ""FAT32"", and the other one ""Linux"". Above this table, there's some other information about the device as a whole, including:</p>

<pre><code>Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
</code></pre>

<p>We can find the offset in bytes by multiplying this unit size by the <code>Start</code> block of the partition:</p>

<ul>
<li>1st partition 512 * 8192 = 4194304</li>
<li>2nd partition 512 * 122880 = 62914560</li>
</ul>

<p>These can be used with the <code>offset</code> option of the <code>mount</code> command.  We also have a clue about the <em>type</em> of each partition from <code>fdisk</code>.  So, presuming we have directories <code>/mnt/img/one</code> and <code>/mnt/img/two</code> available as mount points:</p>

<pre><code>mount -v -o offset=4194304 -t vfat whatever.img /mnt/img/one
mount -v -o offset=62914560 -t ext4 whatever.img /mnt/img/two
</code></pre>

<p>If you get an ""overlapping loop"" error here, your version of <code>mount</code> requires you to specify the size as well as the offset of the first partition.  Unmount that, and use the number of blocks (57344) * 512 (= 29360128):</p>

<pre><code>mount -v -o offset=4194304,sizelimit=29360128 \
    -t vfat whatever.img /mnt/img/one  
</code></pre>

<p>The second partition doesn't need a sizelimit since there's nothing after it in the image.    </p>

<p>You can now access the two partitions.  If you do not intend to change anything in them, use the <code>-r</code> (read-only) switch too.  <strong>If you do change anything, those changes will be included in the <code>.img</code> file.</strong></p>

"How to improve boot time for Raspberry Pi?","36563","","<p>I'm creating an embeddable remote application that won't be permanently switched on.

read speeds. I'm not fixed to any particular distribution, so I can strip down as much as neccessary to use a minimal Linux distribution. </p>

<p>(I've attempted to look for benchmarks that people have ran to improve boot time, but I haven't found anything with hard figures.)</p>

<p>I could also use <a href=""http://buildroot.uclibc.org/about.html"">build root</a> (see also YouTube video <em><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fjfqz6FxC8"">Raspberry Pi - Super Fast Boot Time - Marshmallow Entertainment System</a></em>)...</p>
","<p>If you combine Arch Linux with the features that Fred suggested, you should get a generally fast booting OS.</p>

<p>What slows down OS' boot-times is </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Slow read/write (I/O) speeds. </p>

<p>So you using a faster SD card <em>will</em> help, <strike>a Class 10 card will be substantially faster than a Class 4 card</strike>. I misunderstood how SD card classes worked, and that has been pointed out quite clearly in the comments, my bad. Actually, a Class 10 card will be faster than a Class 4 card <em>for large file transfers</em> such as HD video and whatnot. Apparently Class 4 performs just as well with smaller files. Again, my bad, but hey, we all learn now and again.</p></li>
<li><p>A bogged-down init sequence. </p>

<p>If you have lots of software that fires up during the boot phase, the boot-time is going to be slower. More software starting == Longer boot time. </p>

<p>Thus, if you need a fast boot, cut as much software from the init sequence as possible. You can create a simple script (or I'm sure there is one out there) that will launch software <em>after</em> the main boot sequence completes, spreading the load out a bit more.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That's basically it. Arch Linux is probably the way to go, combined with the features Fred mentioned, as I said before. Arch is a <em>very</em> minimal OS and may not be the best thing for a beginner to use, but if you have experience in Linux, then go for it. It just takes a bit of setting up, as it comes with the bare minimum to install and <em>that's it</em>.</p>

<p>I know that one answer is that it should not matter because air cooling is sufficient. However, this is for a situation where air flow in the enclosure is very limited (and the SoC and ethernet controllers are not necessarily the primary heat sources.)</p>

"Raspberry Pi 2 - Are 64GB UHS-I Class 1 SDXC cards supported?","35708","","<p>Raspberry Pi 2 - Are 64GB UHS SDXC cards supported?</p>

<p>I'm using a 64GB Hama UHS-I SDXC card formatted with the SD Card Formatter 4.0 with NOOBS 1.4 on it. It doesn't seem to want to boot. I have both green and red lights on all the time. Monitor doesn't come on...</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
","<p>The answer is ""Yes"" they are supported.</p>

<p>Apparently SD Card Formatter goes in and formats the card as ExFAT instead of FAT32 by default, because of its huge size. To get around this, on a mac for example, open Disk Utility, select the card and Partition it in two, formatting both halves as FAT32.</p>

<p>Then go round and copy the contents of NOOBS folder (unzipped NOOBS package) to the first partition of the SD Card.</p>

<p>Go ahead and put it in. It should start now, give it a couple of tries.
The Pi 2 is very fast using this Hama card (does about 80mb/s read, and 20mb/s write with a reasonable iops, it feels like a snappy hdd) The actual setup, installing Raspbian took a little over 6 minutes. Wow!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The first time it starts NOOBS will actually automagically resize the two partitions back into one for you. Voila... a FAT32 64GB card running on a Raspberry Pi 2 (this will work I think on the Raspberry Pi 1 too, but I don't have one to test) </p>

<p>Managed to figure it out in the end thanks to @goldilocks bumping me in the right direction with ""green light constantly on indicates an SD card was found but it does not seem to be in the right format"".</p>

"""cannot open display"" with PuTTY","35646","","<p>I am controlling my PI through my PC (wich is running Windows 7) using Putty to type in commands and tightvnc viewer to access the GUI.</p>

<p>I can launch programs with the TightVNC viewer GUI or TightVNC viewer LXterminal. However if I try to launch them on the command line with the putty shell I get an error.</p>

<p>Eg. if I type: <code>midori</code>
I will get:
<code>Midori - cannot open display</code></p>

<p>I have read up about X, etc... but can't figure out what to do.</p>

<p>(When I type: <code>echo $DISPLAY</code>, I get a blank line, in case this is any help).</p>
","<p>To access an UNIX server from a Windows client, my preferred combination is <strong><a href=""http://www.putty.org/"">PuTTY</a> + <a href=""http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/"">Xming</a></strong>. Xming is <strong>easy to install</strong>, <strong>lightweight</strong>, <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>stable</strong>, and works pretty well overall.</p>

<p>The procedure (<a href=""http://solaris.reys.net/how-to-x11-forwarding-using-ssh-putty-and-xming/"">also explained here</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Enable the X11 forwarding option</strong> in PuTTY (Configuration > Connection > SSH > X11 > Enable X11 forwarding)</li>
<li><strong>Start Xming</strong> on your Windows machine: <code>...\Xming\Xming.exe :0 -clipboard -multiwindow</code></li>
<li><strong>Connect</strong> to your Raspberry PI with PuTTY</li>
<li><strong>Launch</strong> any X application from your PuTTY ssh console</li>
</ul>

<p>The application should appear on it's own window (if you set the <code>-multiwindow</code> Xming command-line option), and seamlessly integrate onto the host.</p>

<p>The nice thing is that it's rather lightweight, you do not need to run a full-blown X desktop on the Raspberry. With a decent network connection between the client and the host you do not feel any lag. And remember that <em>client</em> and <em>host</em> are swapped from their usual understanding according to X11 conventions!</p>

<p><em>Note 1</em>: I don't know anything about TightVNC, but simply activating X11 forwarding in PuTTY should be enough to make that work with any X server on your Windows machine. But again, Xming rocks!</p>

<p><em>Note 2</em>: There is even a documentation on using PuTTY on <a href=""http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/trouble.php"">Xming website</a>.</p>

"Multiple temperature sensors with a Raspberry Pi","35517","","<p>I have seen plenty of examples for using one temperature sensor with the Raspberry Pi, however, how can I multiplex 5-6 temperature sensors to a Raspberry Pi? I want to read the temperature from several sources simultaneously. </p>

<p>Can I simply assign the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi to read from each sensor, essentially replicating the same configuration for one sensor, or do I need some kind of multiplexor that all the sensors would plug into then in turn that would send data in parallel to the Raspberry Pi?</p>
","<p>Given that your sensor is a DS18B20, and it is a 1-wire circuit and that 1-wire is a protocol that can do multiple adressing on that same bus and that the 1-wire temperature kernel module can read as many as 10 temperature sensors on the same bus. (check line 49 of the <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-3.6.y/drivers/w1/w1.c"">driver source code</a>). </p>

<p>If you just connect 10 of your sensors to the same 3 pins (3v3, GND and the 1-wire IO pin - which is pin number 4 on the connector (this is hardcoded in the driver!) and you will read their outputs from /sys/bus/w1/devices/28*/w1_slave where the 28* is the individual unique 1-wire address. Check adafruit's <a href=""http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing/hardware"">excellent tutorial</a>. Don't forget the 4K7 resistor pulling up the data pin (number 4 - ONLY ONE!), as the internal pull up of the Pi gives you roughly 50K, and that is too much for the sensor, so you will need this extra component.</p>

<p>You should just make sure you are not trying to use parasitic power. If you connect the 3 pins of all the devices, you should be fine. </p>

<li><p><a href=""http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/download/"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Pocketsphinx</strong></a> - A version of Sphinx that can be used in
embedded systems (e.g., based on an ARM processor).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Under active development and incorporates features such as fixed-point arithmetic and efficient algorithms for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model"" rel=""noreferrer"">GMM</a> computation.  All the processing takes place on the Raspberry Pi, so it is capable of being used offline.  It supports real time speech recognition</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cons</strong>: It is complicated to set up and understand for beginners.  For me, it was too inaccurate for my application.  All the processing takes place on the Raspberry Pi, making it a bit slower.</p></li>

$ tar -zxvf sphinxbase-0.8.tar.gz; rm -rf sphinxbase-0.8.tar.gz
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To compile these packages, you'll need to install <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_bison"" rel=""noreferrer"">bison</a> and the ALSA development headers. </p>

<p><em>NOTE</em>: It is important that the ALSA headers be installed before you build Sphinxbase. Otherwise, Sphinxbase will not use ALSA. It also appears that ALSA will not be used if <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PulseAudio"" rel=""noreferrer"">PulseAudio</a> is installed (a bad thing for developers like me).</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install bison libasound2-dev

"how to disable raspberry pi power management?","35074","","<p>I am using my raspberry pi as a headless server. The problem is that after a couple of hours of inactivity it seems to enter a power suspend state where it disappears from the web and refuses ssh connections. After having prodded it via ssh it comes back after a couple of minuttes and uptime informs that it has been alive all the while. This makes me think it is some kind of power management scheme that is in effect but I have read other places that the pi is not able to suspend. </p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea what is wrong?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>After having spent a great deal of time trying to figure this out it seems a number smaller issues have helped:</p>

<ol>
<li>Configure postfix to not use ipv6.</li>
<li>Use fail2ban to blacklist ssh login attempts.</li>
<li>Update firmware on router.</li>
</ol>

<p>All three items seems to have had a positive effect on the pi's uptime. It is now reasonably stable and I have not the login-problem for about three weeks.</p>
","<p>The raspberry pi hardware has <strong>no power management capability</strong>.  Period.  End of story.  It does not have a sleep or suspend mode.  It cannot not even be turned off.  There's either power (plugged in), or there isn't (not plugged in).</p>

<p>When you shutdown the system, the software stops, meaning there is now no way to get it to do anything again.  However, the ""power state"" of the hardware is still the same (because it only has one state, on).</p>

<p>So whatever your problem is, that is not it.  You may want to look at your logs to see if anything else has been going on during the network downtime -- eg, (I'm speculating), if you have stuff attached to the usb ports that is near the limits of the pi's 150 mA output, that thing may intermittently fail, and if it's a wifi dongle, the system will then have to wait until the interface reappears.   You'd see lots of evidence that in <code>/var/log/syslog</code> or <code>/var/log/messages</code>.</p>

<p>If it's any consolation, I use the pi headless on a WLAN and don't turn it off very often, and it's been pretty flawless.  I use <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4120/how-to-automatically-reconnect-wifi/5121#5121"">this methodology</a> to ensure the connection stays up; peeking at the current log, it's had to reconnect itself only twice in the past 48 hours.  However, I make pretty light use of it too, maybe occasionally there is a big download, etc., but not constant traffic (the more it's accessed the more opportunities there are for something to fail, so I can't say how reliable it would be serving a cafe full of people all day).  Also, I have it on a 3.8A hub and the only thing plugged directly into the pi's usb is a ""nano""-size wifi dongle.</p>

","<p>I figure that I can safely say now that the problems are due to the device and/or the rt2x00 driver. I have been using Ethernet only the last 48 hours, copied many many Gigabytes of data, and haven't got a single problem.

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I bought a TPL-WN725N with a RTL8188CUS chip. It works out of the box, currently with 0.5 GB of traffic, and still running. It also seems somewhat faster than the Ralink based dongle. I get 1.9MByte/sec, whereas before I had 1.3MByte/sec. Let's see if it will let the Pi run longer and not freeze up.</p>

"Can the Raspberry Pi power this 2.5"" drive without a USB hub?","34859","","<p>I want to use my Raspberry Pi model B as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage"" rel=""nofollow"">NAS</a>, but I'd like to avoid using a USB hub. I have a 2.5"" Western Digital 1 TB USB hard disk drive (<a href=""http://www.amazon.in/Elements-Inch-External-Hard-Black/dp/B0052L77SA"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>), and a 2&nbsp;A power supply for the Raspberry Pi that I'm planning on using with it.</p>

<p>Will this work? Could the Raspberry Pi power this hard disk drive, if I connect only one hard disk drive and nothing else?</p>
","<p>These type of enclosed hard drives conform to the USB specification 2.0 specification, even though it's USB 3.0 it must be able to fall-back. USB 3.0 provides lots more power, but since it falls back it must conform to the USB 2.0 500&nbsp;mA maximum current. The hard drive itself might use more power, but the built-in electronics will detect when to use staggered spin up (takes longer to spin up basically)</p>

<p>The inrush current must not exceed 500&nbsp;mA either; this is when you plug it in, and it spins up. The 3.5"" versions draw much more current on spin up since they always need a dedicated power supply and do not need to conform to the USB specification. That is why it's important to use at least a 1.5&nbsp;A power supply. The Raspberry Pi can use 800&nbsp;mA at peak times on its own. So if you have Wi-Fi maybe it's good to use 2&nbsp;A or 3&nbsp;A power supplies.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi was built to the USB 2.0 specification, but unfortunately due to hardware problems the Raspberry Pi resets itself (brown out) when it needs to provide the 500&nbsp;mA inrush current because of poly fuse and voltage regulator problems or rubbish power supplies that cannot provide the peak current in time. The newest Revision 3, B+ or 2 do not have this problem and this USB hard disk drive will run without any problem.</p>

<p>To get it working on older Raspberry Pi's you either have to bridge the polyfuse or solder +5 directly to the +5&nbsp;V USB pins.</p>

<p>I have used a few USB hard disk drives on older revisions using the workaround and it's stable.</p>

<p>The hard disk drive used in that enclosure is WDBUZG0010BBK.</p>

","<p>From the <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins"" rel=""noreferrer"">Arduino website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Often it is useful to steer an input pin to a known state if no input is present. This can be done by adding a pullup resistor (to +5&nbsp;V), or a pull-down resistor (resistor to ground) on the input, with 10&nbsp;kΩ being a common value.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong>: That is from the Arduino website. Remember that Raspberry GPIO pins are only <strong>3.3&nbsp;V</strong> tolerant (so, do the pullup to 3.3&nbsp;V, <strong>not</strong> 5&nbsp;V on the Raspberry Pi)!!!  </p>

<p>Here's <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Pullup_Resistor.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">an example</a> of a pull-up resistor schematics.</p>

<p>A pull-up will make sure the pin is up without taking in too much current. A gate has three possible states: ON, OFF and FLOATING.</p>

<p>No matter what, you will not much exceed 20 MB/s (read or write) on the pi's SD card bus.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mOxbH.png"" alt=""Circuit Bright Pi""></p>

<p>Since today I noticed the I²C doesn't work anymore as it used to.
Using the commands like '<em>sudo i2cdetect -y 1</em>' and '<em>sudo i2cset -y 1 0x70 0x00 0xff</em>' will give the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could not open file '/dev/i2c-1' or '/dev/i2c/1': No such file or directory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the command '<em>sudo i2cdetect</em>' will give the error</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No i2c-bus specified!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which means the i2c-dev is running.</p>

<p>The file '/etc/modules' looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>#/etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time. 
# This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded
# at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with ""#"" are ignored.
# Parameters can be specified after the module name.

snd-bcm2835
i2c-dev
i2c-bcm2708
</code></pre>

<p>The file '/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf' looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>blacklist spi and i2c by default (many users don't need them)

#blacklist spi-bcm2708
#blacklist i2c-bcm2708
blacklist snd-soc-pcm512x
blacklist snd-soc-wm8804
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried reinstalling all required modules, but that didn't help either. Also <code>apt-get update</code> and <code>apt-get upgrade</code> didn't help.</p>

<p>The command '<em>lsmod | grep i2c</em>' shows this:</p>

<pre><code>i2c_bcm2708          6004  0   
i2c_dev              6709  0
</code></pre>

<p>It is strange, because it used to work before. I might think it is ""broken"" since I did a firmware update two days ago, because my Raspberry Pi was showing weird kernel errors.</p>

<p>How can I fix the problem with the I²C?</p>
","<p>The latest firmware implements <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_tree#Usage_in_Linux"" rel=""noreferrer"">device tree</a> support. That will have broken things like I²C, SPI, and 1-wire bus.</p>

<p>For fuller details see <em><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=675658#p675658"" rel=""noreferrer"">I²C, SPI, I2S, LIRC, PPS, stopped working? Read this.</a></em>.</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<pre><code>Add one or more of the following to your /boot/config.txt and reboot.

I2C
No longer add: dtparam=i2c1=on (or dtparam=i2c0=on on old models)
Instead add: dtparam=i2c_arm=on (as this is correctly mapped to 0 or 1 for each model)
A very few users might need: dtparam=i2c_vc=on (for the other i2c interface - see note below)

SPI
Add dtparam=spi=on

I2S
Add dtparam=i2s=on

lirc-rpi
Add dtoverlay=lirc-rpi
Add module parameters to the end of the dtoverlay line,
e.g. dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_in_pin=16,gpio_in_pull=high

w1-gpio
If you require the external pullup
dtoverlay=w1-gpio-pullup,gpiopin=x,pullup=y
otherwise
dtoverlay=w1-gpio-pullup,gpiopin=x
(where x and y are gpios).

Audio card
Add one of the following
dtoverlay=hifiberry-dac
dtoverlay=hifiberry-dacplus
dtoverlay=hifiberry-digi
dtoverlay=iqaudio-dac
dtoverlay=iqaudio-dacplus

heartbeat LED
dtparam=act_led_trigger=heartbeat
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note:</em> It is recommended that you only use i2c_vc (and i2c_vc_baudrate) if you really need to - for example, if you are programming a HAT EEPROM. Enabling i2c_vc can stop the Pi Camera being detected.</p>

"Commands for using cec-client","33499","","<p>I have the cec-client and libcec working on my Raspberry Pi.  I would like to use it for more than just turning on and off the television, I would like to be able to query the other devices for their system information.  Then maybe control them through the RPi.   :) </p>

<p>Anyway, I'm wondering if there are some good sources of information on the cec-commands.  I know I can send the following:  </p>

<ul>
<li><code>echo ""on 0"" | cec-client -s</code> to turn on the television </li>
<li><code>echo ""standby 0"" | cec-client -s</code> to turn it off</li>
<li>I even found <code>echo 'lang 0' | cec-client -t p -p 1 -d 1 -s | tail -n1 | grep 'language' | awk '{print $3}'</code> which will tell me the television language is 'eng'.  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of the commands were found in the libcec/support/cec-test-device.sh script. <strong>Is there a complete list of built-in libcec commands somewhere?</strong></p>

<p>Alternatively I did look at the <a href=""http://www.cec-o-matic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CEC-O-MATIC</a> tool.  <strong>What type of source is the Raspberry Pi or does it matter?  Is there a way to query what devices are connected to the television from the RPi?</strong>  For example, if I connect and disconnect a Blu-ray player, is there a way to tell that has happened?</p>
","<p>cec-client can tell you the commands it knows</p>

<pre><code>echo h | cec-client -s -d 1

<p>There are a bunch of things that cec can do, that aren't on the list though too. You can press buttons on your remote and see the raw data being passed.</p>

<p>By playing back those same bytes, you can simulate the same functions.</p>

"Spotify for RPI","33402","","<p>Spotify is a versatile and open platform for music worldwide. It is heavy on encryption and very high on CPU usage.</p>

<p>Anyone aware of a yum/apt-get Spotify version for <b>RPI</b> running raspbian? Even without GUI, just command player version will be fine. </p>

<p>I understand that as of May 2015 <em>libspotify</em> is officially deprecated by Spotify and is no longer actively maintained, <em>Libspotify</em> was the base for many products, and now Spotify look only to sdk iPhones (IOS) and Android.</p>
","<p>Thanks for the answers!</p>

<p>Really <code>mopidy</code> made the cut. As most packages is not just plug and play but is very close to that. I will make the installation as brief as possible and it will work fine.</p>

<h1>Ingredients:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Raspberry PI running Wheezy (may also work with Jessie) </li>
<li>PuTTY or similar remote SSH client.</li>
<li>A paid Spotify account. </li>
<li>External speakers, perhaps an USB sound card.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pre-Installation</h1>

<p>Before going into the install, make sure the RPI is ready to play music.</p>

<p>First, activate ipv6.</p>

<pre><code>modprobe ipv6
echo ipv6 | tee -a /etc/modules
</code></pre>

<p>if needed, you can force sound on the analog connector instead of HDMI</p>

<pre><code>amixer cset numid=3 1
</code></pre>

<p>test the sound to confirm your setting is working.</p>

<pre><code>aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
</code></pre>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Note: Either prefix your commands with <code>sudo</code> or just do a 'permanent' <code>sudo -iE</code> before you start.</p>

<p>first, get the KEY from <code>mopidy</code></p>

<pre><code>wget -q -O - https://apt.mopidy.com/mopidy.gpg | apt-key add -
</code></pre>

<p>Add the source list, this is on wheezy.</p>

<pre><code>wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mopidy.list https://apt.mopidy.com/wheezy.list
</code></pre>

<p>or this for Jessie</p>

<pre><code>wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mopidy.list https://apt.mopidy.com/jessie.list
</code></pre>

<p>and now, add the new items, install mopidy and the Spotify extension</p>

<pre><code>apt-get update
apt-get install mopidy
apt-get install mopidy-spotify
</code></pre>

<p>if you are working as root, use this .conf file</p>

<pre><code>/root/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise edit it on your home config.   Search the '[Spotify]' section remove the '#' remarks from the line and edit a few items: </p>

<pre><code>[spotify]
username = alice
password = mysecret
</code></pre>

<p>remove the comments also on the [mpd] section, make explicit that we are not using [local] and [files] adding 'enabled = false'.</p>

<h1>you are done!!</h1>

<p>to test, open a console version and install a client:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install ncmpcpp
</code></pre>

<p>then, form another puTTY run</p>

<pre><code>ncmpcpp
</code></pre>

<p>Good listening!</p>

<p>The <code>LINK LED</code> flickers for a second while booting up, but then it doesn't do anything and they stay OFF. The browser shows NO CONNECTION.</p>

<p>I checked the cable, and when connected to laptop it shows connections, so the cable is still good.</p>

"Where is the script for raspi-config stored in the FS on Raspbian?","33323","","<p>While the raspi-config script makes for convenient setup on first boot, one of the reasons I have a Raspberry Pi is to help me learn what goes on behind the menu on my computers.</p>

","<p>Both of the other answers are correct and will let you view and study how the file works. However, with the idea of teaching you to fish rather than give you a fish, if you do the following it will help you find any file on your system.</p>

<pre><code>sudo find / -name 'raspi-config'
</code></pre>

<h2>Breaking it Down:</h2>

<p><strong>sudo</strong> tells the system to run this command with root privileges - this prevents lots of errors cluttering the system from directories that your regular user (pi) can't access. </p>

<p><strong>find</strong> the name of the Linux command to find files and directories.</p>

<p><strong>/</strong> tells the find command to search the root of the filesystem and all its sub-directories.</p>

<p><strong>-name</strong> tells the find command to search by the file name.</p>

<p><strong>'raspi-config'</strong> this is the file name you are searching for.</p>

<p>to find a  different file just replace the raspi-config with the name of the file you are looking for. There are many other options for the find command and you can find all of the details for most linux commands by typing </p>

<pre><code>man find

"RetroPie & PS3 Controller over Bluetooth","32902","","<p>I've got a <strong>Raspberry Pie 3</strong> <em>(w/ built-in BT)</em>, and <strong>RetroPie 4.0.2</strong> is installed and working on it.  I've got 2 brand new PS3 controllers (I do not own a PS3) and they work with the RetroPie over the USB cable just fine.</p>

<p>I want to get them working over bluetooth, and I've followed <strong>all the guides for this</strong> that I could find online but really they all seem to follow the same steps.  I cannot get the controllers to pair with the Pi!  <em>(interestingly though, I can get it to pair with my MacBook Pro... so I know the BT on the controllers work)</em>  </p>

<h2>Here are the steps I've followed:</h2>

<p><code>RetroPie Setup &gt; Manage Packages &gt; Manage Driver Packages &gt; ps3controller</code></p>

<p>From here I installed the drivers.  My PS3 controller is not currently plugged in. Next I choose <code>Install/Pair PS3 controller</code> and it tells me to connect it via USB then unplug it and press the <kbd>PS</kbd> button.</p>

<p>I plug in the USB, the #1 light on the controller slowly blinks, I wait 10 seconds and the I unplug it.  I press the <kbd>PS</kbd> button and all 4 lights on the controller blink fast and nothing else happens!</p>

<p>From what I've read, what <em>should happen</em> is that I press <kbd>PS</kbd> and then the #1 light comes on and the controller vibrates.  I've read several forum &amp; reddit posts from other people exactly describing the issue I'm having, but no working resolutions have been provided.</p>

<h2>Other Troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>
<li>I've tried uninstalling &amp; re-installing the drivers</li>
<li>I've tried running <code>sudo ./sixpair</code> from a shell connection <a href=""https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Setting-up-a-PS3-controller#for-older-versions-of-retropie"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">following the steps listed here</a></li>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>See my comment below the accepted answer by @Donny V, but I was able to get this working by using the <code>gasia</code> drivers.</p>

<p>The reason this worked for me was because I accidentally purchased a cheap Chinese knock-off controller!  I was able to figure this out based on <a href=""https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/4738/ps3-controller-lag-over-bt-but-not-usb/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this discussion on the RetroPie forum</a>.  Basically, run the <code>dmesg</code> command and I was able to see the manufacturer of all connected devices.  Seeing the devide name of my controller was <code>SZMY-POWER CO.,LTD. PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller</code> - note that it's <strong>not</strong> made by Sony!</p>
","<p>To make the answer obvious for anyone else experiencing the same issues, I followed the steps in Donny V's answer, but that was not working for me.</p>

<p><strong>What eventually did work though</strong> was to choose <em>""Remove PS3 controller configurations""</em> and then choose <em>""Install/Pair PS3 Controller (gasia only)""</em></p>

<p>I'm not sure why this worked since I'm fairly certain these are authentic PS3 controllers... but whatever, it works now.  So my advice to anyone else is to try pairing with each of the driver options until one works.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: as it turns out, my PS3 controllers were chinese knockoffs (but very good ones!).  I ended up selling them and buying real PS3 controllers  and the standard setup process works fine now.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>git</code> is the version control system used by the Linux kernel team.</li>
<li><code>ncurses</code> is a library for build console menus. It is necessary for <code>menuconfig</code>.</li>
<li><code>make</code> runs the compilation for us.</li>
<li><code>gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi</code> is the cross-compiler.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, we need to retrieve the source, run:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux raspberrypi-linux
cd raspberrypi-linux
</code></pre>

<p>This will clone the source code to a directory called <code>raspberrypi-linux</code> and change to it.</p>

<h1>Compilation</h1>

<p>We first need to move the config file by running</p>

<pre><code>cp arch/arm/configs/bcmrpi_cutdown_defconfig .config
</code></pre>

<p>Then configure the kernel build</p>

<pre><code>make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi- oldconfig
</code></pre>

<p><em>Optional:</em> Customise the build using menuconfig</p>

<pre><code>make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi- menuconfig
</code></pre>

<p>Then run the compilation</p>

<pre><code>make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi- -k
</code></pre>

If I shut down and start the RPi up again, no problem, but if I shut down, remove the card, insert, then start the RPi, it can't boot ever again, just waiting at the rainbow start screen always. I also don't need to remove the SD card, only enough to stop the power supply for 30 seconds, (until the condensators completely discharge) and start the RPi, and the same error occurs.</p>

<p>I tried to disable the raspberrypi-firmware package update by adding <code>IgnorePgk = raspberrypi-firmware</code> in <code>/etc/pacman.conf</code> file, and then do the full system update, and then I remove and insert the sdcard, and then I dont see the rainbow screen again, but get this error message:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This error also occurs if I only update the <code>linux-raspberrypi</code> package, and then I only <code>reboot</code> and not remove the sdcard, and I get the same kernel-panic error message.</p>

<p>I have a Samsung SDHC 16GB Class10 (MB-MPAGA aka MB-MPAGAEU) card. I also tried with Kingmax SDHC 16GB Class10 card, and with a Kingmax SDHC 8GB Class6 card, neither worked.</p>

<p><strong>If I ignore the <code>raspberrypi-firmware</code> and the <code>linux-raspberrypi</code> package in pacman, and then do the system update, no error occurs even if I remove the sdcard. So it must be some problem in these packages.</strong></p>
","<p>I'm posting this as an answer as there is not enough space in comments. So from all the information gathered so far it seems that the problem is only related to /boot/ partition contents. Now the problem can be caused by two things:
1. /boot/ filesystem corruption which makes it impossible for bootloader to load firmware files
2. New version of firmware has some regression that prevents your SD card working.
You have to check which one of this is true. </p>

<p>One way of doing this would be to manually update files in /boot/ on your PC. To do this you will have to first ensure that your system is not booting directly to graphical system (because you won't have modules working and this would make it impossible to use keyboard/mouse in X). Then you have to connect your SD card in PC, backup its content, go to the <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware"">github page for firmware files</a>, enter boot directory and download following files (overriding existing ones) to your /boot/ partition - bootcode.bin, kernel.img, start.elf, loader.bin. You won't need override any other files. To download each file you have to click on its name, then click ""view raw"" and save this on disc. After you save all files, ensure that you saftly ejected your SD card and check if it boots. This way you can check if newest firmware files (kernel and bootloader) are able to boot from your SD card. If it's true then we can be sure that your problem is caused by /boot/ partition corruption, not kernel/bootloader regression.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, you should also check how many green led flashes can you see when you see rainbow screen. Some time ago troubleshooting code was added to bootloader and it will blink green led several times to show what went wrong. Here's the list:
    3 flashes: loader.bin not found
    4 flashes: loader.bin not launched
    5 flashes: start.elf not found
    6 flashes: start.elf not launched </p>

<p>If you see no flashes at all then either your firmware is too old to support this or not even bootcode.bin was loaded. 
You can also check if the boot partition is not corrupted by checking if all the files needed for boot (mentioned earlier) are sane (not zero sized, exists etc). 
You can also check which file on boot partition causes problem by restoring only some of them. For example only restore kernel.bin or only start.elf+loader.bin+bootcode.bin. This can tell you if it's firmware or kernel problem.</p>

<p>There are two versions of this wifi adaptor. V1 has the driver included in most images, V2 requires you to download and install a driver as it is not included in the Linux images.</p>

<p>It appears you probably have V2 and need to download and install the driver. You can determine the wifi version you have if you use command lsusb. This will list the WN725N V2 as</p>

<pre><code>Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0bda:8179 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
</code></pre>

<p>The important info is the ID 0bda:8179.</p>

<p>If it shows this you need to download the driver. If you use a recent version of Raspbian there are precompiled versions available.</p>

<p>Precompiled versions of the driver are available for Raspbian as follows</p>

<p>for 3.6.11+ #538, #541, #545, #551 and #557 use 8188eu-20130830.tar.gz</p>

<p>for 3.6.11+ #524, #528 or #532 use 8188eu-20130815.tar.gz</p>

<p>for 3.6.11+ #371 up to #520 use 8188eu-20130209.tar.gz</p>

<p>Use command uname -a to determine the version you have e.g.</p>

<pre><code>pi@raspberrypi ~ $ uname -a
Linux raspberrypi 3.6.11+ #551 PREEMPT Mon Sep 30 14:42:10 BST 2013 armv6l GNU/Linux
pi@raspberrypi ~ $
</code></pre>

<p>Download and install the driver using the commands</p>

<pre><code>wget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/80256631/8188eu-2013xxyy.tar.gz &lt;--set data code for driver version above
tar -zxvf 8188eu-2013xxyy.tar.gz                                         &lt;--set data code for driver version above
sudo install -p -m 644 8188eu.ko /lib/modules/3.6.11+/kernel/drivers/net/wireless
sudo insmod /lib/modules/3.6.11+/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/8188eu.ko
sudo depmod -a
</code></pre>

<p>You can check if the driver is loaded OK with command ifconfig It should show wlan0 something like </p>

<pre><code>wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr a0:f3:c1:25:7d:28
          inet addr:192.168.16.15  Bcast:192.168.16.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

","<p><strong>How I did it</strong></p>

<p><strong>INSTALLING NFS</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://technonstop.com/tutorial-setup-nfs-server-windows"">http://technonstop.com/tutorial-setup-nfs-server-windows</a></p>

<p>Followed the instructions from several websites.</p>

<p>1) Firstly, Grab the ""Services for unix for windows"" from : <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=274"">http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=274</a></p>

<p>2) Do a custom install, selecting <strong>only</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>NFS -> Server for NFS</li>
<li>Authentication tools for NFS -> User Name Mapping</li>
<li>Authentication tools for NFS -> User Name Server for NFS
authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>3) During install select the behaviour to Case Sensitive</p>

<p>4) Next, select Local User Mapping Server -> Password and group files</p>

<p><em>-- My addition</em>
The next stage asks you to upload passwd and group files, I simply created 2 files on the XP desktop. From this post : <a href=""http://www.networkedmediatank.com/showthread.php?tid=1434&amp;pid=460253#pid460253"">http://www.networkedmediatank.com/showthread.php?tid=1434&amp;pid=460253#pid460253</a> I modified the passwd/group files</p>

<p><em>passwd</em></p>

<pre><code>root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
pi:x:1000:1000:pi:/home/pi:/bin/sh
</code></pre>

<p><em>group</em></p>

<pre><code>root:x:0:
pi:x:1000:
</code></pre>

<p>to represent the Raspberry pi user.</p>

<p>5) Once the installation was complete, go <code>start -&gt; windows services for unix -&gt; services for unix administration</code></p>

<p>6) select <code>User Name Mapping</code> on the left, and then the <code>maps</code> option on the right. I didn't select Simple maps, and decided to use advanced maps</p>

<p><em>Show User Maps</em></p>

<p>click <code>list windows users</code> and <code>list unix users</code>. from windows select <code>Administrator</code> from unix select <code>pi</code> then click <code>add</code> ignoring the warning about administrator special account</p>

<p><em>Show Group Maps</em></p>

<p>click <code>list windows groups</code> and <code>list unix groups</code>. from windows select <code>Administrators</code> from unix select <code>pi</code> then click <code>add</code> </p>

<p>Then <code>apply</code> in the top right.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up shares</strong></p>

<p>1) For each of my shares <code>E:\music</code> and <code>E:\movies</code> i right clicked on the folders in windows explorer, selected <code>sharing and security</code> and then the <code>NFS Sharing</code> tab.</p>

<p>2) Within the tab I created the share names <code>music</code> and <code>movies</code> with an encoding of ANSI, <em>unchecking</em> anonymous access</p>

<p>3) Within the permissions button, i <em>unchecked</em> <code>Allow root access</code> and selected <code>Read/Wite</code> as the type of access</p>

<p>4) Ok'd all this</p>

<p>5) Within /etc/fstab on the raspberry pi (via PuTTy) <code>sudo nano /etc/fstab</code> I added the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>192.168.1.40:/music /home/pi/music  nfs defaults,user,auto,noatime,intr 0   0
192.168.1.40:/movies    /home/pi/movies nfs defaults,user,auto,noatime,intr 0   0
</code></pre>

<p>(obviously after creating the relevant directories within /home/pi)</p>

<p><strong>Firewall setup</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately the initial firewall port opening specified in the bottom of this post : <a href=""http://www.networkedmediatank.com/showthread.php?tid=1434&amp;pid=460252#pid460252"">http://www.networkedmediatank.com/showthread.php?tid=1434&amp;pid=460252#pid460252</a> didn't appear to work for me, however (shock) microsoft was on hand to offer that perhaps I should try and open some other ports too.</p>

<pre><code>User Name Mapping and Server for NFS    Portmapper                  TCP, UDP        111
Server for NFS                          Network Status Manager      TCP, UDP        1039
Server for NFS                          Network Lock Manager        TCP, UDP        1047
Server for NFS                          NFS Mount                   TCP, UDP        1048
Server for NFS                          Network File System         TCP, UDP        2049
</code></pre>

<p>(from <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753302(v=ws.10).aspx"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753302(v=ws.10).aspx</a> )</p>

<p><strong>DONE!</strong>
I added the new mounts as sources in both music and movies, and they appear much much more responsive than samba</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I don't know whether this helps anyone but I am connected to the Internet on my pi via wlan0, but I would like to share that Internet connection via eth0.</p>
","<p>For <strong>Raspbian Jessie</strong></p>

<p>From <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By3r0jR6h8ekYnpPak9kV1NsQkU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this document</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will use <code>dnsmasq</code> package for this purpose because it is combined
  DHCP and DNS server and also easy to configure.</p>
  
  <p>If you want something a little more 'heavyweight', you can use the
  <code>isc-dhcp-server</code> and <code>bind9</code> packages for DHCP and DNS respectively,
  but for our purposes, <code>dnsmasq</code> works just fine.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
</code></pre>
  
  <p>We need to configure interfaces. We will assign a static IP address to
  <code>eth0</code> which will be used as gateway. Open the interfaces file</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Edit the <code>eth0</code> section like this:</p>

<pre><code>allow-hotplug eth0  
iface eth0 inet static  
    address 192.168.2.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 192.168.2.0
    broadcast 192.168.2.255
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Next, we will configure <code>dnsmasq</code>. The shipped <code>dnsmasq</code> config file
  contains a lot of information on how to use it. So, I will advise to
  move it and create a new one.</p>

<pre><code>sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig  
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Paste the following into the new file</p>

<pre><code>interface=eth0      # Use interface eth0  
listen-address=192.168.2.1 # listen on  
# Bind to the interface to make sure we aren't sending things 
# elsewhere  
bind-interfaces
server=8.8.8.8       # Forward DNS requests to Google DNS  
domain-needed        # Don't forward short names  
# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.
bogus-priv
# Assign IP addresses between 192.168.2.2 and 192.168.2.100 with a
# 12 hour lease time
dhcp-range=192.168.2.2,192.168.2.100,12h 
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Edit the <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file to enable packet forwarding</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Remove the <code>#</code> from the beginning of the line containing
  <code>net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</code> This will enable packet forwarding on next
  reboot. But if you want to try it right now without reboot then do
  this. </p>

<pre><code>sudo sh -c ""echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward""
</code></pre>
  
  <p>We also need to share RPi’s internet connection with the devices
  connected over Wi-Fi. We will configure a NAT between <code>eth0</code> and
  <code>wlan0</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE  
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT  
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -j ACCEPT  
</code></pre>
  
  <p>However, we need these rules to be applied every time we reboot the
  Pi, so run      <code>sudo sh -c ""iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat""</code>
  to save the rules to the file <code>/etc/iptables.ipv4.nat</code>. Now we need to
  run this after each reboot, so open the <code>/etc/rc.local</code> file with
  <code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code> and just above the line <code>exit 0</code>, add the
  following line:</p>

<pre><code>iptables-restore &lt; /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat  
</code></pre>
  
  <p>And that’s all! Now just Reboot your RPi and you will be able to
  access Internet</p>

<pre><code>sudo reboot
</code></pre>

","<p>Took me a while to figure out what is going on but after installing <code>tcpdump</code>, monitoring the network traffic and more carefully reading the fine print of NTPd docs, I realized that NTPd requires unrestricted access to UDP port 123 for both outgoing and incoming traffic.</p>

<p>The problem might be in the FAT partition, that can be easily recovered by reformating and put back the files (Using either your image or one downloaded from the web.)</p>

<p>If it's the Linux filesystem, loading it on a Linux (even a liveCD) and running <code>fsck</code> might be enough to recover it.</p>

<p>So attach the SD card, open a console and do <code>dmesg</code> to view the label of the last disk (example <code>sdb</code>) discovered, do <code>fdisk -l /dev/sdb</code> to see what partitions exist. The Linux one should be called Linux (example <code>sdb2</code>). finally do <code>fsck /dev/sdb2</code>  to scan and fix the filesystem.</p>

<p>If all fails, maybe the SD has gone bad, I would do a <code>dd if=/dev/sdb of=file.img</code> (of even better <code>dd_rescue /dev/sdb file.img</code> if you have <code>dd_rescue</code> installed) to backup the SD to a file and trying to recover things from there, by transforming the image on a device with <code>losetup --find --show file.img</code> work on it.</p>

<p>Chromium (a fork of chrome) is available for the pi, supports HTML 5, and although it is undocumented, has a <code>--kiosk</code> mode.  I tested this on the raspbian, but I imagine it is in the Arch and Pidora repos as well:</p>

"How long does the RPi last on a battery?","31596","","<p>For how long can the Raspberry Pi run when powered from a battery of a given capacity?</p>

<p>Of course this will strongly depend on how it is used and what devices are connected, but I am trying to get a rough estimate for my use case, to be able to decide what battery to get (while trying to keep the budget low, I don't want to go straight for the 12000 mAh option unless necessary).</p>

<p>I am using it to take a timelapse with <code>raspivid</code> with 2 fps.  CPU usage is always low (&lt; 10%), but I guess GPU usage and the constantly active camera influences the battery life too.  No devices are connected except for the Pi camera.  Perhaps someone already has experience with a similar situation.</p>

<p>Alternatively, how can I measure the power usage of the Pi under actual usage, to estimate the battery life myself?  I do have a multimeter, but breaking the power circuit and inserting a multimeter to measure the current seems like a lot of trouble, especially since it would involve destroying the power cable.</p>
","<p>The pi can't draw more than 1A due to a fuse stopping the board drawing more than that. So how big a battery you need really depends on how long you want it to run. If you have a 500mAh battery, that will output 500mA (0.5A) for one hour, or 1000mA (1A) for half an hour. Similarly, a 2000mAh battery will give you 2000mA (2A) for one hour or 1000mA (1A for two hours). So really it's up to you, your battery, and your budget.</p>

"Why does the Raspberry Pi not have a power button?","31277","","<p>If you buy a computer you expect it to come with a power button. So why does the Raspberry Pi not have one? Is it because it would take up too much room or be awkward to fit on the PCB?</p>

<p>Personally the lack of a power button is something which has always slightly irritated me, because to fully shut down the Pi you have to pull the power cable out. And I'm sure I am not the only one who has plugged in the Pi and it has started up without you wanting it to. I feel like a power button would save the hassle of having to pull the power cable out or switching off the power at the mains.</p>
","<p>Modern power buttons use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface"">Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</a> to request the OS to turn its motherboard off. That's why, for a couple decades now, if you really want the motherboard off and the OS refuses, you had to mash its power button for several seconds.</p>

<p>A simple power switch, like a light switch, could de-power the CPU just when it's doing something important, or when virtual files are changed, and the OS needs to write them to the SD card.</p>

<p>So if the Raspberry went with a cheap on-off switch, more people would use it wrong and get in trouble. And adding the full ACPI harness to the motherboard would naturally make it more expensive.</p>

<p>I always issue <code>sudo shutdown</code> from inside a Pi, and give it a moment to collect its thoughts, before yanking its power. (And you should never power off by yanking the tiny, fragile MicroUSB plug from the Pi. I try to always power off using a power strip's switch, or by unplugging the distal end of the USB power wire.)</p>

<p>Finally, there's the slight matter that many RPIs are simply never turned off. (-;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So, I'm running Xbmc on my Raspberry Pi and I'm having trouble understanding what I can actually play with it and what not.</p>

<p>I read the RPi can play <strong>H.264</strong> encoded videos, but I can only find <strong>x264</strong> encoded videos. Will that work, too? And if so, why won't <em>some</em> files work probably?</p>
","<p>There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding around what H.264 (with a dot) actually is. So, quoting from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10 or AVC (Advanced Video Coding) is <strong>a <em>standard</em> for
  video compression</strong>, and is currently one of the most commonly used
  formats [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important part to stretch here is that it's only a <em>standard</em>. That means, videos are not actually encoded with H.264, but with a codec that meets the H.264 standard. One of the most common ones is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X264"">x264</a> (lower-case x, no dot):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>x264 is a free <strong>software library for encoding video streams into the H.264</strong>/MPEG-4
  AVC format.
  <br>[...]<br>
  x264 implements a large number of features compared to other H.264 encoders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, H.264 is kind of an Interface and x264 is an Implementation (with the actual functionality) of that interface.</p>

<p><strong>So, the Pi will play x264 encoded files just fine.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Then <strong>why do some x264 encoded files not play smoothly but stop every 4-6 seconds</strong> (depending on the amount of GPU-Ram)?</p>

<p>Most of the time, <strong>it's the sound</strong>. Since x264 is an encoder for HD video files, most of those files come with a digital high-quality sound-track, which uses the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTS_%28sound_system%29#DTS_audio_codec"">DTS-codec</a>.</p>

<p>The Pi is (at the moment) not able to hardware-decode the DTS-track and it's CPU is not powerful enough. There is a discussion about this <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=15546"">on the official Forums</a> which is worth looking into.</p>

<p>To find out if this is the case for you, you can use the <code>mediainfo</code>-tool (must be installed, package-names depend on your distro):</p>

<pre><code>[tv@raspberry]$ mediainfo some_random_movie.mkv 
# Shortened output!
Audio #2
ID                                       : 3
Format                                   : DTS
Format/Info                              : Digital Theater Systems
Codec ID                                 : A_DTS
</code></pre>

<p>You now have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy a DTS-capable receiver (maybe your TV can do it, too?) and <a href=""http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Raspberry_Pi/FAQ#Video_and_audio_formats_the_Raspberry_Pi_can_playback"">enable ""pass-through""</a> (last point) in Xbmc (or whatever player you're using).</li>
<li>Convert the DTS-Tracks to AC3, which can be passed through (faster) or CPU decoded.</li>
</ol>

<p>To find out what your receiver (the thing you plugged your HDMI-cable in) is capable of, use the <code>tvservice</code>-tool (which is not in the PATH, so you'll need the full path):</p>

<pre><code>[tv@raspberry ~]$ /opt/vc/bin/tvservice -a
     PCM supported: Max channels: 2, Max samplerate:  48kHz, Max samplesize 24 bits.
     AC3 supported: Max channels: 6, Max samplerate:  48kHz, Max rate  640 kb/s.
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, my current receiver is capable of decoding PCM and AC3 (not DTS).</p>

<p>My solution to this problem is to convert the Audio-Tracks which are DTS to AC3. Here is a small one-liner that converts <strong>all</strong> audio-streams in <code>infile.mkv</code> to AC3 and doesn't touch the video:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg"">ffmpeg</a></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i infile.mkv -map 0 -codec:v copy -codec:s copy -codec:a ac3 outfile.mkv
</code></pre>
  
  <hr>
  
  <p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libav"">avconv</a></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>avconv -i infile.mkv -map 0 -vcodec copy -acodec ac3 -ab 256k outfile.mkv
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> The above command also sets the <strong>bit-rate for the resulting AC3 encoded audio-stream</strong> (which is necessary, it seems). While 256kbps is
  reasonably good (most DVD's use 192kbps), you might want to
  in/decrease it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luckily, this takes only around 5 minutes (depending on your hardware, of course). As a little bonus, your file becomes smaller and if you're not an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiophile"">Audiophile</a>, you won't hear a difference.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Still, 1080p FullHD Movies are stuttering</strong>, the screen goes black for a few seconds with no sound but the video-playback seems to continue. The Movie is H.264 encoded in an MKV container with AC3 tracks. What is the problem?</p>

<p>Most likely, there is nothing wrong with the movie-file, but with your Xbmc settings. In my case, the <strong>problem was the ""refresh rate"" of Xbmc</strong>. This is set to 60Hz by default. For 720p and any other small video files, this seems to not be a problem for the Pi, but 1080p files result in the above problem.</p>

<p>Lower the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate"">refresh-rate</a> to something less than 60Hz (at least 24Hz are sufficient for Movies). There are two options here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Global Xbmc (including Xbmc itself): <code>System -&gt; Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Video output -&gt; Refresh rate</code></li>
<li>Movies only (determined by video-file): <code>System -&gt; Settings -&gt; Video -&gt; Playback -&gt; Adjust display refresh rate to match video</code></li>
</ol>

<p>After lowering the refresh rate, <strong>1080p movies should also play just fine.</strong></p>

","<p>Yes this is completely possible. However, in reality it's a little bit different to how you are thinking.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Preamble</h1>

<p>The SD card contains an <em>image</em> of the operating system. And works by inflating this image when the device is powered on.</p>

<p>As I expect you already know, you flash this image onto the SD card in order to create a working system. However, what you can do <strong>before</strong> you flash the image is have a play around with it using <strong>QEMU</strong>, which is a <em>processor emulator</em>, and allows us to emulate the ARM instruction set. </p>

<p>In this way, any changes you make to the image (installing, compiling etc) will still be there after you flash it to the SD card.</p>

<p>I'll now talk you through how to use QEMU to load the image. I will be demonstrating with the Arch Linux image, but the process should be the same regardless.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Using QEMU</h1>

<h3>Prerequesites</h3>

<p>You will need to acquire <a href=""http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page"" rel=""noreferrer"">QEMU</a> for your system. 
QEMU should only have one requirement, in order in input devices to work you need to have the SDL development package installed, which should be available from your package manager.</p>

<p>I recommend downloading the package using your regular package manager:</p>

<p><strong>Arch</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo pacman -S sdl qemu
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Ubuntu</strong>:</p>

<p>More recent versions (since 14.04) have a package for it:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install qemu-system-arm
</code></pre>

<p>For older versions:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linaro-maintainers/tools
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qemu-system
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Building QEMU yourself</strong></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can build QEMU yourself. This is great if you want to try a new version, but it can be slow and be prepared for lots of errors during compilation! Note that if building QEMU from their website it must be compiled for ARM support. So check your distro repositories first. This can be done like so;</p>

<pre><code>mkdir rpi-emu &amp;&amp; cd rpi-emu
wget http://wiki.qemu.org/download/qemu-1.1.0-1.tar.bz2
tar xvjf qemu-1.1.0-1.tar.bz2
cd qemu-1.1.0-1
./configure –target-list=arm-softmmu,arm-linux-user
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Verify that you have ARM support with:</p>

<p>We're working with Arch Linux, so will be using the Arch Arm image. But replace this with whatever you wish to work with, or perhaps you already have an image. In which case, skip this step.</p>

<pre><code>wget http://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk/mirrors/raspberrypi.org/images/archlinuxarm/archlinuxarm-29-04-2012/archlinuxarm-29-04-2012.zip
unzip archlinuxarm-29-04-2012.zip 
</code></pre>

<p>For QEMU to work we also need the kernel image (which would be inside the .img file). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I don't think this step is necessary for Debian. Someone please confirm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luckily there are precompiled images available, and you can use the one from <a href=""http://www.cnx-software.com/2011/10/18/raspberry-pi-emulator-in-ubuntu-with-qemu/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> (<a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45842273/zImage"" rel=""noreferrer"">direct download</a>). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TODO: Demonstrate how to compile a kernel image here?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Starting the VM</h3>

<p>You should now have:</p>

<ul>
<li>An img file which you can verify using the supplied sha1 (recommended).</li>
<li>A kernel image (zImage).</li>
<li>QEMU for ARM.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Virtual Machine can now be started using the following long-winded command:</p>

<pre><code>qemu-system-arm -kernel zImage -cpu arm1176 -M versatilepb -serial stdio -append ""root=/dev/sda2"" -hda archlinuxarm-29-04-2012.img -clock dynticks
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that you will only have several hundred megabytes of storage using this method (whatever is spare on the image). A virtual hard disk can be created by following the <a href=""http://qemu.weilnetz.de/qemu-doc.html#disk_005fimages"" rel=""noreferrer"">QEMU user guide</a>.</p>

Description: Python 2 wrapper around the OpenSSL library
High-level wrapper around a subset of the OpenSSL library, includes
 .
   * SSL.Connection objects, wrapping the methods of Python's portable
     sockets
   * Callbacks written in Python
   * Extensive error-handling mechanism, mirroring OpenSSL's error
     codes
 .
A lot of the object methods do nothing more than calling a
corresponding function in the OpenSSL library.

<p>Bonus question: What baud rates are available on the RPi?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Since reading up from Steve's answer, I have found that there are two UARTs available.</p>

<p>The mini-UART can work up to 32Mbaud, but has a small buffer and so would need a lot of CPU to keep up.</p>

<p>There is also a more fully featured UART with bigger buffers, I haven't found the minimum/maximum speed for it yet.</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1524403.pdf"">Farnell's Quick Start Guide</a>, the default baud rate is: <strong>115200</strong>. A fairly detailed discussion of the UART settings and capabilities can be found in this blog post <a href=""http://lavalink.com/2012/04/more-on-raspberry-pi-serial-ports/"">More on Raspberry Pi serial ports</a>. More specific implementation details/challenges of working with the serial port can be found in the blog post <a href=""http://fw.hardijzer.nl/?p=138"">Getting my Raspberry Pi set up for high-speed serial UART communication</a>. </p>

<p>You don't mention which distribution you are running, but assuming you are running Debian you can set the baud rate by doing the following:</p>

<p>Note the Raspberry Pi uses the UART for Console Messages (including bootup messages) and getty so you can login via serial. To use this serial port for your own uses you will need to disable these services. </p>

<p>To change the console baudrate, edit <strong>/boot/cmdline.txt</strong> relacing <strong>115200</strong> with your desired baud rate (note this is all one line).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200
  console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then edit <strong>/etc/inittab</strong> to change the baudrate of the getty (you
should find a line like the following with the baudrate of 115200, change that
to your desired baud rate)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100</p>

<p>and, remember to watch your pin voltages to avoid damage to you Pi.</p>

<p>The yellow-white-red ports are for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_video"">composite video</a> (yellow) and stereo audio (red and white). These plugs typically use RCA connectors.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/RaspiModelB.png"">The Pi</a> has an RCA composite video out, and a 3.5mm audio out jack (the same thing you'd find on a smartphone, iPod etc, i.e. a ""headphone jack"")</p>

<p>So, to connect the Pi to your TV, you need:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000HDKZPU"">An RCA male to RCA male composite video cable</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00004Z5CP"">A 3.5mm to RCA audio splitter cable</a></li>

<p>Those are just two examples that popped up at the top of an Amazon search. You can probably find cheaper ones, get them at Best Buy, etc.</p>

<p>Your second picture is of an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-video"">S-video</a> port, which won't work with the Pi.</p>

<p>Your third picture is of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_video"">component video</a> ports. It has separate cables (red, green, and blue) for each video component (as opposed to a ""composite"" cable, which crams them all into one cable). Then it also has white and red ports for audio. That won't work with the Pi either, since the Pi only has composite out.</p>

<p>I followed the directions <a href=""http://simonthepiman.com/how_to_setup_windows_file_server.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> as well as I could as I have Raspbian installed on my Pi. When I plugged in my USB drive it automounted to <code>/media/Media/</code> so I skipped the first part.</p>

<p>What I did was the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>sudo -i</code></li>
<li><code>apt-get update</code></li>
<li><code>apt-get upgrade</code></li>
<li><code>apt-get install samba</code></li>
<li><code>apt-get install samba-common-bin</code></li>
<li><p>Edited samba config</p>

    directory mask = 0777  
    guest only = Yes  
    guest ok = Yes
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>So the setup appears OK, I can see the files in <code>/media/Media</code> on the Pi, I can see <code>RASPBERRYPI</code> in my workgroup from my Windows7 box. But when I try to access it I get a logon failure. I also have a 2nd pi with RaspBMC installed and I also cannot access the SMB share from there either.</p>

<p>Is there something else I need to do in Samba to get this working?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
I did some more work on this last night.
I added a new user to the Raspberry, set a password, added a new user to Samba, set the password and added the following lines.</p>

<pre><code>[global]  
security=user  
[usb]  
allow users biff
</code></pre>

<p>(or something similar I forget the exact syntax)</p>

<p>And now I've managed to get an error like... ""You do not have authorization to access this share"". I'm thinking perhaps I'll work on my Pi directly tonight instead of using putty and perhaps there is something I'll be able to see when using a text editor instead of <code>vi</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>

<p>Ok I finally resolved this. The problem was that I could not use the pi login to access the pie using smb and also that I could not change the permissions of the automounted /media/Media drive.<br>
I found my solution here <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/57092/cant-change-permission-ownership-group-of-external-hard-drive-on-ubuntu"">https://superuser.com/questions/57092/cant-change-permission-ownership-group-of-external-hard-drive-on-ubuntu</a><br>
I had to install ntfs<br>
<code>sudo apt-get install ntfs-config</code><br>
and then I ran the ntfs configuration tool which just gives anyone read/write access.</p>

<p>Not the best solution but it is sufficient in my case for sharing files on the network.</p>

<p>Right now both Pi and my laptop are on the WiFi.</p>
","<p>You may want to try these instructions:</p>

<p>The local IP address of your Raspberry Pi is not fixed, unless you are using a wireless adapter to connect, which will keep its IP address. You must be on the same Wi-Fi network for this to work. If you want to use SSH for the RPI, you can use these steps: </p>

<p>This is for remote desktop connection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start up your Pi to the terminal prompt.  Type the following command
  ""sudo apt-get install xrdp"" If promoted enter your password (the
  default is ""raspberry"") Type ""Y"" and press enter. This is now
  installing xrdp onto your Pi which is the software we are going to use
  for the remote desktop connection.  Wait for it to complete. Restart
  your Pi.  We are going to check that xrdp is going to start up
  automatically. When your Pi has booted to the command prompt look for
  [ ok ] Starting Remote Desktop Protocol server : xrdp sesman.  This
  shows you that xrdp is installed and automatically starting up on
  start up of your Pi The last step is to make a note of the IP address
  of your Pi which should also be displayed on the start up screen.  In
  my case below it is 192.168.1.9.  This is the address of your Pi on
  your network and what we will use to connect to your Pi from the
  second machine.</p>
  
  <p>Second Machine Setup</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Launch Remote Desktop Connection which can be found at Start->All Programs->Accessories->Remote Desktop Connection</li>
  <li><p>Type in the IP Address for your Pi which you noted above.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click Connect (you may get a security warning at this stage just click OK if you do.  After all it is your Pi on your network so
  nothing to worry about security wise).</p></li>
  <li><p>Leave the Module on the default of sesman-Xvnc and enter your username and password for your Pi.  (The default is pi and raspberry
  if you haven't changed them).</p></li>
  <li><p>Click OK and after a few moments you should be greeted my your Raspberry Pi's desktop!</p></li>
  <li><p>When you are finished simply log-out from the Pi's desktop.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I found these step from <a href=""http://www.raspberrypiblog.com/2012/10/how-to-setup-remote-desktop-from.html/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and they worked for me</p>

<p>Here is another way to use SSH:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SSH into Raspberry Pi I generally log into my Raspberry Pi via SSH, or
  Secure Shell to give it its full name. This allows command line
  access, to your Raspberry Pi, from another computer. Although it is
  possible to SSH into the Raspberry Pi from anywhere in the world, and
  I do, this post only covers SSH access over the local network. I will
  cover remote connection in a future blog post.</p>
  
  <p>Although this does not give access to a GUI (Graphical User
  Interface), having access to the command line generally allows me to
  do 95% of what I need to do. The other 5% I could probably do through
  SSH, but sometimes you can't beat the comfort of a GUI. :-)</p>
  
  <p>First of all you need to know the IP address of the Raspberry Pi you
  are wanting to log into. If you are unsure how to find this, then read
  my blog post explaining how you can do this remotely using an
  excellent tool called nmap.</p>
  
  <p>To SSH into your Raspberry Pi from a Linux or Apple Mac computer this
  is very easy. You can just type your username and IP address into the
  command line using the following format:</p>
  
  <p>ssh username@IPaddress</p>
  
  <p>Ensure you substitute username with the username you are wanting to
  log into the remote computer with. The IP address should take the
  format 192.168.1.66</p>
  
  <p>You may get a message explaining that the authenticity of the host
  cannot be established, and if you are sure you want to continue
  connecting.  You will only see this message the first time you SSH
  into your Raspberry Pi. Simply type yes.</p>
  
  <p>You will then be asked for your password, enter the password for the
  username you are trying to connect with.</p>
  
  <p>For windows this is a little more tricky to set up as it requires an
  additional piece of software called PuTTY. However once installed this
  is really simple to use.</p>
  
  <p>First go to the PuTTY website, www.putty.org, download and install the
  software.</p>
  
  <p>Once installed load PuTTY</p>
  
  <p>Under Host Name (or IP address) type in the IP address you would like
  to connect to. Select the SSH radio button. In the box under Saved
  Sessions type in a name to identify this computer, such as Raspberry
  Pi, and then click Save. Clicking on Open should now start your SSH
  session.</p>
  
  <p>Next time you want to SSH into your Raspberry Pi you just need to load
  PuTTY, click on the saved session to highlight it and then click Open.
  Once you have typed in your password, when asked, you have remote
  access to your Raspberry Pi.</p>

"Where is the bottleneck of web browse speed on raspberry pi?","28647","","<p>On a Model B 512 MB Pi with Raspbian “wheezy”, I have tried Midori, Chromium and Iceweasel. When the web page gets larger, loading is slow, even after I overclocked it to 1 GHz. On an Android phone with a 1 GHz CPU, the web page loading seems much faster.</p>

<p>What I want to know is, where's the bottleneck in the Pi? Is it the CPU, or RAM size, or unaccelerated X server? Is it possible for the browser to use GPU directly in order to speed it up?</p>
","<p>It's a combination of the Raspberry Pi's fairly weak ARM11 CPU and the unaccelerated X server. Since it's not accelerated by the GPU, the CPU has to do all the rendering; on something like the ARM11 core in the Pi, this puts a lot of extra strain on an already weak CPU.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, while watching <code>htop</code> while Midori on the Pi loads a heavy website like Facebook, I've seen the X process take up to 25% of the CPU.</p>

<p>It's not really fair to compare the chip in your Android phone to the chip (even overclocked) in the Pi. The 1 GHz chip in your phone is probably something like a Cortex-A8 or A9, which use the ARMv7 version of the architecture; thus, they are higher performance per clock cycle than the ARM11, which uses ARMv6.</p>

What I want is my full, normal RasPi GUI running in a window on my remote windows PC.  I do not want to use VNC.  I am forwarding over the internet. How do I get there?</p>
","<p>If you start Xming on your Windows computer, then you already have an X server running. You don't have to start the X server of your Raspberry Pi using startx. Your X applications will run on the Raspberry Pi but the application will draw onto Xming X server.</p>

"How to get the Raspberry Pi's IP address for SSH","28559","","<p>I am using Mac OSx to access my Pi via SSH. To access it, I know that I need the Pi's IP address. So, I decided to use a few Python commands which have always succeeded in giving me the local IP.</p>

<pre><code>import socket
host_name = socket.gethostname()
host_ip = socket.gethostbyname(host_name)
print host_ip
</code></pre>

<p>Oddly enough, I have only gotten the local host IP (127.0.1.1). </p>

<p>Can someone please tell me how to get the proper local / global (whichever is better, this only needs to work over LAN for now) IP for the PI?</p>
","<p>If Python is a must, you can check this article:
<a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/439094-get-the-ip-address-associated-with-a-network-inter/"">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/439094-get-the-ip-address-associated-with-a-network-inter/</a></p>

<p>They rightly point out that a computer has as many IP addresses as network interfaces.</p>

<p>Here is their code to get the IP address of a network adapter, I've tested the code and it works:</p>

<pre><code>import socket
import fcntl
import struct

def get_ip_address(ifname):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    return socket.inet_ntoa(fcntl.ioctl(
        s.fileno(),
        0x8915,  # SIOCGIFADDR
        struct.pack('256s', ifname[:15])
    )[20:24])

print get_ip_address('lo')
print get_ip_address('eth0')
</code></pre>

<p>If your RPi is connected via WiFi the adapter name should be <code>wlan0</code> </p>

<p>Otherwise you can get it with the <code>ip</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>ip addr show eth0 | grep inet
</code></pre>

<p>You should get something like:</p>

<pre><code>inet 192.168.0.140/24 brd ....
</code></pre>

<p>That's your IP address. </p>

<p>Of course none of this will work if you just boot up your RPi and could not connect to it because you don't know the IP address! If' that's the case your DHCP server will surely be able to tell you which IP address he just gave to the RPi (or you just try them all :) )</p>

<p>That said, you might benefit of referencing you RPi by name and, since you're using a Mac, probably the best solution would be to install avahi-daemon:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
</code></pre>

<p>which implements the Apple Zeroconf specification (like Bonjour). You can then ssh to your RPi by name:</p>

<pre><code>ssh pi@raspberry.local
</code></pre>

<p>I used a different approach for my two Raspberrys (named <em>ygdrasill</em> and <em>dvalinn</em>): I've opted for a fixed IP (192.168.0.140 and 192.168.0.142) so I can also use etc/hosts file on some of my other machines. </p>

<p>I could have set up an internal DNS or rely on Wins, but current solution works for me.</p>

"How do I reset a USB device using a script?","28243","","<p>I have a USB GSM modem that does not alwasys work property (Huawei E367u-2)
Sometimes it gets reset (USB device disconnect/reconnect in logs) and when it comes back up, it's has different ttyUSB numbers. Sometimes on boot, usb_modswitch seems to just not get fired. The computer is a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian.</p>

<p>I have a simple solution to this, every minute CRON runs the following script:</p>

<pre><code>If WVDIAL is not running:
    Run WVDIAL
</code></pre>

<p>I want to change the script to be this:</p>

<pre><code>If /dev/ttyUSB0 is not present:
    If DevicePresent(12d1:1446):
        ResetDevice(12d1:1446)
    ElseIs DevicePresemt(12d1:1506)
        ResetUSB(12d1:1506)
If WVDIAL is not running:
    Run WVDIAL
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is pseudo code, but I have the following lines that I need to string together but I can't figure out how:</p>

<p>This loads wvdial if it is not running:</p>

<pre><code>#! /bin/sh 
# /etc/init.d/wvdial

    ;;
  *)
    echo ""Usage: /etc/init.d/noip {start|stop}""
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

exit 0
</code></pre>

<p>This lets me find the <code>/sys</code> path to a certain device:</p>

<pre><code>for X in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*; do
    echo ""$X""
    cat ""$X/idVendor"" 2&gt;/dev/null
    cat ""$X/idProduct"" 2&gt;/dev/null
    echo
done
</code></pre>

<p>And this resets a USB device if you know the correct /sys path:</p>

<pre><code>echo 0 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.2.1.1/authorized
echo 1 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.2.1.1/authorized
</code></pre>

<p>So, I need to string the last 2 sections and a test to <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> into a section that goes under the ""If you want a command to always run. put it here"" section</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong></p>

<p>usbreset, although functioning, does not do the job.
Only echo 0 the 1 into <code>authroized</code> correctly simulates a device disconnect/reconnect.<br>
This is what does the trick of booting the device or usb_modeswitch back into life.
As such I've managed to cobble together this:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""Searching for $1""
devPath=`lsusb | grep $1 | sed -r 's/Bus ([0-9]{3}) Device ([0-9]{3}).*/bus\/usb\/\1\/\2/g;'`
echo ""Found $1 @ $devPath""
echo ""Searching for sysPath""
for sysPath in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*; do
    echo ""$sysPath/uevent""
    devName=`cat ""$sysPath/uevent"" | grep $devPath`
    #echo devName=$devName
    if [ ! -z $devName ] 
    then
        break
    fi
done
if [ ! -z  $devName ] 
then
    echo ""Found $1 @ $sysPath, Resetting""
    echo ""echo 0 &gt; $sysPath/authorized""
    echo 0 &gt; $sysPath/authorized
    echo ""echo 1 &gt; $sysPath/authorized""
    echo 1 &gt; $sysPath/authorized
else
    echo ""Could not find $1""
fi
</code></pre>

<p>I think therefore all I have to do now is put this in the init.d script:</p>

<pre><code>if ttyUSB0 not present
    if 12d1:1446 present
        /usr/sbin/resetdevicebyauthorized 12d1:1446
    else if 12d1:1506 present
        /usr/sbin/resetdevicebyauthorized 12d1:1506

"Raspbian stuck in read-only after reboot","28128","","<p>I'm the new owner of a Raspberry Pi and I'm having trouble with my file-system getting stuck in read-only mode after rebooting the device.</p>

<p>Here's the hardware I'm working with:</p>

<p>Pi: model B</p>

<p>PSU: Samsung GSIII charger 5A 1A</p>

<p>SD: Kingston 8GB (brand new)</p>

<p>input: basic USB keyboard and mouse</p>

<p>video: HDMI</p>

<p>I can install Raspbian using the NOOBS image just fine and once I'm in I can configure and install programs but after a reboot 90% of the time on boot up I get a warning about the file-system being read only and after I log into the shell I can't do any task that involves writing to a file. I can't even launch the desktop. I can run any shell programs I had installed before reboot. I'm rebooting only using the commands <code>sudo reboot</code> and <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code>. When shutting down I wait for the video to die and the light on the Pi to stop blinking before removing power. I've tried re-imaging the SD card many times and the first boot always works fine, sometimes it lets me reboot once or twice but it always has the same problem eventually. I have a moderate familiarity with Unix/Linux but this is my first attempt at using a Pi. Help!</p>
","<p>Have a look in <code>/var/log/syslog</code> and see if you can find some indication of why. If the filesystem is mounting read-only, the <em>last</em> thing in that file will be whatever happened when it was still read-write, since the system cannot log there otherwise.  Which may or may not be helpful... </p>

<p>The kernel's own log is in memory, however, and does not require a writable filesystem to access.  You can view it with:</p>

<pre><code>dmesg | less
</code></pre>

<p>Have a look at that right after you reboot.</p>

<p><strong>[Then based on that...]</strong></p>

<p>From the pictures it would appear you have either root filesystem corruption or a bad SD card.  Let's hope it's the former.</p>

<p>Re-flashing the whole image over and over is kind of a brute method and doesn't provide any clues about the problem.  Instead, put the SD card into another linux system (you can use a liveCD), but don't mount it (or <code>umount</code> it if it automounts).  Then, if the second partition on the card is <code>/dev/sdb2</code>:</p>

<pre><code>e2fsck -p -c /dev/sdb2
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-p</code> means repair automatically, the <code>-c</code> is check for bad blocks.  You should see some output about the things being fixed.  This doesn't guarantee everything will be fine, but as long as the corruption is not too extensive, you should be okay.  Do a second run <code>e2fsck -f</code>; <code>-f</code> forces the check since this time it may be marked ""clean"".  If that goes okay, the fs is as repaired as it is going to get.</p>

<p>Try booting that, and if it works, you are in luck.  If not, try with another SD card to make sure yours is not defective.</p>

<p>When shutting down, give it a good 15-20 seconds after all activity has stopped before you pull the power.  Quite a few people come here with fs corruption problems, evidently the pi is very sensitive this way.</p>

"How can I install the KUMAN 3.5 inch-display?","27800","","<p>I have a perfectly running Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, with a Raspbian Distribution on a 16 GB SD-Card. I connected a Screen with a HDMI-to-DVI Connector to it, a Mouse and Keyboard and I also have SSH access. Further I got a Kuman 3.5 Inch Touch-Display, which I want to use on it. I read myself through the Internet enough that I know I can't use the Screen and the HDMI-Screen simultaneously. So I connected the Screen to the right Pins, the Backlight already works. So I take the Drivers that are sent with it. Searched the one for my Distribution, extracted the Script onto my Raspberry Pi and launched it through./LCD-35 in the terminal. After a few seconds it Reboots and the Color-Test appears. The Screen for the NOOBS-Recovery-Mode appears, which I can still use, then a few seconds later: </p>

"Using an old laptop keyboard with Raspberry Pi","27789","","<p>I have an old laptop keyboard like the one shown below:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SX7yd.jpg"" alt=""old laptop keyboard""></p>

<p>It has a 24-wire flat cable coming out of the back. Would it be possible to use this as a keyboard for the Pi (I assume with some microcontroller in between)?</p>
","<p>There is no easy or simple way to achieve what you ask.
The simplest answer is just ignore this keyboard and get a USB one.</p>

<p>However, if you <em>really</em> want to do it, it's a DIY job through and through. Your solution will be custom to this keyboard and may or may not be easily adapted to accommodate keyboards from other manufacturers.</p>

<p>Laptop keyboard connectors are not standard. They vary across manufacturers. Typically, they also lack any electronics to process the keypresses and convert them into simpler data messages, e.g. key codes or button codes etc.</p>

<p>Therefore, first you need to figure out what happens each time you press a key, i.e. which electrical signals get activated (get shorted together).</p>

<p>Then you have two options, both very tricky:</p>

<p>Option 1 - Very advanced:</p>

<p>You need to construct an electronic interface which will connect between the keyboard and the USB port on the Pi. It needs a microcontroller to emulate a USB keyboard when it's plugged into the USB port and you will need to write software to map the key pressing signals into USB keyboard presses. The microcontroller needs to do all the work. You might want to read this related question: <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/1997/can-i-make-a-full-usb-keyboard-with-makey-makey-raspberry-pi?rq=1"">Can I make a full USB keyboard with Makey Makey + Raspberry Pi</a></p>

<p>Option 2 - Insanely advanced:</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi has a connector with 17 GPIO (general purpose input output) pins. You need to design a circuit to reduce the 24 keyboard lines and interface them to the GPIO pins. Then you need a custom keyboard driver for the Pi operating system.</p>

<p>Hint:</p>

<p>Some of the 24 connector lines will be inputs and others outputs. Each time a key is pressed, some of the inputs connect to some of the outputs. Some of the lines may be unused. It will take patience and a continuity checker to figure out exactly what happens. Also consider searching for keyboard encoder chips. This is an example: <a href=""http://www.ti.com/product/tca8418e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.ti.com/product/tca8418e</a> These chips take out the hard work of encoding.</p>

"SSH not working with fresh install","27491","","<p>I recently liberated an old model B from the loft, put NOOBS on an SD card, and installed the latest version of Raspbian on it. I booted it up, attempted to SSH to it from my Mac, but got:</p>

"How can I test if the serial / UART is good on a Raspberry Pi?","27488","","<p>I've purchased a used Raspberry Pi and have followed the instructions from <a href=""http://wolfpaulus.com/jounal/embedded/raspberry_serial/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wolf Paulus's Journal</a> to connect to the Raspberry Pi from my computer using a PL2303 USB adapter. The specifications on the PL2303 adapter say that it is for use with 3.3&nbsp;V devices such as the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Sending data to <code>/dev/cu.usbserial</code> and watching the voltages on the TX and RX confirms that the maximum voltages are right around 3.3&nbsp;V - so I believe the adapter is good and that it is connected to the three correct pins (common ground, no connection with the red +5&nbsp;V wire).</p>

<p>When I boot the Raspberry Pi I'm not getting any console messages via the serial device even though I'm using the default Raspbian image. I've tried <code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code> with both <code>console=ttyAMA0,115200</code> (default) and also <code>console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200</code> as was suggested elsewhere, but I get nothing.</p>

<p>When I run <code>stty -F /dev/ttyAMA0</code> I get:</p>

<pre><code>speed 115200 baud; line = 0;
-brkint -imaxbel
</code></pre>

<p>Other than purchasing more of these and swapping them around, how can I test the Raspberry Pi to see if the serial / UART is good? And how can I test the PL2303 USB cable to see if that is good? Are there low-level tests I can do? Or perhaps something with an oscilloscope?</p>

<p>Additional information per @joan's request:</p>

<ul>
<li>The USB is connected to the computer</li>
<li>I have tried connecting with 115200, 38400, and 9600 bit/s</li>
<li>I'm not even getting strange characters to indicate that the baud is incorrect</li>
<li>On the computer I'm using screen to connect:</li>
<li><code>screen /dev/tty.usbserial 115200 8N1</code></li>
<li><code>/dev/tty.usbserial</code> and <code>/dev/cu.usbserial</code> are the devices for this USB adapter</li>
<li>On the Raspberry Pi I'm using a stock <code>2014-09-09-wheezy-raspbian</code> image which has ""Enable/Disable shell and kernel messages on the serial connection"" set to ""Enabled"" (default setting)</li>
<li>The pins are connected to the Raspberry Pi like this. I have tried switching white / green ""just in case"", but without luck either way:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tWPu5.png"" alt=""Connection""></p>

<p>I believe I'm doing everything correctly so my question is more about how to know if there is either a problem with the USB adapter or the Raspberry Pi's serial connection.</p>

<p>Also, I was also curious if there was a way I could use <code>screen</code> on the Raspberry Pi itself to connect to its own console port (virtually), I tried this without luck: <code>screen /dev/ttyAMA0 115200 8N1</code>.</p>
","<p>You asked ""<em>how to test to see if the serial ports on the Pi or the adapter</em>"".
It is difficult to test the adapter, as so many things are involved, but you can test the Pi serial  port.</p>

<p>You can check functionality without any external hardware.
Connect GPIO pins 8-10 which will cause an external loopback.</p>

<p>Running a serial application on the Pi and you should see the output echoed back. </p>

<p>Terminal <code>minicom</code> is a suitable terminal program for test. You should set this up for device /dev/ttyAMA0 and echo off. </p>

<p>NOTE If you are doing this at the command prompt you need to disable serial console, otherwise the console output will confuse things. You can do this in <code>raspi-config</code> or editing <code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code></p>

I downloaded Raspbian from the download location and then realized that I don't have a card reader to install the ISO. How can I install it without a reader? I've got a desktop computer and all other connectors such as Ethernet cables. Please help me on this.</p>
","<p>On a B, B+, 2B or 3B you can't do it without something to write the SD card. The only things these models can boot from out of the box is a SD card.</p>

<p>You may well find that you can use a camera or an older smartphone as a card reader (newer smartphones tend to use MTP rather than mass storage, so they are not suitable for this) to write your card.</p>

<p>On a model A,  A+ or Zero I belive you can use an appropriate USB cable (A to A for the A/A+ A to micro B for the Zero) cable along with the flasher utility intended for the compute module. You can find instructions for the compute module flasher utility at <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/computemodule/cm-emmc-flashing.md"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/computemodule/cm-emmc-flashing.md</a> . If there are already Pi boot files on the SD card then I belive you may have to be careful when you insert it since the Pi A series don't have the special circuitry to suppress the SD card interface that the compute module has.</p>

<p>The Raspberry pi 3B adds USB mass storage and network boot options but unfortunately they need to be enabled by setting a bit in the one time programable memory on the SoC. To set that bit requires a special SD card.</p>

<p>(note: the above stuff about the A and A+is from memory and I haven't tested it myself, nor could I find the references I remember with a quick google)</p>

"What is the highest performing hardware configuration?","27026","","<p>I know that exact benchmark numbers will vary between manufacturers, but in general if you only consider higher end flash drives, SD cards, and USB HDDs and your Raspberry Pi is connected to a network via an ethernet switch what is the fastest configuration from a network data transfer standpoint?  I'm only looking for answers in which people have actually tried the configurations listed below and have real results, not theory.</p>

<p>Obviously an SD card must be used because it is required for at least part of the boot cycle, but lets assume that you have an additional data partition on each of the devices listed below which has the highest network transfer speeds on the Raspberry Pi?</p>

<ol>
<li>The SD card</li>
<li>A USB flash drive</li>
<li>A USB HDD</li>
</ol>

<p>This question is non-trivial because at some point processing overhead associated with one of the storage devices coupled with ethernet communication may impact transfer rate, also the ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi is controlled by the USB bus so in general throughput should be impacted by the coordination of ethernet data transfer and USB media data transfer.  I do not know if the SD card is on the same shared USB bus as the USB ports and the ethernet port but if it isn't I suppose that would be a pretty large benefit performance wise.</p>

<p><em>Edited to include network transfer as requirement for benchmark</em></p>
","<p>In benchmarking you must always establish what your limits are. Because if you expect to get 100mbs out of that lan than you are only fooling your self!</p>

<p>Look at this Block design of the RaspberryPI Model-B
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUvNn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So we establish a very important fact here. Ethernet is bottlenecked by the <a href=""http://www.smsc.com/index.php?tid=300&amp;pid=135"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">USB controller</a> because form the block digram we establish it is connected to the USB hub. (No clear indication is it uses another bus or just simply USB2?)</p>

<p>Ohh look - another block diagram,</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Ye1z.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now that sheds even more light on the situation. The 10/100 controller is connected to the USB hub- unfortunately, again, no where on the spec does it say how fast the hub communicates with the lan controller-- expect for the key fact that is says the usb speed and lan are negotiated for mixed speed usb environments.</p>

<p><strong>Where is the SD Card?</strong></p>

<p>It turns out the SD card is directly connected to the <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BCM2835 (page 65)</a> and they go into great detail how performance is impacted from various configuration levels. One important thing to notice is that if the SD card has a dedicated Clock it can run independently of the core CPU/GPU at full speed.(of whatever card and standard is used - you can see it supported a few standards.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CbTS8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>So what does that mean?</strong></p>

<p>It means if you benchmark the faster SD card and crappy pen drive(4gb/8gb) you will most likely get massive performance differences. So now it raises the question, how does the CPU/GPU handle communication with this wonderful embedded device (usb/lan chip) and what speeds is it capable of communicating at.</p>

<p>You see how far theory can actually go before we actually do any benchmarking? Another key point here is -- How does the CPU control flow of data. Does it use the separate clock channel as recommended?</p>

<p>IN an ideal world you would think that this LAN/USB would handle it. But that requires a MCU.. do we see an MCY anywhere in that block diagram.. NO!</p>

<p>So the CPU has to request IO DATA send it the USB port then it goes to the LAN port (via the Same USB  HUB) Yes.. so that is going to cause some speed issues somewhere.</p>

<p>Also great thing to note what happens when you copy to a USB pen drive and from the SD card all via LAN.. it is going to cause some traffic.</p>

<p><strong>We need to benchmark various aspects</strong></p>

<p>In establishing what we are trying  to benchmark we can ask a real world question.</p>

<ol>
<li>How fast does the internal USB handle data from SD?</li>
<li>How much CPU is used to read/write to SD then to LAN?</li>
<li>How much CPU is used to read/write to a USB Pen drive?</li>
<li>Does copying any data directly influence the CPU usage?</li>
<li>How well does the embedded USB/LAN chip handle reading data from 2 sources back into the LAN port and does it affect the CPU proportionally?</li>
<li>There is no need to test if lan will get full 10mb/s because its bottlenecked by the state in which the USB hub is in. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you know what you are fighting for I challenge you to answer them your self.</p>

However I am running Jessie on Raspberry Pi and that it does not have a <code>/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf</code> file. </p>

<p>So can someone tell me where and how to set the default input and output audio device on Jessie. </p>
","<p>Ok, first delete the file <code>/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf</code> Raspbian Jessie does not use this config file like Wheezy did.</p>

<p>To find what address your device uses you need to first enter the command <code>aplay -l</code> this shows all audio output devices, and their address. For example, my USB sound card comes up as device 1 in the output which looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>card 0: ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA], device 0: bcm2835 ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA]
  Subdevices: 8/8
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
  Subdevice #1: subdevice #1
  Subdevice #2: subdevice #2
  Subdevice #3: subdevice #3
  Subdevice #4: subdevice #4
  Subdevice #5: subdevice #5
  Subdevice #6: subdevice #6
  Subdevice #7: subdevice #7
card 1: Device [USB PnP Sound Device], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 0/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to set the device to your default card you will need to edit the file <code>/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf</code> with the command <code>sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf</code> scroll down until you find the lines</p>

<pre><code>defaults.ctl.card 0
defaults.pcm.card 0
</code></pre>

<p>and change them to (if your device is also listed as device 1, if not change the 1 to whatever address it was listed at)</p>

<pre><code>defaults.ctl.card 1
defaults.pcm.card 1
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation: USB sound cards are registered as card 1 on Raspbian Jessie. On Wheezy they would be registered as card -2 by default and editing <code>/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf</code> would change that.</p>

<p>I do not know if this next step is necessary but without it my card wouldn't work.</p>

<p>Create and edit the file <code>~/.asoundrc</code> by using the command <code>sudo nano ~/.asoundrc</code> and change it so that it only reads this:</p>

<pre><code>pcm.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}

ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}

","<p>Alas no, it is not possible to connect a SATA device to the SD slot.</p>

<p>Unlike earlier flash memory standards like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompactFlash"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Compact Flash</a>, which essentially used a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Parallel ATA</a> hard drive interface (scaled down in size) to attach flash memory, SD cards use a 1 or 4 bit serial interface and (more importantly) a different <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#Interface"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">command protocol</a>.</p>

<p>CF cards spoke the ATA command protocol and were electrically compatible with PATA, so all that was required to plug a CF card into an ATA port was a simple adapter which mapped one connector pinout to another (like a microSD to SD card adapter).</p>

<p>To create an SD to SATA converter would require a small embedded processor with an SD card interface on one side, and SATA interface on the other and some software to translate the protocols. This is essentially what the card you linked to does, in the opposite direction, but that direction is <em>much</em> easier.</p>

<p>You only need to support the limited set of SD card memory sizes and it is much easier to map SD functionality onto a SATA interface than vice versa. As an example, SDHC only supports up to 32GB cards for instance, so how should it handle SATA hard drives which are larger?</p>

<p>Given how cheap USB to SATA adapters are, the limitations that would have to be placed on an SD to SATA adapter, and the limited market for them, it wouldn't be economical to produce such an adapter.</p>

<p>As such, I would suggest looking at ways to attach your SATA hard drive via a USB port on a powered USB hub attached to your Raspberry Pi. You will still need a small SD card to boot off, but these are also very cheap these days.</p>

<p>There is more information on this option in the question <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/1187/141"">Boot from external USB stick / drive?</a></p>

","<p>Turns out I was using retroarch-joyconfig improperly.  retroarch-joyconfig simply outputs the settings that need to be placed in the config file to standard out after you have completed entering the mappings. You need to take that standard output and put it in the config file. The config file needs to be at <code>~/.retroarch.cfg</code>.  If you don't have a config file, you probably won't have one yet, which is fine. If you have one, you may want to back it up to avoid losing your settings, even though you are just appending to the file.  Backup the (possibly) existing file with the following command</p>

<pre><code>cp ~/.retroarch.cfg ~/.retroarch.cfg.old

<p>Type the following at the command prompt to run retroarch-joyconfig and append the settings to the <code>~/.retroarch.cfg</code> file.</p>

","<p>This is not a direct answer to your question (hopefully you do get one) but a little bit of explanation that might help you to solve questions like this yourself.  It seems to me a lot of people are coming to the pi with little or no previous linux experience and this would be a good idea.</p>

<p>Operating systems you may be more familiar with (eg, windows) have a unified graphical desktop that is always the same.  There are no alternatives, so, eg, configuring the taskbar on one windows system is exactly the same on other.</p>

<p>Linux has no universal standard desktop environment.  The Xorg server, which is universal, provides the basic facilities for a windowed GUI, but it has nothing to do with taskbars, titlebars, various other widgets etc.  These are the domain of the <em>window manager</em> (WM) and/or the <em>desktop environment</em> (DE).  There are lots of both available, the more popular DEs that might be familiar from ubuntu, fedora, and so on include GNOME, KDE, and XFCE.</p>

<p>Some of them are very ornate, with animated docks, transparent overlays, multiple desktops accessed by a crazy spinning cube, etc. but that stuff would just bog the pi down, so the pi specific distributions like raspbian sensibly opt by default for a more simple and resource light DE; in the case of raspbian it is <a href=""http://lxde.org/"">LXDE</a>.</p>

<p>You can in fact install and use a completely different DE (or WM) with raspbian, I am not sure what is all in the repo (it has FVWM, which is my preference, so I have not looked beyond that).  </p>

<p>Anyway, LXDE has a <a href=""http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Main_Page"">wiki</a>, which would be a good place to look for answers to questions like this.

<p>From the ARM information center - <a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0464f/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cortex-A7 MPCore Technical Reference Manual</a></p>

  uses gated clocks and gates to disable inputs to unused functional
  blocks. Only the logic in use to perform an operation consumes any
  dynamic power.</p>

<p>Basically, the BCM2835/BCM2836 <strong><em>runs</em></strong> normally when this RUN pin to the IC is held to a logical HIGH.</p>

<p>It might be a bit difficult to see, but off to the left of this schematic is the wiring for P6, which you see as RUN when you look at the physical board.</p>

<p>During normal operation (leaving that connection open), PIN D15 (RUN) to the BCM IC (IC2) is held to a logical HIGH by R15 (pull-up resistor). When the P6 connection is closed, that same pin is pulled to a logical LOW (electricity likes to take the path of least resistance), effectively clearing that state to IC2 and resetting your system.</p>

","<p>Last night I've just built version 3.0.0-beta on the B version. It should be the same in a B+.</p>

<p>Below are the steps that I've done to build it from the source (adapted from: <a href=""http://robertcastle.com/2014/02/installing-opencv-on-a-raspberry-pi/"">http://robertcastle.com/2014/02/installing-opencv-on-a-raspberry-pi/</a>). Hope it helps.</p>

<p>Make sure your system is up-to-date. Run:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo rpi-update
</pre>

<p>Next install required dependencies:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui \
                               pkg-config libpng12-0 libpng12-dev libpng++-dev \
                               libpng3 libpnglite-dev zlib1g-dbg zlib1g zlib1g-dev \
                               pngtools libtiff4-dev libtiff4 libtiffxx0c2 libtiff-tools libeigen3-dev
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8 libjpeg8-dev libjpeg8-dbg libjpeg-progs \
                               ffmpeg libavcodec-dev libavcodec53 libavformat53 \
                               libavformat-dev libxine1-ffmpeg libxine-dev libxine1-bin \
                               libunicap2 libunicap2-dev swig libv4l-0 libv4l-dev \
                               python-numpy libpython2.6 python-dev python2.6-dev libgtk2.0-dev
</pre>

<p>Now the interesting part, change to a directory to put the sources and compile OpenCV.</p>

<pre>
cd /home/pi/builds/
git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
cd opencv/
git checkout tags/3.0.0-beta
mkdir release
cd release/
ccmake ../
</pre>

<p>Press <strong>c</strong> to start the configuration process. You may toggle some options if you like, my final options are below. If you change any option press <strong>c</strong> again to configure. Now press <strong>g</strong> to generate the Makefile.
Now continue the build process, notice that the <strong>make</strong> command will take several hours (it took 7h on my raspberry pi B model).</p>

<pre>
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
</pre>

<p>Here are the options settings used in the configuration step:</p>

Whenever I type startx at the $ prompt after login, screen blanks.
System appears to hang, finally returns error message</p>

<p>""xauth:  timeout in locking authority file /home/pi/.Xauthority ""</p>

<p>BUT
when I typed startx from Putty session, the normal screen display appeared on the monitor, normal GUI use was possible, using usb mouse and keyboard attached directly to the pi.
Logged out correctly, closed down properly.</p>

<p>HOWEVER 
all subsequent attempts from prompt on monitor and/or via putty now return the error message
""xauth:  timeout in locking authority file /home/pi/.Xauthority ""</p>

<p>Presumably the file .Xauthority is corrupted.
How do I fix this....</p>

<p>Have tried 
<a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/1329/problems-starting-x"">Problems starting X</a>
this did not help, since my problem is different and I already have screen connected.</p>

<p>all advice gratefully accepted, but please keep it simple since I am a noob....</p>
","<p>One possible source of this problem can be file ownership. You could try running following command:</p>

<pre><code> sudo chown -R pi:pi /home/pi
</code></pre>

<p>This should change ownership of all files in pi directory (and all directories inside of it) back to the user pi and group pi. </p>

<p>xauth application has a commandline option <code>-b</code> which is intended to clean stale locks if they exists so you could also try running (when logged in as user pi):</p>

<pre><code> xauth -b
</code></pre>

<p>.Xauthority file is not needed when X session is not running so you could safely remove it and it will be recreated next time X is started. But the message does not seem to suggest the file is corrupted so I don't think this can solve your issue.</p>

"How do I configure my sound for Jasper on Raspbian Jessie?","25852","","<p>I'm using <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/"">Raspbian Jessie (2015-11-21)</a> to run <a href=""https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client"">Jasper (master branch)</a> on the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.
The <a href=""http://jasperproject.github.io/documentation/installation/"">installation instructions in the documentation</a> seem to be for Wheezy and not Jessie.</p>

<p>Running Jasper on Wheezy works fine. But, on Jessie, I had problems configuring the sound. Either my mic worked but not the speaker or vice versa.</p>

<p>What needs to be done is, the default sound card must be set to USB because that is where my USB mic is connected and Jasper requires this. There are a lot of answers that talk about configuring ALSA via <code>~/.asoundrc</code>, <code>/etc/asound.conf</code> and even <code>/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf</code> but none of them worked for me.</p>

<p>When I open my mixer via <code>alsamixer</code> and hit <code>F6</code>, I always see <code>bcm2835</code> as the default card. That's the Pi2's default card but I want to make my USB the default card.</p>

<p>How do I do this?</p>
","<p>According to the <a href=""http://alsa.opensrc.org/MultipleCards"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""ALSA Wiki"">ALSA Wiki</a>, under the title that reads ""<strong>How to choose a particular order for multiple installed cards</strong>"", it states the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which card is card number 0, 1 and so is by default determined by module load order. This is particularly useful to choose which card becomes the default one.</p>
  
  <p>In theory therefore it is possible to choose which of several installed cards becomes card 0, the default one, by ensuring its driver module is loaded first. (Note: this assumes that each sound card requires a different driver. If you have two soundcards of the same type, please skip to the next section.)</p>
  
  <p>There are two ways to achieve this, the ""old"" index= option of the card driver module, and the alternative (and new) slots= option of the snd module.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It documents two methods of doing this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The older ""index="" method</li>
<li>The newer ""slots="" method</li>
</ol>

<p>The former is what the Jasper installation instructions recommend. It's also what a majority of the solutions out there talk about. However, this is the older method and may not work on more current Raspbian Jessie images.</p>

<p>A combination of both methods is what worked for me.</p>

<p>First of all, check to see what order your cards have been loaded in:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /proc/asound/modules
 0 snd_bcm2835
 1 snd_usb_audio
</code></pre>

<p>Counting cards begins from <code>0</code> so the default <code>bcm2835</code> is loaded first and my USB card which has my mic is loaded second.</p>

<p>To reorder my cards, I first create a file named <code>/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf</code>. It can be named anything you want as long as it ends with <code>.conf</code>. I then added the following:</p>

<pre><code># This sets the index value of the cards but doesn't reorder.
options snd_usb_audio index=0
options snd_bcm2835 index=1

# Does the reordering.
options snd slots=snd_usb_audio,snd_bcm2835
</code></pre>

<p>The comments should explain what each line does.
Once you do that, it seems you have to reboot your machine for it to work.</p>

<p>Once you reboot, you should be able to record some audio with the default card which should now be your mic:</p>

<pre><code>$ arecord temp.wav
</code></pre>

<p>and then play it, specifying the card as 1 and device as 0 which is where your speaker output should be:</p>

<pre><code>aplay -D plughw:1,0 temp.wav
</code></pre>

<p>I initially only added the line with <code>slots</code> in it. This worked in making my USB card the default card but it was indexed wrong. For example, once I did that, this is what my <code>/proc/asound/modules</code> looked like:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /proc/asound/modules
 1 snd_usb_audio
 2 snd_bcm2835
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, it should look like this:</p>

<pre><code> 0 snd_usb_audio
 1 snd_bcm2835
</code></pre>

<p>And that is why I also use the <code>index</code> method to achieve this.</p>

"Streaming H264 with Logitech C920","25646","","<p>I have a logitech C920 webcam. It has the ability to directly encode the video in H264.</p>

<p>I want to reproduce what was done with a Beaglebone, but using a Raspberry Pi: <a href=""http://oz9aec.net/software/gstreamer/using-the-logitech-c920-webcam-with-gstreamer-12"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">send a H264 stream to the network</a>. The Raspberry Pi is then only here to packetize the stream in RTP, the video compression is done by the webcam itself. The H264 mode is enforced using video4linux.</p>

<p>So far, and if I use a common computer with the latest version of Ubuntu, it works using VLC as a server or GStreamer. For instance, if I launch on Raspberry Pi a VLC server using the command:</p>

<pre><code>cvlc --sout=#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/test} 'v4l2:///dev/video0:chroma=H264:width=800:height=600:fps=30'
</code></pre>

<p>... and then if I read the stream with VLC on another computer, all is right.</p>

<p>However, if I use the raspberry Pi to send the video stream, the result is quite poor. Lots of garbage in the image as soon as something moves. Image keys are well received every 10 seconds, but in the meanwhile, it is not good enough as compared with the stream from a common computer.</p>

<p>I also tried the <a href=""http://www.oz9aec.net/index.php/gstreamer/473-using-the-logitech-c920-webcam-with-gstreamer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">method described for the beaglebone</a> with the provided <a href=""https://github.com/csete/bonecam/tree/master/capture"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""capture""</a> utility: ok if I stream from a real computer, same garbage problem if I stream from a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>It is not a network problem: I did some network checks with Wireshark and the statistics of VLC, I have no packet loss. I tried with Raspbian, and Arch Linux for Raspi (gstreamer 0.10 in raspbian, gstreamer 1.0 in Arch Linux).</p>

<p>I do not know if it is relevant or not, but I also tested with the soft float support version of Raspbian. An update must be done first to use a 3.2 kernel ; but same problem, the video has some garbage.</p>

<p>Any idea on what I could do to enhance the video quality?</p>

"How can I run the Pi on Solar Power?","25595","","<p>Has anyone successfully set up their Pi to run on solar power? If so, what would be the cheapest way to sensibly and reliably achieve this, using a combination of solar cells / batteries / voltage regulators?</p>

<p>Is it a case of just building panels that give the required current, regulating the voltage and supplying a battery backup, or is there something else I should be aware of?</p>
","<p>There are a few things you need to be aware of if you want to build your own solar power supply. </p>

<p>The main thing is that the voltage output of solar cells can vary wildly based on the incident sunlight (how sunny it is).</p>

<p>Simple unregulated solar panels sold as 'battery chargers' are often designed for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_cycle_battery"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">deep-cycle</a> 12v 'leisure' batteries, but can be measured at 18v or more open circuit in bright sunlight (even in the UK *8'). The internal resistance of the battery keeps that voltage down to the battery level, but without one the <em>higher than nominal</em> voltage could do damage to directly connected electronics if it isn't regulated.</p>

<p>As such, you should be looking at either regulating the solar panel or moderating it's output with a battery, and ideally both. Using a battery also allows you to accumulate excess energy production and supply power when power from the solar panel dips, which means that you may be able to get away with a solar panel sized for your average power needs, rather than one sized for your maximum power needs.</p>

<p>If you want to keep the size of solar panel and battery to a minimum, you may want to calculate the total expected power load, average power generation throughout the year and battery capacity to get you through the nights and the winter months.</p>

<p>There is some excellent advice about solar charging in answers to <a href=""https://electronics.stackexchange.com/q/20643/3774"">my question</a> over on electronics stack exchange, including information on how to calculate whether sunshine in your area is sufficient for your application for a given solar panel and battery combination, using location specific information from <a href=""http://www.gaisma.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gaisma</a>.</p>

"Controlling many LEDs with few GPIO pins","25314","","<p>I successfully completed my hardware ""hello world"" using this guide:</p>

<p>Now I'd like to move on to bigger and brighter things, more individually controlled LEDs that is! Obviously, the next step is to move the voltage source off of the Raspberry Pi and to add more LEDs, but eventually I am going to run out of GPIO pins, so I guess what I need now is to control a circuit which will somehow know, based on GPIO ""coded signals"", what LEDs to turn on and off. What sort of circuit examples should I be looking for? And more importantly vis-a-vis the Raspberry Pi, could it or rpi.gpio cause any problems, perhaps regarding signal timing?</p>
","<p>What you are looking for in that case is a <a href=""http://www.appelsiini.net/2011/how-does-led-matrix-work"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LED matrix</a>. You could control this matrix from the GPIO pins, but that still limits the amount of LEDs you can connect (the size of the matrix) and it might also start to draw too much current if you're not careful. </p>

<p>A better option is to connect a LED matrix to the I2C bus, using one or multiple I2C I/O extenders. That way you can create a matrix of a huge size (64 LEDs for example can be done with ONE 16 bit I/O extender). Another reason to use these I/O extenders is that they are a little more robust, can provide a little more current, and keeping your main CPU out of harms way.</p>

<p>On this site these I/O extenders are discussed multiple times, so you should be able to find info about these quite easy. <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/1997/can-i-make-a-full-usb-keyboard-with-makey-makey-raspberry-pi/2051#2051"">This Link</a> provides some info about these extenders and a matrix (although used for input, but basically it is the same idea but you don't use the matrix to scan but to steer the LEDs)</p>

<p>Only extra requirement for making a smooth working matrix is that you need to make the matrix not bigger then the RPi is able to update each individual LED at least 20 times every second, otherwise you'll start to see flickering, but this is also explained in the first link (paragraph ""Multiplexing and Persistence of Vision"").</p>

"SSH problems with Permission Denied (publickey,password)","25103","","<p>I'm rather new at Debian so please forgive me if this is a stupid question.  I have 2 raspberry pis and I'm trying to get them to work together as a proof of concept.  I would like to get them to work together and share computing power.  Simon Cox has published some instructions from University of Southampton that I have been following, but I've hit a wall.</p>

<p>When I attempt to run a simple C program to test I get the following message.</p>

<pre><code>Permission denied, please try again.
Permission denied, please try again.
Permission denied (publickey,password) .
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm sure the answer to this is just something I've overlooked or just plain don't understand.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and I'm sure you'll need more information to help but I don't know what.</p>

<p>Below are the commands I used to generate the key and copy it over to the 2nd Pi.</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C ""raspberrypi@raspberrypi""
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@192.168.1.2 ""mkdir .ssh;cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys""
</code></pre>

<p>I attempted to use the below command to authenticate the first time.</p>

<pre><code>ssh-copy-id pi@192.168.1.2
</code></pre>

<p>This asked for the passphrase like expected but when I go back to the original C Program I get the Permission denied messages again.</p>

<p>From there I ran the command to generate the key again but this time left it blank, with no security it worked.  Thinking it was resolved I recreated the key again with a passphrase.  Now when I attempt to run a Python program it asks for the passphrase and then runs as expected.  C Programs give permission denied.</p>
","<p>Okay, I had a look at the instructions you are following.  First, an observation: the assertion that <em>not</em> using a passphrase for an ssh-key is ""not such good security"" is generally false, as long as the private part of the key is safe (note the private half is never transmitted anywhere, due to the magic of public/private key pairs; it is just used by the local ssh process).  Using a passphrase <em>does not</em> increase the security of the exchange at all, a key-pair with a passphrase is 100% exactly the same as one without, in terms of the ssh connection.  The passphrase just makes the private key harder to use, should someone acquire it (eg, if they have physical access to your box, or have hacked into it somehow).</p>

<p>In the context of a number of pi's physically linked together, anyone who gains access to one will gain access to the others, so IMO in this context using a passphrase for keys used to log from one to the other is a tad silly.  Nuff said.  My point is don't be too concerned at this point about whether or not you are using a passphrase, you can change this later.</p>

<p>Also (this may simplify your life at some point), if you are using a passphrase, you can use something called <strong>ssh-agent</strong> such that you do not have to enter it all the time locally if you keep logging in and out of somewhere with the same key.</p>

<p>Anywho, stepping thru the superpi instructions: you've added your key to the other one as per #33.  Then, as per #34 you have verified the key is there.  There might be a complication here since you said you re-generated the key multiple times, and <code>cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys</code> will <em>add</em> to authorized_keys everytime.  This is sort of ok, except it makes it hard to tell if the last key you added, actually got added (which once you've added one it will be prompting you for a passphrase from an existing key if you use that method to add another -- which make it sort of not ok).  If at all possible, I recommend you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get rid of all the keys you've generated so far.  As in remove everything in ~/.ssh on both pi's.</li>
<li>Create a new key-pair (with or w/o passphrase) on the first pi.</li>
<li>Copy the id_rsa.pub half and rename the copy ""authorized_keys"" (no suffix), and move that into <code>~/.ssh/</code> on the other pi using a means that you are certain of, eg, by putting it right on the SD card.  You could use the superpi instructions recommended method, <em>but do not do keep doing it over and over</em>.  Which is probably why it is just easier to copy it onto the card or use some other such direct method, since you don't have 63 more pi's to do anyway ;).</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it for the ssh keys.  You can test this by trying to ssh in to the other pi:</p>

<pre><code>ssh pi@192.168.1.162
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing else.  There should be a little blurb including ""Your last login was..."".  You are now at a login prompt <em>on the other pi</em>.  It will look the same otherwise since the filesystem images are identical. Type <code>exit</code> to log out.</p>

<p>WRT step #36, which I presume is where you are having a problem, make sure you aren't still logged into the other one and try it.  If you still have the same problem -- well, ditch the passphrase if it helps.  It should not make any difference, although it could be that the python program you are referring to is actually not using the second pi at all (do you have a way to tell?) -- that would be confusing...</p>

"Auto-start X-windows / gdm on the standard Debian build","24977","","<p>I've built a bootable SD from the official Debian release.</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to get GDM to auto-start when the machine boots (like a typical Linux desktop)?</p>

<p>For bonus points, is there a way to get it to auto-login?</p>
","<p>Yes indeed.</p>

<h2>Starting GDM At Boot</h2>

<p>You need to edit <code>/etc/inittab</code> so that <code>init</code> knows that it should boot directly into runlevel 5 (default for X11) when it starts. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Beginners note</strong>: Lines that begin with a <code>#</code> represent comments. They will be ignored completely when the file is used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This section controls the default runlevel:</p>

<pre><code>## Only one of the following two lines can be uncommented!
# Boot to console
# id:3:initdefault: # this line should be commented
# Boot to X11
id:5:initdefault:  # this line should be uncommented
</code></pre>

<p>You then need to tell it what command to run when it starts runlevel 5. This section controls that:</p>

<pre><code># Example lines for starting a login manager
#x:5:respawn:/usr/bin/xdm -nodaemon
x:5:respawn:/usr/sbin/gdm -nodaemon        # this line should be uncommented
#x:5:respawn:/usr/bin/kdm -nodaemon
#x:5:respawn:/usr/bin/slim &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p>Now when you reboot you should boot directly into GDM. </p>

<h2>Auto Login</h2>

<p>After logging in run the command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gdmsetup
</code></pre>

<p>Select the <code>Security Tab</code>, click the <code>Enable Automatic Login</code>, select your username from the menu and close.</p>

<p>After the next reboot you should be automatically logged in.</p>

<li>Some DNS names servers – I’m using <code>8.8.8.8</code> and <code>194.168.4.100</code> and
<code>194.168.8.100</code> – which are Google and Virgin Media’s DNS servers. You should use the ones you have been told to use by your own ISP.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you have finished editing the file, it should look like the following, using the settings above:</p>

<pre><code>Description='Anything you like'

<p>Save the file and exit the editor. Try starting the network:</p>

<pre><code># netctl start eth0

<p><strong>Note:</strong> On my system, that always returns an error, but the networking actually begins working.</p>

<hr>

<p>After this, I can ping <code>8.8.8.8</code> and also ping <code>google.com</code> and in both cases, get a correct response.</p>

<p>If your network starts ok, without error, and works, then you can configure it to always start on boot by running the following command:</p>

The script wouldn't create the rrd file so I manually created it by using the syntax he used in the script.  I also modified the <code>UPDATE</code> command since it didn't like the value that was being passed to it.  I had to remove the <code>width</code> portion from the <code>GRAPH</code> command because it threw an error as well.  Then at the end, I added a <code>cp</code> so that it places the file in the images directory of the website and then added <code>*/5 * * * * /home/root/scripts/temprec.sh &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code> to my crontab so it runs every 5 minutes.  It seems to be working, but with only 4 samples so far it is difficult to know for sure.  Within an hour or so I'll have a better idea if my edits have worked.</p>

<p>Also are there any consumer device that we could scavenge a display from that would work with the Pi? Mobiles? Game Consoles? Kitchen implements? :)</p>

This is a ten-point touchscreen, which connects to the DSI connector and has full kernel support, after an upgrade.</p>

<p>Given that this has taken the foundation several years to finish, I doubt it is something that anyone could easily hack together from spare parts.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Serial_Interface"" rel=""nofollow"">Display Serial Interface</a> page says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Display Serial Interface (DSI) is a specification by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Industry_Processor_Interface"" rel=""nofollow"">Mobile Industry Processor Interface</a> (MIPI) Alliance aimed at reducing the cost of display sub-systems in a mobile device. It is commonly targeted at LCD and similar display technologies. It defines a serial bus and a communication protocol between the host (source of the image data) and the device (destination of the image data).</p>
  
  <p>At the physical layer, DSI specifies a high-speed differential signaling point-to-point serial bus. This bus includes one high speed clock lane and one or more data lanes. Each lane is carried on two wires (due to differential signaling). All lanes travel from the DSI host to the DSI device, except for the first data lane (lane 0), which is capable of a bus turnaround (BTA) operation that allows it to reverse transmission direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=64&amp;t=6450"" rel=""nofollow"">this forum thread</a> DSI screens will need new GPU drivers to enable DSI output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you manage to use the dsi connector (i.e. kidnap some bc engineer and let him produce a new gpu-binary for your dsi-connected screen) you could in fact have a working dual display setup...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, although official DSI screens are now available, and there is kernel support, it is unlikely that that such support would extend to arbitrary other implementations of DSI screens. Given what the wikipedia page says about the protocol, DSI is hardly a <em>smart</em> way of doing things these days (the protocol is complicated by the need to support displays without on-board memory) and it is possible that any given GPU binary may only work with a limited set of specifically supported devices, rather than supporting any arbitrary DSI display.</p>

<li><p>Any hardware hacks that allows to control the raspberry pi power management? (I have found SleepyPI to be expensive and was wondering if there a DIY solution or so?)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any other suggestion for software and hardware power management control to achieve low power consumption of the raspberry pi?</p>

<p>Thank you for your help in advance</p>
","<p>There are two primary things you can do to reduce power consumption:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Minimize the amount of power consuming peripherals attached and running.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize the workload.  A major consumer of power is the CPU.  When it is idle, it consumes less power.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That's it.  The pi is a low power device compared to regular computers, but not so low power compared to many mobile devices such as smart phones.  Unfortunately, there is not really much that can be done about that without adding more hardware.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the correct command to put the raspberry pi to sleep? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There isn't one because the hardware does not have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ACPI</a> or any other kind of power management.  It is either plugged in, in which case it is on, or not.</p>

<p>There are commands you can issue that <em>would</em> work if the device <em>did</em> have ACPI, but it doesn't, so they won't.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any hardware hacks that allows to control the raspberry pi power management?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, since again, it does not have any power management.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would it be possible to disable the remaining 3 usb ports only?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure that doing this in the first place would really make any difference.  It is like saying you would like to disconnect some empty plugs in your house to save power.  If there is nothing plugged into them, they weren't using any in the first place.</p>

<p>Technically that's not quite true -- the USB bus itself is a microcontroller and so uses power (probably a minuscule amount when idle).  However, I'm not sure that the normal recommended method for disabling USB power:</p>

<pre><code>echo 0 &gt; /sys/devices/platform/bcm2708_usb/buspower
</code></pre>

<p>Actually turns off the bus completely; more likely it just prevents USB devices from drawing power from the bus.  Put another way, I've seen various people claiming they do this to save power, but <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/8633/5538"">the only evidence I've seen</a> involves a LAN connection (the ethernet jack is on the same bus) and does not say how much simply unplugging the ethernet cable would have saved.</p>

<p>In any case, all the ports are on one bus, so if you disable that, you disable them all.</p>

"Detect if iphone/Android nearby?","24563","","<p>I'm working remotely and it would be handy to know when someone has gone out for a meeting / lunch in my office. </p>

<p>I thought I might be able to passively detect what phones near the raspberry pi (and then publish them to the web / dropbox / whatever)</p>

<p>What would be the easiest way to do this? MAC address detection? Bluetooth?</p>
","<p><strong>Much hunting - learned quite a bit - no luck detecting other peoples devices without much of a low level wireless scan - Bluetooth works for iphone if both are your own devices:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wifi scan might work for some devices, but iOS ones do not connect when screen is off!  My iphone 6 could be detected with simple <code>arp</code> command (gives table of ip and mac numbers of connected devices on the same subnet) but this would happen only when phone screen is lighted up.  Once the phone screen sleeps - it is out of bounds on wifi!  I bet this is in the interest of battery life.</p></li>
<li><p>Bluetooth dongle worked. No distance computation unlike some fancy algorithms out there - just present/absent can be done with very little power consumption on rPi and iPhone. Install bluetooth dongle on rPi as: (<code>sudo aptitude install bluetooth bluez-utils bluez-compat</code>). Figure out mac of your phone device by making it searchable and then do (<code>hcitool scan</code>) on rPi. Then connect to your device (make sure its searchable) as: <code>sudo bluez-simple-agent hci0 mac_of_your_device</code> and say yes on both sides. Then <code>sudo bluez-test-device trusted mac_of_your_device</code>.  Now they both ""know"" each other.  Then do <code>sudo hcitool name mac_of_your_device</code> in your favourite script to figure out if the iphone is nearby.  This will not create a connection - but just say hi to it. If it returns a name, phone is nearby.  If it returns nothing - phone is not nearby or bluetooth is switched off.  Compared to creating connections or other distance computation methods out there - this method conserves battery on both sides and keeps airwave pollution to a minimum.</p></li>

"Use an Android tablet display with Raspberry Pi","24411","","<p>I want to use my old android tab (dead) display with Raspberry Pi. I am thinking of connecting screen via I/O ports of Raspberry Pi. </p>

<p>I need to find display driver for tabs screen, as my Tab is dead, I can not find its display specification &amp; can not find manufacturer, Is there any other way so that I can move further? </p>

<p>Can extracting display driver from tab android OS help?</p>
","<p>It is not that simple, actually, its extremely difficult and possibly NOT even impossible. The LCD it self does not use a driver, the GPU uses a driver.</p>

<pre><code>OS &lt;==DRIVER==&gt; GPU &lt;==HARDWARE==&gt; DISPLAY
</code></pre>

<p>Take a traditional desktop. Your screens don't use an LCD driver installed on the OS. </p>

<ul>
<li>You install the driver for the GPU.</li>
<li>The GPU provides screen data on a standardised link, like VGA, HDMI or DP.</li>
<li>The screen receives the data and the hardware decodes it and pushes pixels to the LCD screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>The same applies in embedded devices like tablets, just the only thing missing, is the standardised link, because there is no point in adding more components for interfaces, since its embedded and not designed to be replaced by a bigger LCD, cause it wont fit, or to be used as a stand alone screen. The LCD is connected to the GPU in whatever way the GPU vendor finds it is best way to do it, and 90% of the time, non standard.</p>

<p>The operating system has a graphic layer which needs a driver to communicate with the GPU in a standard way, like DirectX but more like OpenGL. Then DirectX or OpenGL uses the driver for the GPU. The rest, is unknown to the OS.</p>

<p>Making things even more complicated is that GPU and CPU are usually embedded into single chip (SoC) with DMA access between these two systems. Meaning that the CPU must be running in order to communicate with the GPU, which requires more drivers, running on an OS, which requires a working tablet.</p>

<p>Connecting any kind of LCD <strong>directly</strong> to a Pi is practically impossible mainly because there are no specifications on what to connect where, but mostly because the GPIO is not even fast enough to deliver such data to the LCD - Since the LCD has a ""driver PCB"" which, is specific hardware to decode specific data for the LCD to operate. Trying to do that in software would be painful and a waste of time, since even the same tablet models, may use different versions of an LCD, produced in separate parts of the world, with a slightly modified GPU (very common in Apple device) </p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi has a CSI port, which is like their <em>kind of</em> standard way to connect an LCD directly to the GPU, but the LCD needs to support CSI (with additional hardware drivers), just like connecting a desktop screen requires and HDMI or DP cable.</p>

","<p>The firmware is closed-source proprietary code programmed into the SoC (System on a Chip) processor, which cannot be modified.

<p>According to the <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Software"">software</a> section of the <a href=""http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Hub"">wiki</a>, the boot order is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>First stage bootloader</strong> - This is used to mount the FAT32 boot partition on the SD card so that the second stage bootloader can be accessed. <em>It is programmed into the SoC itself during manufacture of the RPi and cannot be reprogrammed by a user.</em></li>
<li><strong>Second stage bootloader</strong> (bootcode.bin) - This is used to retrieve the GPU firmware from the SD card, program the firmware, then start the GPU.</li>
<li><strong>GPU firmware</strong> (start.elf) - Once loaded, this allows the GPU to start up the CPU. An additional file, fixup.dat, is used to configure the SDRAM partition between the GPU and the CPU. At this point, the CPU is release from reset and execution is transferred over.</li>

I'm leaving this answer as is though, since it can be applied to any generic GNU/Linux ARM distribution.]</em></p>

<p>Yep, Fedora 21 <em>[and more recently, 23...27]</em> works.  However, the pi 2 still requires a special out-of-tree kernel, and you need the firmware and bootloader, so you should start with an existing pi 2 image; here I'm using raspbian (make sure it is a version subsequent to 1-31-2015).  There's an alternative to ripping stuff from Raspbian, see the note about <code>/opt/vc</code> at bottom -- but using a Raspbian card at first is simpler.</p>

<p>The Xorg GUI server works using the fbdev driver, as it does on raspbian.  The repo won't have pi specific things such as <code>oxmplayer</code>, but they can be compiled from source or connived out of Raspbian packages (for an example involving <code>omxplayer</code> <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/54041/5538"">see here</a>).  For <code>raspicam</code>, see the <code>/opt/vc</code> note.</p>

<p>You'll also have to do your own kernel and firmware updates.  This is simple enough -- you just need the <code>rpi-update</code> script from the raspbian image (it's in <code>/usr/bin</code> and has no dependencies other than <code>curl</code> and the shell) or <a href=""https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">github</a>.  There is a slight potential complication with that, see step #6.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create the SD card from the raspbian image normally and make sure it boots.  This failed for me the first time and the kernel errors implied it was trying the armv6 kernel; ""bcm_2835"" was mentioned.  Adding <code>kernel=kernel7.img</code> to <code>config.txt</code> on the first partition fixed this.  Once it boots to the blue set-up screen, you can pull the plug -- that root fs is about to get deleted anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the card in another linux machine and mount the second partition.  Inside <code>/lib/modules</code> you should find a <code>-v7</code> directory, eg.<code>3.18.5-v7</code>.  You want to copy that out and save it.  Also get a copy of <code>/etc/fstab</code>. You can instead pull this stuff out of the downloaded raspbian image later (<a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/13137/5538"">see here</a>).  </p></li>
<li><p>Unmount the partition and run <code>fdisk</code> on the card.  Delete the second partition and replace it with a new 0x83 (Linux) second partition (this is your chance to make the second partition fill the card).  Next, run <code>mkfs -t ext4 ...</code> on that partition.</p></li>
<li><p>Download an image via Fedora 21's <a href=""http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/F21_Release_Announcement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ARM release page</a>.  I used <code>Fedora-Minimal-armhfp-21-5-sda.raw.xz</code>.  This is xz compressed, uncompress it with <code>unxz</code>.  The image file contains three partitions.  The first two are of no interest; the third one contains the root fs.  You can get the offset with <code>fdisk Fedora-Minimal-armhfp-21-5-sda.raw</code>; the ""Start"" number is probably 1251328 and the ""Units"" are probably 512 bytes, 1251328 * 512 = 640679936, so: </p>

<pre><code>mount -o offset=640679936 Fedora-Minimal-armhfp-21-5-sda.raw /mnt/whatever
</code></pre>

<p>Copy everything into the new empty second partition on the SD card (<code>cp -a</code> works for this).</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the kernel module directory from raspbian into <code>/lib/modules/</code> on the newly populated second partition; make sure you preserve the ""-v7"" subdirectory name exactly.  Also copy the <code>/etc/fstab</code>, replacing the Fedora one.  Edit that so the first partition is mounted on <code>/boot/rpi</code> instead of just <code>/boot</code>, and create such a directory on the second partition.  This is in case subsequent Fedora updates put stuff here (they will) which will never get used; the actual raspberry pi stuff might as well be kept separate.  There's a bit of a complication, though, if you are going to use <code>rpi-update</code>, since that writes to <code>/boot</code>.  You can either remount the first partition over <code>/boot</code> before you do that (and put it back afterward), or edit <code>BOOT_PATH</code> in <code>rpi-update</code> (but beware rpi-update updates itself).</p>

<p>See the note at bottom about <code>/opt/vc</code> for an option about keeping the firmware and kernel updated.</p></li>

<p>You'll probably at some point want something from what's in <code>/opt/vc</code> on Raspbian (and may be included other ways by other pi distros).  This is actually from a <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">github repo</a> which includes the firmware and pre-compiled kernels, so if you clone the ""firmware"" part of that repo:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware
</code></pre>

<p>You get pretty much everything, including all the stuff for the first <code>/boot</code> partition, and the corresponding <code>/lib/modules</code> -- i.e., you could create the card completely from scratch using just this and the Fedora image, and update manually with <code>git pull</code>.</p>

<p>[Be warned that this is 3.5+ GB worth of stuff.  Note you don't need to do it on the pi.]</p>

<p>The <code>/opt/vc</code> directory of that repo contains some libraries and executables, including <code>vcgencmd</code> and <code>raspivid</code>, etc.  <code>/opt/vc/bin</code> is in <code>$PATH</code> on Raspbian and you can do the same thing or copy what you want where ever.  What's critical is that the libraries in <code>/opt/vc/lib</code> are found by the linker.  If you copy  <code>/opt/vc</code> directly to the pi, as root:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""/opt/vc/lib"" &gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/rpi.conf
ldconfig
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise the stuff in <code>/opt/vc/bin</code> won't work.  The openGL ES libraries for hardware acceleration on the GPU are also in here.</p>

"Why do the Pi GPIO pins use/give 3.3V and not 5V?","23448","","<p>I know for a long time that people should <strong>NOT</strong> put more than 3.3V on the GPIO pins. They also give out 3.3V when high.</p>

<p>I did some research and it seems no one really bothered asking. Almost all of them talk about the maximum current.</p>

<p><em>If I am supplying the Pi with 5V, why are the GPIO pins not 5V tolerant?</em></p>

<p>Arduino pins more or less follow the input (or V<sub>CC</sub>) voltage. If it's a 5V model, the pins use 5V. If it's a 3.3V model, it uses 3.3V. Anything above those would more or less fry it.</p>

<p><sub><sup> I should probably ask Broadcom about this. </sup></sub></p>
","<p>The ATMega chips specify <code>Operating Voltage: ̶ 1.8 - 5.5V</code>. If you read deeper the operating speed is dependent on voltage. They work at 3.3V but you have to limit the clock speed. The <code>Arduino</code> team presumably chose 5V because of the ready availability of systems which use this (a legacy of <code>TTL</code>).</p>

<p>The SOC used on Pi run on 3.3V (and also require a couple of lower voltages). These are orders of magnitude more complex than the ATMega and run at considerably higher speeds (~1GHz vs 16MHz). Like most complex systems running at lower voltage allows higher speed operation at lower power consumption (and thus heat).</p>

<p>I suspect that the processor part and GPU run on the 1.8V and 1.2V supply and the 3.3V is for the peripherals. The SD Card also runs at 3.3V.</p>

<p>The Pi (especially the later models) have complex power converters which supply the many voltages needed at high currents. The 5V is needed because this is the USB standard (and the ready availability of suitable power supplies). </p>

<h2>How do I change <code>pi</code>'s username?</h2>

They are correct and I agree with them: <em>do not</em> power any device from two sources, a backfeeding USB hub <em>is doing the wrong thing</em>.<br>

<p>I think I have determined the problem, it is trying to run raspi-config but it isn't for whatever reason. raspi-config is installed at <code>/usr/bin</code>. The inittab file currently says,</p>

<p>Long Answer (Untested, Hypothetical): I have a feeling that this problem stemmed from buying a really cheap, generic SD card off of eBay. It appeared to be trying to run raspi-config but for whatever reason it couldn't find it or was unable to execute it. I probably would have been able to fix it if I was able modify <code>inittab</code> at <code>/etc</code> by changing</p>

<p><code>#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty --noclear 38400 tty1 # RPICFG_TO_ENABLE</code></p>

<p>to</p>

<p><code>1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty --noclear 38400 tty1</code></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><code>1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f root tty1 &lt;/dev/tty1 &gt;/dev/tty1 2&gt;&amp;1 # RPICFG_TO_DISABLE</code></p>

<p>to</p>

So, does the RPi have hard float support? If so, is it quicker that soft float? (It should be, right?)</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs"" rel=""noreferrer"">According to the FAQs</a>, the Raspberry Pi uses an ARM 11 chip with floating point support:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What SoC are you using?</strong></p>
  
  <p>The SoC is a Broadcom BCM2835. This contains an ARM1176JZFS, with
  floating point, running at 700Mhz, and a Videocore 4 GPU. The GPU is
  capable of BluRay quality playback, using H.264 at 40MBits/s. It has a
  fast 3D core accessed using the supplied OpenGL ES2.0 and OpenVG
  libraries.</p>

<p>This will be quicker than soft float (if it isn’t, I’d be amazed!), though on systems without hardware support it’s often a better idea to leverage fixed point processing if you don’t specifically need the range offered by floating point precision.</p>

"Why is a resistor needed for LEDs?","22323","","<p>While looking for a basic task to get familiar with the Raspberry Pi and its GPIO pins, I decided that driving an LED sounded simple enough.</p>

<p>While investigating how to go about this task I've noticed that most instructions indicate to place a resistor between the GPIO pin and the LED. The size of the resistor varies by instructions, but typically in the range of 260 ohms to 1&nbsp;kilohm.</p>

<p>However, none of the instructions indicate the reason for this nor do they indicate why they've chosen a (seemingly) arbitrary resistor size.</p>

<p>Why is a resistor even needed, and how would you know what ohms it should be?</p>
","<p>The reason is common to all LED applications, not just Raspberry Pi (or the GPIO pins).</p>

<p>An LED can only pass so much current before it will destroy itself (very brightly!). The maximum current varies by the LED's size and colour, but for a medium-sized red LED can usually be assumed to be 20mA (check this value though, if you have the spec sheet for the LED handy - and tiny LEDs can only handle a tiny fraction of this).</p>

<p>A standard red LED usually has a voltage drop of around 1.7v, and so the value of the resistor can be chosen to pass 20mA at (voltage - 1.7). Assuming an input of 5v, this means a resistor that will pass 20mA at 3.3v, which (using Ohm's Law) gives us an absolute minimum resistance of 165 ohms.</p>

<p>The worst that can happen by using a larger resistor, is that the LED will be dimmer than its maximum brightness, and so in order to accommodate smaller LEDs that can only pass 10mA, it's not uncommon to use 330 ohms and above.</p>

<p>I'd put a 470-ohm resistor in for a 5v supply for a medium-sized red LED, and if the LED is way too dim then reduce it slightly.</p>

<p>If using a miniature red LED, then 1K ohms does not sound outrageous, and for more exotic colours (in particular blue, pink and white), you will want to calculate the value yourself.</p>

<p>I don't think it should do this since the lease time is way longer than what those messages would imply. The question is – why does it do that and how to stop it?</p>
","<p>I did a bit more research and it appears that the problem was in <code>dhclient</code> itself. There are numerous instances of it being mentioned if one googles ""dhclient syslog DHCPDISCOVER"". I was able to fix the problem by removing all *.leases files from <code>/var/lib/dhcp</code>, purging (not just removing, but purging) <code>isc-dhcp-server</code> (which was not running anyway but this removed its  temporary and config files) and restarting. I do not know which of these helped but i would guess that deleting *.leases files did because the rPi configuration was for some reason duplicated in several of them.</p>

"Can I feed the device with a current rating that's higher than what's recommended?","22253","","<p>The quick guide says that the power supply for my Raspberry Pi model should provide at least 700mA.
How about the upper bound? Is it fine to use a power supply with an high output current, say higher or equal to 1A?</p>

<p>This is symmetric to my question: <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/71/91"">What happens if the power supply is 550 mA?</a></p>
","<p>Just because a power supply is rated (ie. capable of) a higher current does not mean that this is what the 'sink' (ie. Raspi) will take. This is different to voltage, where excess voltage can indeed damage a circuit that doesn't have sufficient protection (eg. voltage regulators).</p>

<p>Think of it with a battery. Most batteries are actually capable of quite high currents (albeit with a shortened life). However, something like a flashlight/torch will only take a current according to its design - and this is typically a lot less than what the batteries are capable of.</p>

<p>After saying all that, you should try to avoid a power supply with an extremely excessive current rating because such a set-up will prove to be inefficient in operation and uneconomic (relatively expensive to buy - although it might be one you have spare).</p>

I have ssh'd in from another machine and I was wondering how, if possible, to open a browser window via <code>epiphany http://example.com</code> from my ssh session and have it appear on the screen.</p>
","<p>Presuming you are logged in as the same user that's running the X display, this is fairly easy.  First you need to know the display identifier; if there is only one running instance, it is probably <code>:0</code>.  To check, use <code>who</code>.  You'll see output including stuff like this:</p>

<pre><code>goldilocks   pts/5        2015-02-16 07:18 (:1)

goldilocks   pts/7        2015-02-16 07:36 (:1)
</code></pre>

<p>The display identifier is in parenthesis at the end, in this case <code>:1</code>.  You need to set that in the environment of your ssh session.  For most shells including bash (the default on raspbian):</p>

<pre><code>export DISPLAY=:0

<p>Or <code>:1</code>, as the case may be.  To now start epiphany there:</p>

"How to disable local terminal showing through when playing video","22028","","<p>Any local terminal text (login prompt, etc) is showing through areas of the screen that are not covered by video (i.e. the black bars on the top and bottom) when I use a remote terminal to play video with omxplayer.

<p>I'm thinking that using omxplayer locally would sidestep the problem, but I can't verify since my RPi hates all of my keyboards. I also don't want to play video that way long-term.</p>

<p>PS: I wanted to play youtube on my old tv.</p>
","<p>If you get the same error as i got, try these steps: </p>

<ol>
<li>Start your Raspberry pi with the ethernet connected to your laptop.</li>
<li>Then see that your system is sending packets to the pi. It does not
matter if the pi is sending some packets or not. </li>
<li>Then remove the ethernet connected to the end on the laptop and connect to the modem
while its still running. </li>
<li>Run this command after few seconds( say 5 seconds ). <code>ifconfig</code> , you can see that the pi is sending packets
to your modem as well as it is receiving from the modem. (don't
worry if its not, you will get it in the next step). </li>
<li>At last set the ip address of your pi as <code>sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.X netmask
255.255.255.0</code></li>
</ol>

<p>I think this issue was because other OS(like linux  &amp; others) will set the subnet mask as <code>255.255.255.0</code> and send the packets whereas raspberry pi was sending it as <code>255.255.255.255</code> which would lead the modem to reject the packet for DHCP configuration. Check for the network by pinging to google or somewhere outside your LAN. This worked for me. Please answer if any solutions found.

It's also possible to <a href=""http://wiki.debian.org/TransparentEncryptionForHomeFolder"">encrypt files or directories on the disk</a> while leaving the filesystem mountable (but scrambled).</p>

<p>Either way, you'll run into an issue: Before using the clear data, someone has to input the key. If the key is stored on the card, nothing prevents an attacker reading the key from a stolen card. If it's input by a person, that person needs to manually enter the key after every boot.</p>

"Auto-refresh for Midori","21394","","<p>I'm using Raspberry Pi to create a non-interactive web kiosk - a specific webpage (measurements from a remote monitoring station) to be displayed on a screen in full screen mode, content refreshed frequently through AJAX.</p>

<p>Now there are quite a few solutions to making Raspberry into a kiosk, and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to do it just fine, but the kiosk should be quite maintenance-free. Especially in situation when power goes out, then comes back on, but somehow the router/modem/network infrastructure didn't quite come online.</p>

<p>In that situation Midori will come up with a page about ""unable to connect"" or something like that and it will be stuck like this until someone cycles the power again - since the webpage including its own autorefresh mechanism failed to load!</p>

<p>Now how can I force Midori to load the page when the network is available again, or something to similar effect (auto-refresh always every 15 minutes or so, or keep refreshing until the page loads or something like that.)?</p>

<p>If that option is unavailable for Midori, can you recommend some other solution?</p>
","<p>Assuming that you have Python on your system, there is an alternative to <code>cron</code>. I have created a quick Python 2.7.3 script which will reload Midori every 5 minutes.</p>

from time import sleep #Import sleep (allows an infinite loop to become dormant)

while True: #This is an infinite loop. This means that our script won't stop.
    sub.call([""midori"", ""-e"", ""Reload""]) #This forwards our command to the terminal

<pre><code>flexfb width=480 height=320 regwidth=16 init=-1,0xb0,0x0,-1,0x11,-2,250,-1,0x3A,0x55,-1,0xC2,0x44,-1,0xC5,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,-1,0xE0,0x0F,0x1F,0x1C,0x0C,0x0F,0x08,0x48,0x98,0x37,0x0A,0x13,0x04,0x11,0x0D,0x00,-1,0xE1,0x0F,0x32,0x2E,0x0B,0x0D,0x05,0x47,0x75,0x37,0x06,0x10,0x03,0x24,0x20,0x00,-1,0xE2,0x0F,0x32,0x2E,0x0B,0x0D,0x05,0x47,0x75,0x37,0x06,0x10,0x03,0x24,0x20,0x00,-1,0x36,0x28,-1,0x11,-1,0x29,-3 

fbtft_device debug=3 rotate=0 name=flexfb speed=16000000 gpios=reset:25,dc:24
</code></pre>

<p>Changing screen rotation is a bit tricky but possible. You have to modify value of register 0x36 at the end of init string (value 0x28 just after 0x36). In the example above there is 0x28, as well as rotate=0 below. This is for horizontal screen with power socket on upper side, touch inverted.
You can try these combinations:</p>

<h2>Reg 0x36 value | rotate value | result</h2>

<h3>0x28   |   0   |   Horizontal (power socket on top)</h3>

<h3>0xF8   |   0   |   Horizontal (power socket on bottom side), <strong>touch works well</strong></h3>

<h3>0x48   |   90  |   Vertical</h3>

<h3>0x84    |   90  |   Vertical (opposite)</h3>

<p>Above values are found by testing, may not be the best settings but works :)</p>

<p>This is my /boot/cmdline.txt file:</p>

<pre><code>dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait fbtft_device.custom fbtft_device.name=flexfb fbtft_device.gpios=dc:24,reset:25 fbtft_device.bgr=1 fbtft_device.speed=16000000 fbcon=map:10 fbcon=font:ProFont6x11 logo.nologo dma.dmachans=0x7f35 console=tty1 consoleblank=0 fbtft_device.fps=50 fbtft_device.rotate=0
</code></pre>

<p>Note: The Noobs distribution of Raspbian installs the root filesystem to logical partition p6 rather than the second primary partition p2.  The above change to /boot/cmdline.txt assumes the filesystem is on p2.  If you are using Noobs and you get a kernel panic following reboot after this change, log in using Recovery Mode and edit the line above changing root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 to root=/dev/mmcblk0p6.</p>

<p>and my /etc/modules entry for touch device:</p>

<pre><code>ads7846_device model=7846 cs=1 gpio_pendown=17 speed=1000000 keep_vref_on=1 swap_xy=1 pressure_max=255 x_plate_ohms=60 x_min=200 x_max=3900 y_min=200 y_max=3900

"Why is Python the preferred language for the pi","21179","","<p>Why is python perceived as the preferred language to control and manipulate  Raspberry Pi?</p>

<p>Why is Python language chosen over other other programming languages like PERL, etc. (which are included with distributions like Raspbian) ?</p>

<p>Question is not inclined towards any one of them but just trying to find merits over one another in relation to raspberry pi.</p>
","<p>As Ghanima mentioned in the comments:</p>

<p>Right from raspberrypi.org: ""The Raspberry Pi Foundation recommends Python as a language for learners. Any language which will compile for ARMv6 can be used with the Raspberry Pi, though; so you are not limited to using Python. C, C++, Java, Scratch, and Ruby all come installed by default on the Raspberry Pi."" So they just recommend it for virtually no reason at all. They kindof seem to have missed PERL on that list though but then again it is probably true that Python is easier to pickup on than PERL</p>

<p>The answer seems to be that they arbitrary selected Python, being newer and popular over other similar languages.</p>

"Disabling DHCP Server","21156","","<p>For some strange reason, my Raspberry Pi is acting as the DHCP server on my home network.  Whenever a computer boots up in our house, it's immediately told that the IP address for the DHCP server is my Pi.</p>

<p>I don't know if there's some way to prevent such an assignment outside of static setup (which is what our ""main"" computer is on now as a workaround), or whether it's something that needs to be done in the router admin page or in the Pi.  I would like to prevent just turning off the Pi because I'm trying to keep it open as a file offload server.</p>

<p>My router - Netgear R6200, firmware V1.0.1.52_1.0.41 - is on 192.168.1.1, and my Pi is on 80 - every other device we own filters in between those two addresses.</p>
","<p>You need to disable the DHCP Server so that it doesn't run on startup.</p>

<p>I don't have a box handy at the moment, but this command should do what you need it to do</p>

<p><code>sudo update-rc.d isc-dhcp-server disable</code></p>

<p>This will stop the dhcp server from running on startup.
If you have both servers installed, you may need to run that twice, replacing <code>isc-dhcp-server</code> with <code>udhcpd</code> the second time around.</p>

"What is the mmcqd process?","21114","","<p>I have a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Wheezy headlessly with all graphics-related software uninstalled.</p>

<p>I have bitcoind running, which is mostly consuming most of the resources. Usually, when I check the processes via <code>top</code>, I can see that only <code>bitcoind</code> uses a significant amount of resources, with <code>sshd</code> and <code>top</code> on second and third place or so.</p>

<p>For some reason, currently, a new process starts peaking in resource usage, called <code>mmcqd/0</code>. It often uses up to 55% of CPU power in peaks and stays at a constant of around 5% otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>What does this process do?</strong></p>

<p>I have read that this may be caused by a slow SD card, but I tested my read/write speeds and got >15MB/s for both (I got a 32GB class 10 SD card).</p>
","<p><code>mmcqd</code> is a kernel thread, responsible for managing queued I/O operations on the SD card. A high CPU usage from that process indicates that you have a disk I/O bottleneck.</p>

<p>The actual sequential read/write speed are not always meaningful for SD cards, random access is more typical for an Operating System. If you know that <code>bitcoind</code> is frequently writing non-critical data to disk, consider using <code>tmpfs</code> for storage of data. Then, using a cron job, you can periodically synchronize the data in tmpfs to disk.</p>

<p>You can also experiment with using a USB HDD, that should perform better with (random) write access.</p>

I already set the <code>use_video_port</code> property to <code>True</code>, which helped quite well but the time is still to long. </p>

<p><strong>Does anyone of you know how to take pictures in a short time (about 0.025s) using Python and the Raspberry Pi camera module?</strong></p>

<p>Best regards,
Simsso</p>
","<p>To take pictures in 0.025s with picamera you'll need a frame-rate greater than or equal to 80fps. The reason for requiring 80 rather 40fps (given that 1/0.025=40) is that currently there's some issue which causes every other frame to get skipped in the multi-image encoder so the effective capture rate winds up as half the camera's framerate.</p>

<p>The Pi's camera module is capable of 80fps in later firmwares (see <a href=""http://picamera.readthedocs.org/en/release-1.5/fov.html#camera-modes"">camera modes</a> in the picamera docs), but only at a VGA resolution (requests for higher resolutions with framerates >30fps will result in upscaling from VGA to the requested resolution, so this is a limitation you'd face even at 40fps). The other problem you'll likely encounter is SD card speed limitations. In other words, you'll probably need to capture to something faster like a network port or in-memory streams (assuming all the images you need to capture will fit in RAM).</p>

<p>The following script gets me a capture rate of ~38fps (i.e. just above 0.025s per pic) on a Pi with overclocking set to 900Mhz:</p>

<pre><code>import io
import time
import picamera

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    # Set the camera's resolution to VGA @40fps and give it a couple
    # of seconds to measure exposure etc.
    camera.resolution = (640, 480)
    camera.framerate = 80
    time.sleep(2)
    # Set up 40 in-memory streams
    outputs = [io.BytesIO() for i in range(40)]
    start = time.time()
    camera.capture_sequence(outputs, 'jpeg', use_video_port=True)
    finish = time.time()
    # How fast were we?
    print('Captured 40 images at %.2ffps' % (40 / (finish - start)))
</code></pre>

<p>If you wish to do something in between each frame, this is possible even with <code>capture_sequence</code> by providing a generator function instead of a list of outputs:</p>

<pre><code>import io
import time
import picamera
#from PIL import Image

def outputs():
    stream = io.BytesIO()
    for i in range(40):
        # This returns the stream for the camera to capture to
        yield stream
        # Once the capture is complete, the loop continues here
        # (read up on generator functions in Python to understand
        # the yield statement). Here you could do some processing
        # on the image...
        #stream.seek(0)
        #img = Image.open(stream)
        # Finally, reset the stream for the next capture
        stream.seek(0)
        stream.truncate()

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.resolution = (640, 480)
    camera.framerate = 80
    time.sleep(2)
    start = time.time()
    camera.capture_sequence(outputs(), 'jpeg', use_video_port=True)
    finish = time.time()
    print('Captured 40 images at %.2ffps' % (40 / (finish - start)))
</code></pre>

<p>Bear in mind that in the example above, the processing is occurring serially before the next capture (i.e. any processing you do will necessarily delay the next capture). It is possible to reduce this latency with <a href=""http://picamera.readthedocs.org/en/release-1.3/recipes2.html#rapid-capture-and-processing"">threading tricks</a> but doing so involves a certain amount of complexity.</p>

<p>You may also wish to look into unencoded captures for processing (which remove the overhead of encoding and then decoding JPEGs). However, bear in mind that the Pi's CPU is <em>small</em> (especially compared to the VideoCore GPU). While you may be able to <em>capture</em> at 40fps, there is no way you're going to be able to perform any serious processing of those frames at 40fps even with all the tricks mentioned above. The only realistic way of performing frame processing at that rate is to ship the frames over a network to a faster machine, or perform the processing on the GPU.</p>

"Which addressable RGB LED strips are beginner friendly and Raspberry Pi friendly?","20773","","<p>I'm programmer and my electronics knowledge and soldering skills are pretty basic.</p>

<p>I want to find a bright, addressable (a.k.a. digital) RGB LED strip which can be attached to RPi and programmed without any hassle in any programming language (although Python is not my favourite, I'd prefer JavaScript or even C++).</p>

<p>I want it a bright as possible, so preferably 12V, but 5V may be enough. It should not flicker as to not cause eye strain.</p>

<p>I'm confused about the controller options out there - so many different chips, different LEDs, different generations. For example, some options from Adafruit are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>NeoPixels, use WS2812S (older) or WS2812B (newer) - some comments on their website say that they might be not the best option for RPi;</p></li>
<li><p>weatherproof LPD8806 strip (but their older models might have HL1606 chip instead, so again I'm not sure how it would turn out);</p></li>
<li><p>DotStar, which is their newest model and has APA102 chip</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Besides Adafruit, there are other options, which make things even more confusing. Like <a href=""http://www.amazon.de/WS2812B-Stripe-schwarz-WS2811-Controller/dp/B00KGGPGB6"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>,
which claims to be ""WS2812B strip with integrated WS2811 controller"". Or <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/WS2812B-WS2811-RGB-LED-Strip-5M-150-300-Leds-60LED-M-Individual-Addressable-5V-/231105154168?pt=US_String_Lights_Fairy_Lights&amp;var=&amp;hash=item35cef0cc78"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>.</p>

<p>How can the stripe be WS2812B if it has WS2811 controller and is that better than Adafruit NeoPixels which have WS2812B only?</p>

<p>And also <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/WS2811-Pixels-digital-Addressable-String/dp/B00MYOCI9G/"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> which has only WS2811. It's not a strip, but still a pretty cheap option. This might work for me if RPi can connect to it.</p>

<p>Essentially, the question boils down to this:</p>

<p><strong>Which LED strips and chips (or their combinations) are the most hassle-free to interface and work with on RPi: WS2811, WS2812B, WS2812B with WS2811 (as Amazon claims it), LPD8806 or APA102?</strong></p>
","<p>You're better off with the APA102. Because they have a separate clock pin, the timing is much less critical; the Pi can setup the new data (pin 1), then clock that data in (pin 2). Then repeat. At its own speed.... I'm not sure how quick a Raspberry Pi can alter its GPIO pins... But at least it would work. </p>

"How to connect Raspberry Pi to a Western Digital MyBookLive NAS and create a link to it on the desktop?","20650","","<p>I bought a Raspberry PI with the intention of using it to play movies stored on my NAS, as well as browsing the web, so I will be using Raspbian</p>

<p>My NAS is a Western Digital MyBookLive on my home network. </p>

<p>It's configured to use DHCP, and does not have a username/password set up.</p>

<p>I've seen examples of how to connect to a NAS, such as what is outlined here: <a href=""http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2012/05/raspberry-pi-connect-nas-windows-share.html?m=1"">http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2012/05/raspberry-pi-connect-nas-windows-share.html?m=1</a></p>

<p>However, I'm a little confused about a few things that I would like clarified.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, </p>

<p>As per the example on that page there is a username &amp; password specified:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edit fstab file I needed to edit the fstab file to mount the NAS drive
  at startup:</p>
  
  <p>sudo nano /etc/fstab</p>
  
  <p>I added the following line to the bottom of the file:</p>
  
  <p>//myNAS/myShare /home/pi/myNAS/myShare cifs
  username=your_username,password=your_password,workgroup=your_workgroup,users,auto,user_xattr
  0 0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I stated, my NAS doesn't have a username &amp; password configured. What should I do in this case?</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, </p>

<p>One of the comments on the page states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My NAS is on 192.168.1.101, so the line added on /etc/fstab is:
  //192.168.1.101/PUBLIC/backup_raspberry /mnt/NAS
  username=USERNAME,password=PASSWORD,workgroup=WORKGROUP,users,auto,user_xattr
  0 0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this imply that I should be using the IP address of the NAS rather than the name of the device? Is it possible to do this when the NAS's IP address is assigned dynamically, as with DHCP?</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong></p>

<p>While that article outlines how to mount the NAS at Start-up, I would also like to know if it's possible to add a link of sorts to the NAS to the Raspbian desktop? If so, how? This is a partial requirement because my non-technical wife will be using the device to play movies.</p>
","<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>my NAS doesn't have a username &amp; password configured. What should I do
  in this case?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mount the NAS as a guest share, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -t cifs -o guest //192.168.1.15/Public /home/pi/Desktop/myNas
</code></pre>

<p>While this works, it doesn't automatically mount the NAS at start up. To do that, I needed to modify the file <code>/etc/fstab</code>, adding a line to the bottom:</p>

<pre><code>//192.168.1.15/Public /home/pi/Desktop/myNas cifs guest 0 0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>should I be using the IP address of the NAS rather than the name of the
  device?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case I needed to use the IP address because I don't have a DNS or any way (that I know of) of mapping the device name to the IP address.</p>

<p>In order to do this, I navigated my web browser to the configuration page of the NAS and configured it to have a static IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is it possible to add a link to the NAS to the Raspbian desktop?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Simply creating the folder myNas on the desktop, and then configuring <code>/etc/fstab</code> to mount the NAS at startup as outlined in Question 2, e.g. </p>

<p><code>//192.168.1.15/Public /home/pi/Desktop/myNas cifs guest 0 0</code></p>

<p>means that clicking the folder on the desktop opens to the NAS share.</p>

<p>It should be.  I've used a wireless keyboard/mouse combo with a USB dongle; that works out of the box with the linux kernel as configured on raspbian (and almost certainly other available systems too).  Just don't get anything too wierd that requires special drivers or something (a normal standard wireless keyboard and/or mouse does not).</p>

<p>Note that once you've created the SD card, the configuration is pretty simple and you can run it or update the things it effects fairly easily.</p>

<h2>How to investigate</h2>

<p>Since you can login via command line, you can easily access important log files which you should check for error messages. Login manager (I assume <code>lightdm</code>) logs usually live in <code>/var/log/lightdm/</code>, desktop environments should also keep their log somewhere in <code>/var/log/</code>. Check <code>man</code> to find out.</p>

<ul>
<li>reset permissions on your home folder: <code>sudo chown -R pi /home/pi</code></li>

","<p>Disk drives are distinguished by their UUID(universally unique identifier). 
You can find the UUID of your HDs with the command <code>ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/</code> 
Then you must create the mount points <code>sudo mkdir /MOUNT/POINT1</code> 
and change the permissions of them <code>sudo chmod 775 /MOUNT/POINT1</code>
Then you add a line to your fstab file (which is located at /etc/fstab) wich looks like that:</p>

UUID=12341234BLAHBLAH /MOUNT/POINT2 ext rw,defaults 0 0

","<p>That's not exactly a way to enter runlevel 1, but there is ""safe mode"" boot option in raspberry Pi firmware. To enable it, you have to insert a jumper between pins 5 and 6 on P1 (GPIO) header when booting.</p>

<p>If you do this, bootloader will ignore the <code>config.txt</code> file (except from <code>avoid_safe_mode</code> option which can be used to disable this feature) and will try to boot <code>kernel_emergency.img</code> (if available) instead of <code>kernel.img</code>. </p>

<p>Default <code>kernel_emergency.img</code> has special emergency <code>initramfs</code> build in and it will boot to this busybox based OS so that you can fix the problems in your OS manually (or change kernel boot parameters to run runlevel 1 at next boot).

"How to Stream Media from Raspberry Pi to iphone/ipad/android?","20214","","<p>I've just recently bought a Raspberry Pi with a preinstalled Raspbian 16gb SD Card. Unfortunately, I'm having trouble installing stuff on it, as sometimes the mouse+keyboard combo doesn't work with wifi, and sometimes the USB Mouse and USB Keyboard doesn't work with the Ethernet. Haven't yet connected to the internet with it. Tried the OS via an emulator (qemu) on windows, so know how to install basic stuff like rdesktop and remmina.. but since internet is not working, it's got quite useless to try to do anything on the pi.</p>

<p>Anyways, my question is, once the internet starts working, how can I setup the pi as a media server? I intend to use it as a media server over local wifi, and not just a hdmi input to the tv, what I've read about the xbmc server to be used as.</p>

<p>I have a 1TB external USB hard disk that connects and draws power from the usb source. So I think that raspberry pi might not support it, but I could also buy a 64 gb flash drive if the media server is set up properly.</p>

<p>I checked online for solutions and found two os for pi to support media streaming</p>

Along with a fix, I am asking to debug it to see what happened. KDMs answer also permitted me to reactivate the WiFi without restarting; whereas the other answer required a firmware update and a restart.</strong></p>

<p>I hooked up my new Raspberry Pi 3 and the Wifi was very easy to set up. However, about 1 week after this I could not SSH into the pi. My router's UI didn't show the RPI3 registered any more over Wifi. </p>

<p>I plugged in an Ethernet cable and my Pi immediately registered with my router. I SSH'd into it and attached to my session of <code>screen</code> and saw that my application was still running. This means the Pi never turned off or restarted -- only the Wifi stopped working. It has been about one more week and the Wifi has never come back online by itself. My RPi2, cellphone, laptop, etc. still have access to WiFi.</p>

<p>Aside from doing a restart, how do I fix this? How do I debug this?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Update: @KDM's solution, which use used on RP1/RP2 for wifi dongle problems, also worked for me (I believe this proves that this question is not a duplicate):</p>

<pre><code>sudo ifdown wlan0
sudo ifup wlan0
</code></pre>

<p>However, I am concerned that the WiFi stopped working in the first place. I don't want to have to plug in an ethernet cable and issue these two commands every week. I have two RPI 1s with two different WiFi dongles. One of them never had any issues at all, while the other one needed to be restarted every so often. I'm worried that there could be something wrong with the RPI3's in built WiFi.</p>

","<p>(Edit: good point, Matthew Moisen)</p>

<p>I had a problem with my RPi2 (with an external USB WiFi dongle). Ultimately I found a replacement adapter, but my solution (unfortunately, as you've discovered, you'll need a hardwired connection) to resetting it without rebooting the RPi was to restart the WLAN interface:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ifdown wlan0
sudo ifup wlan0

<p>I've subsequently swapped out my dongle for one which didn't originate in Hong Kong and I've not had any bother with it since ... even though it lives in my airing cupboard, which is not the favoured environment for computing equipment!</p>

<p>Edited again:</p>

<p>The other thing, I've just remembered. Try rebooting your router. I've never fallen foul of this with the Pi, but my android phone loses WiFi every other week and will not re-connect (even after a battery yank). There is an upper limit on the number DHCP addresses which my router can ""remember"" issuing. My suspicion is that if 10 devices all have a 7 day lease to run, the 11th doesn't get issued an IP. Rebooting seems to clear the leases. Suck it and see.</p>

<p>This isn't too important for most users and applications, but could be important for embedded solutions which are not permanently switched on.</p>
","<p>This is completely dependant on the Class of SD card you are using.</p>

<p>A Class 4 card, which is the minimum recommended has an average read/write speed of 4 MB/sec.</p>

<p>If you spend a little extra and buy a Class 10 card, you should find that the boot time is approximately 25% of the Class 4, as it should read at 10MB/sec.</p>

<p>Using finnw's estimate that 24 seconds pass while using a Class 6 we can guess this could be reduced to 14.4 seconds with a Class 10 device.</p>

<p>Do you still need the SD card to 'pre-boot' still, or do you have to format the USB Stick in a certain way? Anybody have a setup like this working?</p>

<p>See : ""USB and PXE network boot"" at <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pi-3-interview/"">https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pi-3-interview/</a></p>

<p>It would be nice to be able to swap in a test operating system like Windows 10 iOT or Ubuntu on a Flash Drive, rather than an SD card sometimes!</p>
","<p>I think the currently provided answer is inaccurate--or at least it will be.  From a <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pi-3-interview/"">MagPi interview with Eben</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""...The Foundation had some final input for Broadcom in order to add two new features: <strong>direct USB massstorage</strong> and PXE network boot capabilities. “Gordon rewrote the boot ROM for the chip and then provided an updated boot ROM to Broadcom, saying ‘shove this in the chip, it’ll work’,” Eben laughs. “And it does!"" (Emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eben goes on to note that while the hardware supports these features, it will take some time after launch for the software support to come out.  We already have ""pre-boot"" from SD, so what Eben mentions is something new.  It also makes sense that they would want to add these features 1) with all the SD corruption issues, 2) to keep costs low--why ask your users to by an SD <em>just</em> to boot, and 3) to help support its use in education--imagine a school lab with 30 RPI3s all PXE booting from the same image!</p>

"How can I use an iMac as an external display?","18885","","<p>I have to admit, the research that I've done suggests that it is not possible to do this (and that it is more complicated than originally thought). The Raspberry Pi outputs HDMI, and iMacs (at least those from mid-2010) do not accept HDMI inputs -- they only accept Mini DisplayPort inputs, which typically come from other Apple products.</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, HDMI and Mini DisplayPort are incompatible formats, and the only way to get from HDMI to DisplayPort is to use a <a href=""http://www.kanexlive.com/xd"">bulky, expensive converter</a>. You cannot do this with a passive adapter; however, if you want to go in the other direction (e.g. use the iMac as an output device by connecting a DisplayPort on your iMac to a HDMI television) then this is possible, quite <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cable-Matters-Plated-Premium-DisplayPort/dp/B004CADY9I/"">cheaply</a>.</p>

<h2>Basically, the iMac can be a HDMI output device, but not a  HDMI input device.</h2>

<p>Is this the case? And if so, does anyone know a workaround (that doesn't involve spending £150 on a Kanex XD)?</p>
","<p>You can start a GUI on the host machine, in this case your Mac, over SSH. This is only two steps, three if you count setup.</p>

<p>Before you do anything you need to install and configure SSH on your machine. You need to be able to ssh into the Raspberry Pi via your Mac.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Now you have to SSH into the Raspberry Pi. This can be accomplished like so.</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh -X username@hostname
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE</strong> You <em>need</em> to use the <code>-X</code> flag. This enables X11 port forwarding
  allowing you to view the GUI on your Mac. Make sure that you use the
  uppercase version and not <code>-x</code> as the lowercase version <em>disables</em> X11 port
  forwarding.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now you need to use <code>exec</code> to start your window manager. For example, in
 order to start LXDE you would run the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ exec startlxde
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>What should happen is that you should see the Raspberry Pi's screen on your Mac. Now you should be able to control the Raspberry Pi via your Mac and see what is on your Raspberry Pi's screen.</p>

"Installing latest Chromium with version 1","18878","","<p>I have Raspberry Pi B+ (version 1)</p>

<p>I have been googling and trying tutorials and suggestions for 3 hours or so, and I cannot for the life me get chromium that works with the chrome web store ( I think I need version 32+ of which the default wheezy is version 22)</p>

<p>I upgraded raspbian from wheezy to jessie in hopes that the version 42 (per <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=109309&amp;p=751381"">https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=109309&amp;p=751381</a>) would install, but <code>apt-get install chromium</code> or <code>apt-get install chromium-browser</code> returns  ""has no installation candidate"" even though my sources.list has</p>

<p>It seems the binaries don't exist in the repo? </p>

<p>I don't need raspbian OS, I just need something that can run chrome/chromium and can use extensions (specifically chromecast)</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong></p>

<p>There is currently no easy way to get a recent Chromium build on the rpib+.</p>

<p><strong>Options</strong></p>

<p>If you just want chromecast you could try some <a href=""https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast"" rel=""nofollow"">projects</a> that don't use Chromium because the rpib+ is RAM limited (limiting Chromium functionality) and has a less popular CPU architecture (limiting your install options).</p>

<p>If you really want a recent version of Chromium you need to find a package compiled for your CPU architecture or build it yourself. Note that Chromium builds often lack a lot of features available in Google Chrome (webRTC, pdf viewing, etc).</p>

<p>It appears the distributions of popular branches of linux available for the rpib+ do not have what you are looking for, but you can check all the options <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Distributions#Comparison"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Raspbian/Debian</strong></p>

<p>Looking at the URL in</p>

<pre><code>cat /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></pre>

<p>You can <a href=""http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/dists/"" rel=""nofollow"">see</a> that the official OS (raspbian) for the rpi currently has 3 versions:</p>

<ul>
<li>debian 7 wheezy</li>
<li>debian 8 jessie</li>
<li>debian 9 stretch</li>
</ul>

<p>apt will tell you where in the repository the files are</p>

</code></pre>

<p>allowing you to <a href=""http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/c/chromium-browser/"" rel=""nofollow"">see</a> what Chromium versions are available Though it looks like only v22 is available (looks like v42 for the rpi2).</p>

<p><strong>Pidora/Fedora</strong></p>

<p>Fedora does not include Chromium in the core repositories and <a href=""http://pidora.ca/pidora/releases/20/packages/armv6hl/os/Packages/c/"" rel=""nofollow"">neither</a> does Pidora.</p>

<p><strong>Arch</strong></p>

<p>Arch Linux ARM <a href=""http://archlinuxarm.org/packages"" rel=""nofollow"">only</a> has Chromium builds for ARMv7 not ARMv6.</p>

<p><strong>Raspberry Pi 2</strong></p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 2 has a more common CPU architecture (ARMv7) And you can get more recent builds from Ubuntu.</p>

<p><strong>Build it yourself</strong></p>

<p>Trying to <a href=""https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code"" rel=""nofollow"">build</a> it yourself will use up all your RAM and crash your raspberrypi (256MB) but this is the method you could use in <a href=""http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">qemu</a> or adapt to cross compile.

"Having an issue with Bluetooth Manager/Pairing on the Pi","18791","","<h2>The Issue:</h2>

<p>I'm having an issue with my Mac where if I try to pair it with my Pi using Bluetooth, it connects after confirming the code it displays, then after about 5-10 seconds, it randomly disconnects. I don't get an error, it just drops my connection from each device that I have paired with my Pi. </p>

<p>Here's what I am using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 2 Model B+ (Canakit Edition)</li>
<li>Plugable USB Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Micro Adapter</li>
<li>Macbook-Air Mid 2011, 11-inch. (Running OS X 10.10.3 <strong><em>to</em></strong>(*) 10.10.5 Yosemite)</li>
</ul>

<p>The software I'm using is <code>blueman</code>. </p>

<p>I don't know if this is a timeout thing with Mac or with my Pi but I can never get it to stay connected for more than 10 seconds.</p>

<p>(*) - The reason I said <em>to</em> on my specs of my Mac is because more than one Mac will be pairing, specifically about 20 Macbook Airs, all of the same model.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Updates:</h3>

<p><strong>UPDATE 28/3/16</strong> - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found a way to keep it paired. It doesn't make any sense, but if I go to the Blueman Bluetooth Manager and setup a new device under a group network, I somehow stay connected to the Pi. It never establishes a connection to the ""group network"", but it does keep the Pi and Mac connected. (Not really what I'm looking for though.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>UPDATE 29/3/16</strong> - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tried <code>Bluedevil</code>, as well as executing through <code>bluetoothctl</code> that @Chris suggested, but no luck. Started looking into editting the <code>/usr/bin/bluetoothctl</code> to bypass the issue specified in @Chris' 2nd link in his post, which got confusing as the line already existed when the tutorial stated it didn't, making me guess it was outdated. Will be trying the first link method later when I can to see if it fixes it. I did try to pair it with the Windows 10 side of a Mac Mini and I actually was able to pair successfully, yet when on OS X on the Mac Mini, it didn't pair correctly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>UPDATE 4/4/16</strong> - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Haven't been able to fix this problem. Also came around an issue when checking for an address nearby using a Python script, but my device I'm testing it with is shut down and the only way I can stop it from automatically saying it's here is by removing it from trusted devices.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>I am getting the same issues as you and it may be a driver related incompatibility at this point that we can't easily fix. Please read this report, on how someone has fixed it in Arch Linux for a specific bluetooth device (the solution there is on page 2), but this probably won't work for you:
<a href=""https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=197469"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=197469</a></p>

<p>To get more information and insight into the issue, you should try the following to connect your Raspberry Pi 2 to your MacBook Air:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open a Terminal Window on RPi2</li>
<li>Open <code>bluetoothctl</code> (it should show the RPi2 Bluetooth MAC <code>Controller</code> and possibly any paired <code>Device</code>)</li>
<li><code>help</code> will list all commands and <code>power on</code> will turn on Bluetooth if it isn't already</li>
<li><code>paired-devices</code> will show you if you have succeeded in pairing with your MacBook Air (I'll assume this is your MBA address from now on: <code>00:00:00:00:00::00</code>)</li>
<li>type <code>info 00:00:00:00:00::00</code> and check that it's trusted and not blocked</li>
<li>If the MacBook Air is not trusted try: <code>trust 00:00:00:00:00::00</code></li>
<li>Next try <code>connect 00:00:00:00:00::00</code> and check what happens, if everything appears fine check <code>info 00:00:00:00:00::00</code> again to see if they are now connected (probably it won't work, though).</li>
</ol>

<p><em>In case your MacBook Air is not listed as paired in the first place, make your RPi discoverable (type <code>discoverable on</code> and <code>pairable on</code>, then <code>scan on</code>). On Mac OS X go to the System Preferences > Bluetooth to also make your Mac discoverable. Try to pair your devices from the RPi - it should show a <code>PIN</code> on your MBA and you need to confirm that on the RPi. Afterwards you can try to connect with <code>connect 00:00:00:00:00::00</code></em></p>

<p>You may get to see these messages:</p>

<pre><code>Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.Failed
Failed to pair: org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationFailed
</code></pre>

<p>If you now check your system log <code>/var/log/syslog</code> you likely will find this:</p>

<pre><code>bluetoothd[379]: a2dp-source profile connect failed for 00:00:00:00:00::00: Protocol not available
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Where to go from here?</strong></p>

<p>First I would try to connect the RPi with another bluetooth device, such as a Phone, Keyboard, Mouse or Speaker to see if you encounter the same issues there.</p>

<p>Another suggestion you can try was suggested in this answer over here:
<a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/258074/error-when-trying-to-connect-to-bluetooth-speaker-org-bluez-error-failed"">https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/258074/error-when-trying-to-connect-to-bluetooth-speaker-org-bluez-error-failed</a></p>

<p>There is another path using <code>hcitool</code> and <code>bluez</code> to try and connect bluetooth devices with a Raspberry Pi over here: <a href=""https://dustplanet.de/howto-connect-your-bluetooth-keyboard-to-raspbmc-logitech-ultrathin-keyboard/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://dustplanet.de/howto-connect-your-bluetooth-keyboard-to-raspbmc-logitech-ultrathin-keyboard/</a></p>

I selected and installed Raspbian, and I used my Pi for about 24 hours before I decided to re-install the OS. When I plugged in my micro SD card, I deleted all of the files inside. I'm not sure if this happened before or after I deleted the files, but my SD card was renamed ""RECOVERY"" and it went from 8GB to only 1GB storage. How can I fix my SD card?</p>

<p>NOTE: When I plugged the card into my mac, there were two Disks that were on my desktop, one of them was titled ""BOOT"", the other was titled ""RECOVERY"".</p>
","<p>Simplified version: Raspbian partitions your SD card. The partition named <code>RECOVERY</code> is using the FAT file system. Also, it's usually the first partition. That's why you can open it up on Windows.</p>

<p>The <code>BOOT</code> partition is also using FAT but due to some weird Windows limitations, it can't see it since Raspbian makes a lot of partitions. Sometimes partitions beyond the fourth one won't show up on Windows. Macs don't have this problem since they're basically Linux and Linux is okay with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Your SD card didn't magically loose capacity. It's just being used by invisible partitions. It's also not broken, so don't ""fix"" it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To restore your memory card to its former glory, reformat it on Windows since Windows is usually aware of the card's real capacity and usually deletes additional partitions.</p>

<p>If it doesn't delete the extra partitions, you can use <a href=""https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/"" rel=""nofollow"">SD Association's SD card formatter. (Link)</a></p>

"How to access the RPi root ext4 file system by inserting SD card into a different computer?","18662","","<p>I've got my 4GB SD card full and Raspbian won't complete the boot process.</p>

<p>Is it possible to access the file system on a different computer (by plugging in the SD card) and editing/deleting files there? If so, how?</p>
","<p>Yes, the most obvious and straightforward way is to mount them under linux, where ext4 is the native filesystem.  Keep in mind that the raspberry pi is not actually the focus of the linux world -- not including android (which uses the kernel), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems"">between 1-5% of PCs (desktops, laptops, etc), 30-40% of web servers, and 95% of the world's supercomputers</a> run some flavor of GNU/Linux, of which Debian is a primary stream (and raspbian an offshoot of debian).  So that's well into the tens of millions of users and you have plenty of options to choose from -- most of which are, like raspbian, distributed without charge.</p>

<p>If you don't want to install linux on a PC, you could use a ""Live CD"".  This is an install disk that boots a normal, running OS from a CD or DVD so you can try it out.  It doesn't actually install anything unless you ask it too, and they are generally useful for doing recovery things -- you could certainly mount the SD card.  Most distributions, including <a href=""http://www.debian.org/CD/live/index.en.html"">debian</a>, have a live DVD (nb. Intel 64-bit architecture is part of the 'amd64' stream for debian; other distros call it 'x86_64').  You just download the .iso image and burn it onto a disk.  Note you do not have to use debian, and you can generally presume that any install disk you download will work as a live disk, including <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/try-ubuntu-before-you-install"">ubuntu</a> and <a href=""http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora"">fedora</a>.  </p>

<p>Running from a DVD can be a little slow but it should be fine if you just want to check the SD card in an environment that is actually equipped to repair something if necessary (mostly meaning: you can run <code>e2fsck</code> on the partition).  It is also very easy -- again, just download the .iso, burn the disk, boot it.  You can also do this with a USB stick.</p>

<p>Running a live CD doesn't allow you to save a configuration of anything, etc. however.  A popular choice in recent years, now we all have beefy multi-core systems that can do it smoothly, is to run a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine"">virtual machine</a> with linux inside windows or OSX, so that you do not actually have to install it to a partition or boot it, but you can maintain the system on a hard drive.</p>

<p>Finally, while Microsoft and Apple are evidently adverse to including ext4 support (there's nothing stopping them from doing so), <a href=""http://www.howtogeek.com/112888/3-ways-to-access-your-linux-partitions-from-windows/"">it is not impossible</a> to get it there (I can't endorse any of those methods as I have not tried them, but there must be something stable around).  However, again, you will not be able to repair the filesystem that way.</p>

"Getting image data from raspberry pi camera module in OpenCV with Python","18449","","<p>I am working on a project where I need to use opencv to get image data in python from the pi camera module. I have seen the tutorials on how to do this with C++ but not too much in python. I did find <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/17068/using-opencv-with-raspicam-and-python"">this link</a> which had me install the official kernel V4L2 driver bcm2835-v4l2. Once I did this I was able to capture the stream from the pi but the stream shows up tiny...probably about 5x5 pixels. I couldn't find anyone else who has encountered this problem. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Below is the simple code I am using for the capture:</p>

<pre><code>import cv2
import numpy as np

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(-1)

while(True):
    # Capture frame-by-frame
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    if cv2.waitKey(1) &amp; 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# When everything done, release the capture
cap.release()

  <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/38/prepare-for-ssh-without-a-screen"">Prepare for ssh without a screen</a>  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>I just booted my Raspberry Pi for the first time and can not gain remote access.</p>

<p>My Pi runs the recommended Debian image found at the <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">downloads section</a> from an SD-card.  After powering up, my router reports an unknown DHCP client to be at <code>192.168.0.142</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh -p 22 pi@192.168.0.142
ssh: connect to host 192.168.0.142 port 22: Connection refused
</code></pre>

<p>I do not own a TV and no digital display, either. How can I gain remote access to the operating system of my Raspberry Pi?</p>
","<p>One can start the ssh server using the <code>boot.rc</code>. Below is an explanation of how that works.</p>

<h3>Configuring the boot.rc</h3>

<p>Insert an SD-Card with the Debian OS on it back into the machine, you copied over the image on. The operating system of that machine should mount the boot partition which is the first partition of the the SD-card. If it does not try something like this on Linux:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>On the mounted partition you will find a file <code>boot_enable_ssh.rc</code>, if you installed a recent version of the officially recommended Debian image. Back this file up, if you will and rename or copy it to <code>boot.rc</code>. To ensure your changes have been written to the SD-card, umount it and wait for the safe remove to finish. When you now boot the Raspberry Pi with that SD-card, it should come up with ssh running.</p>

<h3>Finding the Pi and its SSH server</h3>

<p>To connect to the Pi you need to gather the IP address of your Pi. This can be done by checking the device list of a router, usually responding under <code>http://192.168.0.1</code>, <code>http://192.168.1.1</code> or <code>http://192.168.178.1</code>. If that is not the case, you can scan your subnet for ssh hosts using <code>nmap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ nmap -p 22 --open -sV 192.168.0.1/24

Nmap scan report for 192.168.0.142
Host is up (0.0094s latency).
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 5.5p1 Debian 6+squeeze1 (protocol 2.0)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at http://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 3.00 seconds
</code></pre>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>The interesting parts of the above output are the IP address and the port.
The IP address is in this case <code>192.168.0.142</code>, but can be different for you because it is determined by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP"">DHCP</a>.
The port is in this case <code>22</code> and that should usually be the case, because 22 is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell#Usage"">reserved port for ssh</a>.
With this information, one can test the ssh connection on the raspberry pi using something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -p 22 pi@192.168.0.142
</code></pre>

<p>SSH should ask for a password which is <code>raspberry</code> on current images; for the latest usernames and passwords see the section relevant to Debian of the <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"">official downloads page</a>.</p>

"Raspberry Pi and read/write on NTFS with Raspbian 5/5/2015","18354","","<p>I haven't stumbled across many recent articles or websites explaining how to get Raspberry Pi with Raspbian 5/5/2015 (and presumably later) working with an NTFS volume/drive.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the default behavior of Raspbian?</p></li>
<li><p>What packages do you need?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there post-package installation scripts, actions, or commands that must be run, created, or modified?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you only get read/write in the terminal?  Or do you get it in File Manager too?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>Raspbian 5/5/2015, the version I am working with, comes with read support for NTFS.  Presumably earlier versions over the past year or two probably have this as well, but much past 2 years, I don't think they do.</p>

<p>On a default install of Raspbian, the OS will automount your NTFS drive as read-only to /media with the NTFS volume name as a folder name.  This makes things easy to see, find, and understand. eEpecially if you're primarily a Windows user or new to Linux.</p>

<p>To get read and write access, you have to install some software, in this case, just 1 package: ntfs-3g.  Some older instructions may tell you to use ntfsprogs, but there's no need for that.  To find out the difference, see this page/article/question: <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/33367/which-package-to-use-for-ntfs-ntfs-3g-ntfsprogs"">Which package to use for NTFS? NTFS-3G, NTFSPROGS? [closed]</a>  There are no answers, but the comments are good.</p>

<p>Before you install ntfs-3g, you'll need to update apt-get.  You can do that with this command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why, but the package links for apt-get are out of date in regards to ntfs-3g.  Once you update apt-get, then you can install ntfs-3g:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
</code></pre>

<p>Then you will need to power cycle the Raspberry Pi.  <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/33608/raspbian-5-5-2015-will-automount-on-cold-boot-and-plugin-but-not-reboot-is-tha"">I'm not yet sure</a> why there is a difference between a reboot and a power cycle, but you <strong>must</strong> power cycle the Raspberry Pi.  That means turn it off, wait 5+ seconds, then turn it back on.

<p>That's all you need to do!</p>

<p>To test, in the GUI, I opened up File Manager, saw that the drive was mounted in /media, and created a new directory somewhere.  It succeeded.  If you had tried to do that before all of this, then that would have failed with an error message about insufficient privileges.</p>

"How can I get media files to display in a library style?","18270","","<p>I have a Pi 2 Model B, running Kodi on OSMC with the Confluence skin. I have all my photos, music and videos stored on an external hard drive, formatted with NTFS, plugged directly into a USB port. The files are organised into folders by genre, artist, album, etc. In Kodi I can see all the folders on the external drive, navigate around them, and play all the media. The music files correctly display the metadata tags I have defined when I select them.</p>

<p>This setup all works fine. However, the whole user experience is akin to manually browsing the file system in Windows Explorer, and manually selecting files to play. I was expecting a media centre O/S to offer a user experience more like a media library, e.g. iTunes or Windows Media Player. It would be nice to have all media displayed in a flat list, with custom grouping/searching/sorting based on metadata, not physical folder structure.</p>

<p>Does Kodi support this type of user experience? I have gone through all the settings dialogs that I can find, but I can't see anything useful. There is a ""library"" checkbox in the view menu on each folder, but it's always disabled. Can anyone either (a) tell me how to achieve this on Kodi, or (b) recommend another O/S that does what I want?</p>
","<p>I have got it working now, courtesy of the <a href=""http://kodi.wiki/"" rel=""nofollow"">Kodi wiki manual</a>. Media library features are only available when you explicitly add a video or music source as described in <a href=""http://kodi.wiki/view/Adding_music_to_the_library"" rel=""nofollow"">adding music to the library</a> and <a href=""http://kodi.wiki/view/Adding_video_sources"" rel=""nofollow"">adding video sources</a>. What confused me was that Kodi could see my hard disk without me adding it, so it didn't occur to me to search for a way to add things to the library.</p>

<p>A brief summary of the instructions:</p>

<ul>
<li>From the main menu, click ""Music"", then ""Add music..."". Select a folder that contains music files. You can add as many different sources as you like.</li>
<li>From the main menu, click ""Videos"", then ""Add videos..."". Select a folder that contains video files. You can add as many different sources as you like.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for all the metadata:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kodi will extract most standard metadata tags from music files, if present. I had already comprehensively tagged my music in advance, and it seemed to pick up everything.</li>
<li>Any missing music metadata will be automatically downloaded from the internet.</li>
<li>All video metadata will be automatically downloaded from the internet. Apparently there are no standard metadata tags for videos. See <a href=""http://kodi.wiki/view/Naming_video_files"" rel=""nofollow"">naming video files</a> for all the file name patterns that Kodi recognises.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I'd like to share a useful tip. I installed <a href=""http://kodi.tv/download/"" rel=""nofollow"">Kodi for Windows</a> on my PC, and plugged in the same external hard disk. This enabled me to quickly experiment with various music tags and video file name patterns to get the results I wanted. Once I was fully satisfied with my files, I transferred the drive over to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

","<p>The raspberry pi does not support replacement of the current RAM chip.  The current RAM chip is soldered directly to the top of CPU as a BGA package, that makes it very difficult to remove and/or replace even if you could find the compatible bigger memory chip.</p>

"Where is the kernel source for Raspbian's default 3.1.9+ kernel?","18093","","<p>The default kernel version of Raspbian is 3.1.9+.

"How to mount NTFS drive on a Raspberry Pi B","18070","","<p>I'm having problems with mounting a 3tb Buffalo drive to my Raspberry Pi B, the error I get is:</p>

<pre><code>mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda1, missing codepage or helper program, or other error
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried setting the file system type to both ntfs and vfat, both give the error above. </p>

<p>So what do I do to get the drive mounted? And how can I get it to automatically mount whenever the Raspberry Pi boots?</p>
","<p>By default is you use <code>ntfs</code> it will be the kernel module which allow read-only mount of NTFS partitions.</p>

<p>As this is failing are you sure NTFS is the filesystem of your drive? What does Windows or OS X says when you plug it in one of those? You can check on Raspbian using this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo file -s /dev/sda1
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, in case you want read/write NTFS, you need NTFS-3g but I'm not sure if this driverdriver is installed by default on Raspbian. So first make sure you have it:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
</code></pre>

<p>Then if your USB drive partition is really <code>/dev/sda1</code>, you should do (assuming you are mounting it on <code>/mnt/usb</code> which should be a valid folder)</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb
</code></pre>

<p>An alternative to the above command is:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb

"Properly wiring a solid-state relay to the GPIO pins?","18028","","<p>tl;dr &mdash; I'd like to connect <a href=""http://www.sainsmart.com/8-channel-5v-solid-state-relay-module-board-omron-ssr-4-pic-arm-avr-dsp-arduino.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this relay</a> to the GPIO pins on my Raspberry Pi B+.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm looking into purchasing a solid-state relay for my Raspberry Pi. After a great deal of searching, I came across this 8-channel relay from Sainsmart:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sainsmart.com/8-channel-5v-solid-state-relay-module-board-omron-ssr-4-pic-arm-avr-dsp-arduino.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zksYF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>However, I'm not exactly sure how to connect it to the Pi. <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#General_Purpose_Input.2FOutput_.28GPIO.29"" rel=""noreferrer"">This page</a> provides a list of each of the pins. If I understand correctly, the GPIO pins provide 50 mA at 3.3V. There are also a couple of GPIO pins that provide 5V. According to the specifications for the relay, 3.3V should be enough to activate a channel.</p>

<p>Based on my extremely limited knowledge, I have come up with this wiring diagram:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V98Ji.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V98Ji.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Is this correct? Am I missing something? Any advice is greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>Your wiring diagram is correct, as (per the Sainsmart.com website you linked) the specs of the device are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Input control signal voltage:</p>

<pre><code>0V - 0.5V Low stage (SSR is OFF),
0.5V – 2.5V (unknown state).
2.5V - 20V High state (SSR is ON).
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The Raspberry Pi uses 3V3 signals on its GPIO pins; a voltage level which is high enough to trigger the High State in the relay as per the specs. An Arduino (for which the same board is used) uses 5V signals on its GPIO pins and works equally fine with this board. The other circuitry on the board needs to be powered by a 5V source, for which you have correctly wired the board to the 5V power supply pin on the GPIO header.</p>

<p>The specs you quote are not completely correct, however. The GPIO header consists of power supply pins (1x 3V3 and 2x5V), several Ground pins, as well as GPIO pins. The GPIO pins (like GPIO17 you mention) are severely limited in the current they can supply (unlike the 5V pins which can supply at least 0.5A if not more depending on the rPi model). Each pin can output a maximum of 16mA (not 50mA as you mention), with a total maximum combined current across all pins of 50mA. This is enough to drive a few LEDs, but not much more. The pins are typically used for sending signals to other devices, and your relay is a perfect example.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, your circuit will work fine as you drew it (provided you supply a different power source to the relay terminals, the Sainsmart page says this about the Relay voltage and current it supports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SSR Output (each channel):</p>

<pre><code> Load voltage range: 75 to 264V AC (50/60Hz).
 Load current: 0.1 to 2 AMP.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>). It is common practice to put at least a resistor on the line between GPIO17 and the relay (1kOhm should be enough) to avoid a short circuit from frying your rPi via the GPIO pin. Also, if you want to be extremely safe, you can prevent an accidental miswiring from sending current to your output GPIO17 by wiring in a diode (make sure the polarity is right on the diode!).</p>

<p>Finally, since you are new to this, be extremely careful how you tap into the GPIO pins, especially the 5V pin. If you use proper female jumper wires there should be no issue, but if you decide to work with stripped wire on the GPIO end, you might end up inadvertently connecting the 5V pin with a GPIO pin, which leads to disaster (As I call it - ""fried Pi""). Then - set your GPIO pin to be ""output"" (in whatever language/library you are using), and engage the builtin pull-down register (to make sure that when the signal ""floats"" it gets pulled down to 0V and doesn't accidentally trigger the relay).</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>PS: The video on the Sainsmart page is not much help, the only useful thing to observe is that in the demo they have the relay powered from a separate 5V supply instead of using the rPi's 5V GPIO pin. According to the specs, the board will only use 160mA, which is well below what the rPi can supply. So you're good either way. The Sainsmart page also has a Raspberry Pi ""document"" linked, but that page (<a href=""https://github.com/fixedd/RPi_Relay_Interface#readme"">https://github.com/fixedd/RPi_Relay_Interface#readme</a>) has a disclaimer saying that its instructions are unnecessary for the Sainsmart module, as (quoting):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note / Warning</p>
  
  <p>This was formerly stated to be for the SainSmart relay modules, but it
  was later pointed out to me that these boards actually already have
  this logic built in to them.</p>

<p>-----NOTE-----<br>
The picture below shows that MySQL-server is already installed and of the latest version. This is just because I took the screen shot after a recent failure and had run the install command again so I could replicate the error for the screenshot. With each attempt to try a different fix I have completely remove MySQL-server and all of it's dependencies.<br>
-----NOTE-----

<p>So then I tried to run (sudo dpkg --configure mysql-server-5.5) and (sudo apt-get install -f) to try and fix the pakage and then tried to run (sudo apt-get install mysql-server) once more. I got the same errors. So then I compleately removed everything, including the folders created by the setup and tried to install from a tarball. That pretty much led me to the same place as before. I've looked through dozens of forums trying to find an answer but all the issues I found with PI and mysql had to do with a conflict with an older firmware. Does anyone have any suggestions for me?</p>

<p>-----UPDATE 3/4/15 9:16PM-----</p>

"How can I protect against intrusion and malware before connecting it to the internet (especially on a public IP address)?","17721","","<p>With the large number of Raspberry Pis in the wild, and the fact that large groups of them are configured identically (when a newly-flashed SD card is installed with one of the few available images), they are likely to be a tempting target for malware, including botnets.</p>

<p>What can be done to mitigate this?</p>

<p>It is reasonably well known that one should change the password for the ""pi"" user (Debian) and ""root"" (Arch.)  But how about other system accounts (e.g. ""tli"", ""pnd""?)  Do any of them have universal passwords that are presumably the same for all units?</p>

<p>And are there any known vulnerabilities in other packages that are installed in the SD images available for the Pi (e.g. because of hardware limitations, or cut-down versions of those packages?)</p>

<p>In particular I am worried about <code>ssh</code>, mysql and any other services that may be running on a newly-installed image.</p>
","<p>Things I've noticed so far about the stock Debian Squeeze image:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>/etc/shadow contains a bunch of password hashes for accounts that aren't the pi account (buildbot, etc). Change the password on the pi account, naturally, if you haven't already (or make a new user account for yourself and delete the pi account) but also edit the other entries and replace the hashes with *s. Note /etc/passwd contains duplicate entries for the pi account, which confuses the hell out of adduser / deluser, just delete one.</p></li>
<li><p>the default ssh daemon configuration permits remote root login. This should be disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>worth using netstat to check the set of things listening for connections; a surprising amount of stuff is running compared to a typical minimal Debian netinst. It's generally a good idea to reduce exposure to just the things you <em>need</em>, so first either disable or firewall off <em>everything</em>, then expose just the services you deliberately want visible on the public internet (typically just ssh or ssh+http).</p></li>
<li><p>you'll want to change the ssh host keys rather than using the ones in the image (AIUI the latest image actually regenerates them on first boot)</p></li>

"How to change the default governor?","17503","","<p>I want to change the default governor on my pi from ondemand to performance. Is there a way of doing this?</p>
","<p>I don't think you can change the <em>default</em> without recompiling the kernel.  By that I mean, the one the kernel chooses when booted up.</p>

<p>However, you can tell it to use a different governor while running, so if you want to effectively set the default without recompiling, you can add something to <code>/etc/rc.local</code> or some other start-up script.</p>

<p>The <code>/sys</code> directory is not on disk; it's an in RAM fake filesystem that is actually an interface for getting information from and sending commands to the kernel.  This is all relative to <code>/sys/devices/system/cpu</code>, so:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
</code></pre>

<p>You also need to be root to do the writes (<code>echo blahblah &gt;</code>).  Anyway, relative to the above directory, to see the available governors:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; cat cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently yours is <code>ondemand</code> (but read <strong>""Gotcha""</strong> below about this); to check:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; cat cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
ondemand
</code></pre>

<p>To change it (note this has to be done root, <code>sudo</code> will not work because there is a redirect, <code>&gt;</code>):</p>

<pre><code>echo performance &gt; cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
</code></pre>

<p>You'll now notice the <code>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq</code> directory, (NOT the same as <code>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq</code>!), which formerly contained filehandles for configuring the ondemand governor, is empty.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Gotcha...</h1>

<p>On Raspbian there is an init script, the confusingly named <code>raspi-config</code> (no, it has nothing to do with the other one, which is run on first boot by the also confusingly named <code>apply_noobs_os_config.sh</code>), which uses this technique to set the governor to <code>ondemand</code> unless the shift key is held down (the stock Raspbian kernel has <code>powersave</code> compiled in).  It doesn't do anything else, so it is safe to disable this (<code>systemctl disable raspi-config</code>), or you could edit it as per <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/60451/5538"">Gorkamorka's answer</a>, but then you run the risk of having it un-edited by a system update, etc. -- who knows what anyone plans to do with that. </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Make sure ALSA is configured correctly with good defaults for the RasPi hardware. The <code>/home/pi/.asoundrc</code> file should contain:</p>

<pre><code>pcm.mmap0 {
    type mmap_emul;
    slave {
      pcm ""hw:0,0"";
    }
}

pcm.!default {
   type hw;
   card 0;
}

ctl.!default {
   type hw;
   card 0;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Possible Problem #3:</strong> Wrong hardware output device chosen by <code>aplay</code></p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check what devices are available using <code>aplay -l</code></p>

<p>Run <code>aplay -l</code> to list playback devices detected, you should see something like this that references <code>bcm2835</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA], device 0: bcm2835 ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA]
  Subdevices: 8/8
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
  Subdevice #1: subdevice #1
  Subdevice #2: subdevice #2
  Subdevice #3: subdevice #3
  Subdevice #4: subdevice #4
  Subdevice #5: subdevice #5
  Subdevice #6: subdevice #6
  Subdevice #7: subdevice #7
card 0: ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA], device 1: bcm2835 ALSA [bcm2835 IEC958/HDMI]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
</code></pre>

<p>If you're trying to test the headphone out, you'd force usage of it with:</p>

<pre><code>aplay -Dhw:0,0 test.wav # 'try playing test.wav using hardware card 0, subdevice 0 (headphones)
</code></pre>

<p>Then, if you'd like to change the default for your Raspberry Pi, adjust your <code>.asoundrc</code> file to use the right hardware card index #.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Possible Problem 4:</strong> Your sound is simply muted/too low and you need to turn it up.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Make sure <code>alsa-utils</code> is installed and run <code>alsamixer</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y alsa-utils
alsamixer
</code></pre>

<p>Then use the F1-F6 keys and UI to push up the volume.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RbWfj.jpg"" alt=""alsamixer""></p>

<p>Use the arrow keys to jack up the volume and quit.</p>

<p>To save what you changed in <code>alsamixer</code> as defaults, do:</p>

<pre><code>sudo alsactl store 0
</code></pre>

</blockquote>

<p>There are three main sources of heat - </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The input voltage regulator (bottom left). </p>

<p>This regulates the input down from Vcc to 5V. Assuming this is a linear regulator, power dissipation will equal <code>P=(Vcc-5)*I</code>, where <code>I</code> is the current usage of the device. </p>

<p>If you supply the board with 6V, and draw 0.5A, the power dissipated by this chip will be (6-5)*0.5 = 0.5W.</p></li>
<li><p>SoC BCM2835 (middle). This contains the ARM11 CPU, GPU and RAM. </p></li>

"How to build custom OS for Raspberry pi from scratch?","17340","","<p>I am new to kernel and embedded Linux. I have recently bought a Raspberry Pi and booted it using the Raspbian. I was fascinated by the Pi, to learn more on Embedded I have decided to make an home automation system. I wanted to use my own kernel, and stack. ie I don't want to use any of the OS.</p>

<p>For that I have download Kernel, target_fs, firmware, and tool-chain from the official github. I have compiled the kernel using the tool-chain.</p>

<p>Now I don't know how to put this to a new sdcard (formatted for a fresh start). What all things I have to take care before booting my stack? Since I have not put ssh or telnet server/Client, how can i know the boot was successful. Where can I get a ssh/telnet daemon for the pi? My aim is to boot only the kernel(or bare minimum) in the Raspberry Pi.</p>
","<p>The kernel expects two things: a root filesystem, and an <code>init</code> daemon that resides on it.  The init included with raspbian is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init#SysV-style"">sysV style</a> system.  You are not tied to that -- other init systems commonly used with linux (remember: <em>the kernel <strong>is</strong> linux</em>) are <code>systemd</code> and <code>upstart</code> -- but <strong>you do need an init system of some sort.</strong></p>

<p>You can also put <code>init</code> in an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initramfs"">initramfs</a> and have it <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt"">built into the kernel</a>, in which case you could get away without a root filesystem, but that seems pointless in this case. </p>

<p><code>init</code> is the only userland application started by the kernel.  Normally, it then starts processes which open ttys with a login, and then other services that may start a display manager, sshd, etc.  You may not need the login, but you probably want the tty; you could also just start sshd directly instead. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where can i get a ssh/telnet daemon for the pi?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get it from the same place raspbian did, the upstream source.  <strong>None of this stuff was written specifically for the pi.</strong>  Or at least, very very little of it.  It's been used on a huge variety of different systems.  </p>

<p>If you want one pre-compiled for the pi...well, that's raspbian, etc.<sup>1</sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i don't know how to put this to a new sdcard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll have to use the pi-specific bootloader which is in the <code>/boot</code> partition of the raspbian image.</p>

<p><sup>1. To be brutally honest, I think you are on a massively quixotic quest that, based on the knowledge implied by your question, you have virtually no hope of accomplishing this year unless you quit your job and devote yourself to learning full time, and even then your chance of failure is very high and it will take you <em>months</em> to reach a point where you have any chance of success.  It is not simple.  It is not easy.  That said, even if you do fail, you will probably learn some useful things along the way.  However, the time might be better spent learning to understand an existing distribution (such as raspbian) and how to use it to create your home automation system.</sup></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is best treated as an estimate. </p>

<p>The results show that the Raspberry Pi actually performed damn well considering. It was only slightly less responsive than my primary webserver.</p>

<p>It should be fine handling a reasonably large number of requests.</p>

"How does memory-mapped I/O addressing work?","17111","","<p>How does memory-mapped I/O addressing work?</p>

<p>I'm trying to understand a sample supplied <em><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=8496&amp;p=101319"">I2S: Anyone got it running?</a></em>.</p>

<p>Configuring Clocks:</p>

<pre><code>#define BCM2708_PERI_BASE        0x20000000
#define CLOCK_BASE               (BCM2708_PERI_BASE + 0x101000) /* Clocks */
</code></pre>

<p>It first maps the code like so...</p>

<pre><code>clk_map = (unsigned char *)mmap(
      (caddr_t)clk_mem,
      MAP_BLOCK_SIZE,
      PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
      MAP_SHARED|MAP_FIXED,
      mem_fd,
      CLOCK_BASE
   );
</code></pre>

<p>Then it does something...</p>

<pre><code> // Always use volatile pointer!
   clk = (volatile unsigned *)clk_map;
</code></pre>

<p>And when it's referenced there's these odd addtions of 0x26 &amp; 0x27, what's that about?</p>

<pre><code> printf(""Disabling I2S clock\n"");
 *(clk+0x26) = 0x5A000000;
 *(clk+0x27) = 0x5A000000;

 usleep(10);

 printf(""Confiure I2S clock\n"");
 *(clk+0x26) = 0x5A000001;
 *(clk+0x27) = 0x5A000000 | 3&lt;&lt;12 | 1&lt;&lt;9; // divider: 3.125==0b11.001

 usleep(10);
 printf(""Enabling I2S clock\n"");
 *(clk+0x26) = 0x5A000011;
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the datasheet, I can see where they've got some of these values, like the base address, but I'm struggling to understand the others. Where is that <code>CLOCK_BASE</code> determined and what's going on?</p>
","<p>On a computer you write to a specified 'memory address'. This address is recognised by the system as a hardware address, and the appropriate hardware receives or sends the appropriate value.</p>

<p>Most hardware systems have many different registers that can be set or read. Some might have a few, some might have many. These registers will be grouped into a continuous range. A base pointer points to the first in the range, and you write to, for example, the second port with base_pointer+1. You don't have to, you could write direct to a pointer, but using an offset makes things easier to work with.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi recognises a massive range of hardware registers at the address 0x20000000.
A range of registers that control clock systems are accessed from BCM2708_PERI_BASE + 0x101000. The registers that control the I2S clock are the 38th and 39th register in that block, written to using 
BCM2708_PERI_BASE + 0x101000 + 0x26 and 0x27</p>

<p>You can't just change the clock values though, you have to disable the clock, change the values and restart it.</p>

<p>If this answer is too basic, my apologies. In which case your question is really hardcore, good luck. You might find <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=8476&amp;p=101994"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this link</a> helpful</p>

<p><strong>Update: Why use mmap and not write directly to memory?</strong></p>

<p>When a program is running the memory addresses it thinks it has aren't real addresses, they are mapped to real addresses by the memory manager. This stops one program from being able to affect another. Two processes can read and write to their own address 1234 perfectly happily, and the memory manager will keep the two locations completely separate.</p>

<p>Hardware ports, however, are at absolute physical addresses. But you cant write to them directly because the memory manager will take your address and map it to your personal memory area.</p>

<p>On Linux /dev/mem is a '<a href=""http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl4_mem.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">character device file that is an image of the main memory of the computer</a>'</p>

<p>If you open this like a file then you can read and write to it like a file. In the supplied sample mem_fd is a file handle that resulted from opening /dev/mem</p>

<p>Another system that can make life much easier is the ability to map a file to memory and write to it like memory. So if you have a file in which  you want to read or write different specific bits then instead of moving the file pointer backwards and forwards, you can map it to a location in memory, and then write to it directly as if it was memory.</p>

<p>So in this sample the code is creating a handle to physical memory, as though it were a file on disk, and then asking the system to treat it as though it was memory. A bit convoluted, but necessary in order to get round the virtual memory manager and write to an actual physical address. The value 0x20000000, it seems, is a bit of a red herring. The code is proposing this address as a hint, the system does not have to map /dev/mem here, though it probably does. Normally the value null would be passed, and the system would map the file handle to whatever address it thought best.</p>

<p>Now the physical memory is mapped to the processes virtual memory, and reads and writes go where you expect.</p>

"Remove boot messages (all text) in Jessie","17072","","<p>I have a custom python app that I wanted to have started automatically on the RPi with the official touch screen. </p>

<p>This used to work fine without a sleuth of boot messages appearing until the latest update in Jessie with the PIXEL desktop. My 'asplashscreen' script that I used to use now is littered with boot messages again. </p>

<p>I dumped 'asplashscreen' and since Plymouth has finally been patched to work (after PIXEL release) I now have Plymouth showing a pretty boot screen, but the old methods of silencing the boot messages don't seem to work anymore. </p>

<p><strong>How can I remove ALL boot messages (including auto-login and kernel) messages?</strong></p>
","<p><em>Please note that removing the output of message can also hinder your ability to troubleshoot your system after. You may want to wait until you are in the finishing stages before applying these fixes.</em></p>

<p>As of December 2016, a lot of the old methods seemed to have stopped working. 
I created this question/answer post because it took me many hours to aggregate all the solutions. What I did to remove <em>ALL</em> the boot up text (even login messages):</p>

<p><strong>1.) Change /boot/cmdline.txt</strong></p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Change the console from tty1 to </p>

<pre><code>console=tty3 
</code></pre>

<p>Add this to the end of the line. 'loglevel=0' removes most of the messages from the boot. You can also use 'loglevel=3', but some boot messages may re-appear.</p>

<pre><code>quiet splash loglevel=0 logo.nologo vt.global_cursor_default=0
</code></pre>

<p>If you are going to use Plymouth add this:</p>

<pre><code>plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2.) Tell dmesg to be quiet</strong></p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local
</code></pre>

<p>Add this before 'exit 0':</p>

<pre><code>#Suppress Kernel Messages
dmesg --console-off
</code></pre>

<p>This should take care of most boot messages this far. #2 also took care of the 'watchdog watchdog0: watchdog did not stop!' message on shutdown for me.</p>

<p><strong>3.) Change the auto login in systemd (Hides the login message when auto-login happens)</strong></p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/autologin\@.service
</code></pre>

<p>Change your auto login ExecStart from:</p>

<pre><code>ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin pi --noclear %I $TERM
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --skip-login --noclear --noissue --login-options ""-f pi"" %I $TERM
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Make sure to change 'pi' to the username you use!</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>4.) Change /etc/pam.d/login (removes the Kernel version from showing when you auto-login)</strong></p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/pam.d/login
</code></pre>

<p>Change the line</p>

<pre><code>session    optional   pam_exec.so type=open_session stdout /bin/uname -snrvm
</code></pre>

<p>To be </p>

<pre><code>session    optional   pam_exec.so type=open_session stdout
</code></pre>

<p><strong>5.) Add .hushlogin</strong> </p>

<pre><code>touch ~/.hushlogin
</code></pre>

<p><strong>or Remove Message of the Day -MOTD (alternative to 5)</strong></p>

<pre><code>sudo update-rc.d motd remove
</code></pre>

<p>Now my boot just shows the Plymouth boot screen, and goes into my python GUI.</p>

"Reliably Reading from the Serial Port in Python","17063","","<p>I am trying to communicate between a pair of RPi's both with Ciseco XRF Radios on Slice of Pi's.</p>

<p>My end goal is for RPi1 to send a specific phrase to RPi2 which will pick it up, perform some actions(collecting data from some sensors) and send a response; I figured serialport.read/write is the best way to do this.</p>

<p>I'm working on the very basic stage of this which is simply RPi2 listening to the serial port and printing whatever it recieves. My code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>import serial

while True:
serialport = serial.Serial(""/dev/ttyAMA0"", 9600, timeout=0.5)
command = serialport.read()
print str(command)
</code></pre>

<p>I can run this fine and it picks things up that I type/paste into RPi1 but not reliably; for example if I paste 'hello world' into the terminal on RPi1 I get:</p>

<pre><code>l
l
o
</code></pre>

<p>appearing at RPi2. If I add a time delay (time.sleep(3) for example) I get nothing. My guess is that it is only picking up data if it is sent at the same time as it is reading.</p>

<p>Is there some way to reliably read everything that comes out of the serial port? 
(Maybe RPi2 store the input somewhere and read everything since its last read or something.)</p>
","<p>You should not re-create the object Serial at each iteration of the loop. I suppose that the line <code>serialport = serial.Serial(""/dev/ttyAMA0"", 9600, timeout=0.5)</code> closes and re-opens the serial port, flushing all the buffers.</p>

<p>Try this : </p>

<pre><code>import serial

serialport = serial.Serial(""/dev/ttyAMA0"", 9600, timeout=0.5)

while True:    
    command = serialport.read()
    print str(command)

"How can I use my Raspberry Pi for motion detection and SMS?","16899","","<p>I'm just starting out. How could I use my Raspberry Pi to do the following: when any movement is detected at my front door, send me a text message (SMS)?</p>
","<p>My answer is in two parts, one for motion detection and another for SMS. A project like this has two components: hardware and software. Detecting motion is the hardware part and everything else is software.</p>

<h1>Motion</h1>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>To detect movement, get a motion sensor. I use the Parallax PIR Motion Sensor: <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B007Z7NUJY"">Amazon affiliate link here.</a> The sensor has 3 pins: GND, VCC and OUT. Connect the pins to your RPi or connect them to a breadboard and connect the pins from the RPi to the same breadboard. Connect GND to a GND pin (6), VCC to a 3.3v pin (1) and OUT to GPIO0 (11).</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>I recommend you use the WiringPi library. Follow these instructions to download and install the library on your Pi: <a href=""http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/"">Wiring Pi Library Download and Install</a>. The pin on the motion sensor reads High if motion is detected and Low if it's not. </p>

<p>The motion detector resets itself after about 10 seconds when continuous motion ends. So the pin could fire many times in response to a single motion. To avoid getting SMS messages every few seconds, you probably want to include logic in your program to wait a certain amount of time before sending another SMS.</p>

<h2>SMS</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways you can do this. One way is to subscribe to a paid service that provides a library you can call with the pertinent information to send the SMS. <a href=""https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries"">Twilio API Libraries</a> is a good example of this.</p>

<p>If you don't want to spend any money and you have a Google Voice number connected to your cellphone, you can use the Google Voice C++ API that Steven Hickson developed for the RPi  (<a href=""http://stevenhickson.blogspot.com/2013/05/using-google-voice-c-api.html"">Google Voice C++ API</a>). The end result might look something like this (I wrote it but did not load and test it on the RPi):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;wiringPi.h&gt;

#include &lt;string.h&gt;

#define SUCCESS 0
#define LOGIN_ERROR 1
#define SMS_ERROR 2

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    time_t lastSent, now;
    int result;

    // track the time we sent the last SMS
    lastSent = time(NULL) - 60*(MINUTES_TO_WAIT + 1)

    // set up motion pin
    wiringPiSetup();
    pinMode(MOTION_PIN, INPUT);

    while (true) {
        if (digitalRead(MOTION_PIN)==HIGH) { // motion detected
            // get the current time
            time(&amp;now);

            // if we've waited long enough, send a message
            if (difftime(now, lastSent)/60) &gt; MINUTES_TO_WAIT) {
                if (result = sendSMS()) {
                    print(""Message sent!\n"");

                } else {

                }
            }
        }
    }

}

    // Uses the Google Voice C++ API by Steven Hickson

    if (gv.Login(username, password)) {

I assume that there is already a compiler installed but I don't know what it is (gcc maybe?). Any help is appreciated!</p>
","<p>Depends on how much assembler you want to write. If you want to write only small snippets embedded in C code, than <code>gcc</code> is indeed what you are looking for. Examples of how to use the <code>asm</code> directive in C see inline asm reference at: <a href=""http://www.ethernut.de/en/documents/arm-inline-asm.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ARM GCC Inline Assembler Cookbook</a></p>

<p>If on the other hand you want to write more than just small snippets than you'll be better of using a full assembler. This will be available as either <code>as</code>, <code>gas</code> or both (aliased).</p>

<p>And finally you'll need to learn a bit about the ARM instruction set. There is a handy reference at: <a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0301h/DDI0301H_arm1176jzfs_r0p7_trm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ARM1176JZF-S Technical Reference Manual</a>.</p>

"How do I configure the Raspberry Pi to boot with an NFS root?","16786","","<p>How can I make my Raspberry Pi use an NFS server for the root filesystem, instead of the SD card?</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to set up my Raspberry Pi to have its root file system on a remote machine via NFS for performance/backup/development purposes. How can I do this?</p>
","<h1>The short version</h1>

<ol>
<li>You need to prepare a root and export it from the NFS machine</li>
<li>You need to configure the early stage booting to use that</li>
</ol>

<p>You'll still need a SD card for the early stage booting, but after that nothing except /boot will need the SD card.</p>

<h1>Details</h1>

<p>I've only done this on a Linux machine. In theory it's possible on any machine that can export NFS filesystems though.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The easiest way to prepare a root filesystem is to copy the one provided by the existing images. I used the <a href=""http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/images/debian/6/debian6-19-04-2012/debian6-19-04-2012.zip"">official Debian 6 image</a> as my starting point:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the image, extract the .zip file. You should now have debian6-19-04-2012.img somewhere</li>
<li><p>Mount the root partition from that image using a loopback device. You'll need the offset into the image for the start of the root partition, in this instance it's the second partition in the image:</p>

<pre>
fdisk -l debian6-19-04-2012.img

Disk debian6-19-04-2012.img: 1949 MB, 1949999616 bytes
4 heads, 32 sectors/track, 29754 cylinders, total 3808593 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x000ee283


Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
debian6-19-04-2012.img1            2048      155647       76800    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
debian6-19-04-2012.img2          157696     3414015     1628160   83  Linux
debian6-19-04-2012.img3         3416064     3807231      195584   82  Linux swap / Solaris
root@rapunzel:/tmp/debian6-19-04-2012# 
</pre>

<p>The second partition starts at block (or sector) 157696 so the offset is (512*157696) = 80740352:</p>

<pre>
root@rapunzel:/tmp/debian6-19-04-2012# mkdir /mnt/pi-root-loop
root@rapunzel:/tmp/debian6-19-04-2012# mount -o loop,offset=80740352 /tmp/debian6-19-04-2012/debian6-19-04-2012.img /mnt/pi-root-loop
root@rapunzel:/tmp/debian6-19-04-2012# ls /mnt/pi-root-loop
bin   Desktop  etc   lib    mnt  proc  sbin  selinux  sys  usr
boot  dev      home  media  opt  root  sd    srv      tmp  var
root@rapunzel:/tmp/debian6-19-04-2012#
</pre></li>
<li><p>With the image mounted you probably want to copy this somewhere more permanent to avoid using the loopback device forever.  I made an LVM2 volume and mounted it at /mnt/rpi-root, so I did:</p>

<pre>
cp -rav /mnt/pi-root-loop/* /mnt/rpi-root/
</pre></li>
<li><p>We need to export the filesystem now, so we need to add a line like:</p>

<pre>
/mnt/rpi-root  192.168.1.2(rw,no_root_squash)
</pre>

<p>into /etc/exports on the NFS server, where 192.168.1.2 is the address of the Raspberry Pi. After adding that run <code>exportfs -rv</code> to re-read the list of exports. (See <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/5/exports"">exports(5)</a> for more advanced options including wildcards/subnets rather than individual hosts)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You could alternatively skip this step and build a root filesystem from scratch using something like <a href=""http://www.emdebian.org/emdebian/rootfs.html""><code>multistrap</code></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we need to build an SD card that does the early stage booting and boots using this NFS share. I did this by taking the first partition of the official image and copying that to an SD card, where the SD card is /dev/sdx:</p>

<pre>
dd if=/tmp/debian6-19-04-2012/debian6-19-04-2012.img of=/dev/sdx bs=512 count=155647
</pre>

<p>and then since this only copied the first partition editing the partition table with fdisk to delete the two partitions we didn't copy.</p>

<p>After that I mounted the partition from the SD card and edited the file cmdline.txt from it to read:</p>

<pre>
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=192.168.1.1:/mnt/rpi-root ip=dhcp rootfstype=nfs
</pre>

<p>where 192.168.1.1 is the address of the NFS server. If you don't want to use DHCP you can set the IP address alternative ways, see <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/marcelo/linux-2.4/Documentation/nfsroot.txt"">this document</a> for further details.</p>

<p>Once this is done you can unmount the SD card and boot your Rapsberry Pi with an NFS root. You can also manipulate the filesystem from the server side, or other NFS clients as you see fit (e.g. <a href=""http://wiki.debian.org/QemuUserEmulation"">QEMU+binfmt_misc</a>, LVM snapshots, backup systems etc.)</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Optional things</h1>

<ul>
<li>Setting RAMRUN and RAMLOCK to yes in /etc/default/rcS causes /var/run and /var/lock respectively to be mounted as tmpfs (i.e. ramdisk) - this is probably worthwhile, even if you only have the one device booting from the NFS filesystem.</li>
<li><p>If you're using ip=dhcp you'll probably need to comment out the line:</p>

<pre><code>#iface eth0 inet dhcp
</code></pre>

<p>in /etc/network/interfaces (/mnt/rpi-root/etc/network/interfaces) in order to avoid a situation where swapping between the early boot DHCP and the usual later one causes a message like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>nfs: server 192.168.1.1 not responding, still trying</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>If you want to boot lots of devices from the same root you'll need to take care of providing a ""local"" /tmp (probably tmpfs) and other subtleties to avoid problems with multiple machines trying to write to the same files.</p></li>
</ul>

</ol>

<p>I'm ready to dive into the ARM CPU's <a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0301h/DDI0301H_arm1176jzfs_r0p7_trm.pdf""><em>Technical Reference Manual</em></a> and <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf""><em>BCM2835 ARM Peripherals</em></a>, or any other doc.</p>

<p>Update: After posting, I found <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=6685"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=3042"">this</a>, stating the BCM2835's GPU is acting as a master to the ARM, and is heavily involved in the boot sequence.</p>
","<h1>The boot sequence of the Raspberry Pi is basically this:</h1>

<ol>
<li>Stage 1 boot is in the on-chip ROM. Loads Stage 2 in the L2 cache</li>
<li>Stage 2 is <code>bootcode.bin</code>. Enables SDRAM and loads Stage 3</li>
<li>Stage 3 is <code>loader.bin</code>. It knows about the <code>.elf</code> format and loads <code>start.elf</code></li>
<li><code>start.elf</code> loads <code>kernel.img</code>. It then also reads <code>config.txt</code>, <code>cmdline.txt</code> and <code>bcm2835.dtb</code>
If the dtb file exists, it is loaded at <code>0×100</code> &amp; kernel @ <code>0×8000</code>
If <code>disable_commandline_tags</code> is set it loads kernel @ <code>0×0</code>
Otherwise it loads kernel @ <code>0×8000</code> and put ATAGS at <code>0×100</code></li>
<li><code>kernel.img</code> is then run on the ARM.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Everything is run on the GPU until <code>kernel.img</code> is loaded on the ARM.</em></strong></p>

"Issue with MT7601U usb dongle wifi driver","16431","","<p>I bought a usb wifi dongle for my Raspberry Pi B+ and I can't install it on my RPi with 3.18.3+ kernel (OS: raspbian).</p>

<p>Here are the steps that I follow with no success:</p>

<p><code>lsusb</code> give me this output:</p>

<pre><code>Bus 001 Device 004: ID 148f:7601 Ralink Technology, Corp. MT7601U Wireless Adapter
</code></pre>

<p>I downloaded the lastest kernel release on github and extracted it: 
<a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/rpi-3.18.y.tar.gz"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/rpi-3.18.y.tar.gz</a> </p>

<p>made these instructions into rpi-linux-3.18 folder with no errors</p>

<pre><code>make mrproper
zcat /proc/config.gz &gt; .config
cp .config .config.org
sed -i 's/^CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE.*/CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE=""""/' .config
make modules_prepare
wget https://raw.github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/master/extra/Module.symvers
</code></pre>

<p>then I got the MTU7601U driver from MediaTek (file: DPO_MT7601U_LinuxSTA_3.0.0.4_20130913.tar.bz2 )</p>

<p>extracted it then proceed to <code>make &amp;&amp; make install</code>. 
In my first attempts I couldn't run correctly <code>make</code> because of an error with a struct in the <code>rt_linux.h</code>.</p>

<pre><code>error: incompatible types when assigning to type ‘int’ from type ‘kuid_t’
error: incompatible types when assigning to type ‘int’ from type ‘kgid_t’
</code></pre>

<p>so I made a patch in this file by replacing <code>int</code> by <code>kuid_t</code> and <code>kgid_t</code> respectively (maybe the driver doesn't work cause of it ?)</p>

<p>Then I <code>make &amp;&amp; make install</code> once again and (with lot of warnings) the driver compiled. </p>

<p>I installed by run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo insmod /lib/modules/3.18.3/kernel/drivers/net//wireless/mt7601Usta.ko
</code></pre>

<p>And reboot my rpi.. But when i plug my usb wifi dongle I get this error:</p>

"How to encode DVDs using the Raspberry Pi","16429","","<p>I've got a bunch of old DVDs I want to encode and put on my NAS as AVI. </p>

<p>I'd like to use my Raspberry Pi Model B for the encoding as I won't miss it if it's out of action for hours/ days/ weeks. In the past I would have used a (now defunct) old Linux box running Debian and Handbrake.</p>

<p>At the hardware end of things I have a USB external DVD reader/writer and a powered USB hub.</p>

<p>What is the best combination of operating system and software to achieve this on the Raspberry Pi? Are there any other considerations around hardware?</p>

<p>Or is the Pi CPU to low powered for practical video encoding?</p>
","<p>First of all its not efficient to rip a DVD on Raspberry Pi. I doubt Raspberry CPU/GPU can handle this without hardware acceleration. But you can give a shot for Handbrake.</p>

<p>To use handbrake on Raspberry Pi (or any armv6-hf) do this;</p>

<p>Add apt repository</p>

<pre><code>sudo echo ""deb http://honeybadger-apt.zapto.org wheezy main contrib non-free""  &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></pre>

<p>Add the honeybadger GPG key to your apt keyring</p>

<pre><code>wget -qO - ""http://honeybadger-apt.zapto.org/index.php?dir=&amp;file=matt.askthebadger%40gmail.com.gpg.key"" | sudo apt-key add -
</code></pre>

<p>Update repository index</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>Install handbrake-cli and libdvdread which will provide a library to remove the copy protection</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install handbrakecli libdvdread4
sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh
</code></pre>

<p>To create a DVD ISO file from a VIDEO_TS directory on your hard drive, run the following:</p>

<pre><code>mkisofs -dvd-video -udf -o dvd.iso /folder-with-VIDEO_TS-in-it/
</code></pre>

<p>then mount the DVD iso to /mnt </p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -o loop dvd.iso /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>This command will copy DVD vob files into a large file without copy protection.</p>

<pre><code>vobcopy -l -o outDir/
</code></pre>

<p>Then encode with handbrake-cli</p>

<pre><code>handbrake-cli -i outDir -o movie.mp4 -e x264 -q 20 -B 160 -t 1
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>-q quality<br>
  -B audio compress rate in Kbps<br>
  -t title id to convert<br>
  -e encode format  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it handbrake-cli can not handle without hardware acceleration you can try this transcoder. I haven't test it, but maybe it can work. just compile it then run;</p>

<pre><code>./omxtx [-b bitrate] input.foo output.m4v
</code></pre>

"Where is the PWM pin located exactly on the board?","16360","","<p>Can someone point me to exactly where the PWM pin is on the board and how I can hook this thing up visually as I'm totally lost as to what I would need to make this run. Also what is the snippet of code needed to make it pulse every 2 seconds.</p>
","<p>According to the <a href=""http://elinux.org/Rpi_Low-level_peripherals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">docs</a>, GPIO pin 18 supports PWM.</p>

<p>To control it from the shell without root permissions, you need to install the <a href=""https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiringPi</a> library. Take a look at the <a href=""https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/the-gpio-utility/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gpio docs</a> or the man page for more information:</p>

<pre><code>man gpio
</code></pre>

<p>In short: First set the mode of pin 18 to PWM:</p>

<pre><code>gpio -g mode 18 pwm
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can set the pin to a PWM value between 0 and 1023:</p>

<pre><code>gpio -g pwm 18 512
</code></pre>

<p>However, as Krzysztof already noted, you probably don't need PWM if you just want to send a short pulse. You could use a regular pin and simply turn it on and off every 2 seconds.</p>

<pre><code>gpio -g mode 17 out
gpio -g write 17 1
gpio -g write 17 0
</code></pre>

<p>You could also control it from a program, e.g. a Python script. You should find information about this in the <a href=""http://elinux.org/Rpi_Low-level_peripherals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">docs</a>.</p>

<p>All this is untested, but should work. If you have more problems, feel free to comment or look at the  or the manpage.</p>

"Raspberry Pi 3 and 64-bit kernel, differences between armv7 and armv8","16345","","<p>Is there any 64-bit kernel for Raspberry Pi 3? I looked around and from sources I check official page and following kernels are listed there:</p>

<ol>
<li>NOOBS - this is installer, no OS by itself, right?</li>
<li>Rapsbian - just one download, so I assume 32 bit compatible with all version of Pi</li>
<li>Ubuntu MATE - aarch32 (ARMv7) </li>
<li>Ubuntu Ubuntu Core - seems like 32bit only</li>
<li>OSMC - same downloads for ""Raspberry Pi 2 / 3"", so 32 bit</li>

I am using a 3.5 inch VGA TFT-LCD monitor, where the tiny font was hard to read, but I have managed to increase it (thanks to recantha, who answered my question ""how"") using ""setfont /usr/share/consolefonts/Lat15-TerminusBold20x10.psf.gz"". But now there is a letter missing on any line that reaches the right hand edge of the screen. I believe I should amend ""/boot/config.txt"" to correct this but I do not have that file, although all references suggest it should be there already.   </p>

<p>At first I could not find out how to turn the thing off, and I thought that unplugging it may have corrupted things, so I have just downloaded the .img and flashed the SD card again. Two things puzzle me: I still do not have a ""/boot/config.txt"" file; and the font came up big and bold, whereas I would have expected it to go back to the original size, so where was that information carried over the re-installation?</p>

<p>I'm still floundering, any help would be much appreciated.</p>
","<p>Did you run the setup properly at the first boot?Also you can run it again using the command</p>

<pre><code>$sudo raspi-config

<p>To manually add the file, just add a new file config.txt to the /boot folder.You can find the options from the <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPiconfig"" rel=""nofollow"">elinux</a> website.</p>

<p>I think changes are made to the firmware so it was still there after reflashing the sd card.</p>

","<p>If what @ott said doesn't work, Try restarting your router and resetting your Internet modem. Just because you're connected to the network doesn't mean you're connected to the Internet. You should also re-download noobs,  reinstall it,  then try to connect to the Internet. I had a similar issue as you did,  and a fresh installation of noobs fixed it for me. Using Ethernet connection, I would also try <code>sudo apt-get update</code> in the terminal.  When that completes,  use <code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code> to ensure you've got the current updates. This could help the wireless issue you're having. </p>

<p>Edit: I ran by this just today. Give this a try. It's straight from adafruit.com.</p>

"How can I change the RAM split?","16000","","<p>By default, the Pi is set to a 192MiB:64MiB RAM:VRAM split. As I will not be using the Pi for graphical purposes, I would like to change the split to allocate more normal RAM to ease swap usage.</p>
","<p>These are the RAM splits and what they should be used for.</p>

<ul>
<li>240/16 - This is best if you are going to be doing nothing graphical, for example if you were using the Pi as a server and have no GUI.</li>
<li>224/32 - This is probably best if you are using the pi with a basic graphical desktop environment, without 3D.</li>
<li>192/64 - The default, probably the best general purpose one.</li>
<li>128/128 - Very high VRAM, Only really good if you are doing a very graphically intensive task.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>There are several methods by which the RAM split can be managed:</p>

<h2>Manually</h2>

<p>You can change the RAM split using this method: </p>

<pre><code>sudo cp /boot/arm[ram-split]_start.elf /boot/start.elf
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>[ram-split]</code> is the amount of RAM to allocate to the CPU. After a reboot the new value will be applied.</p>

<h2>rpi-update</h2>

<p>Hexxeh's <a href=""https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rpi-update</a> also supports changing the RAM split, you would run <code>rpi-update [ram-split]</code> where <code>[ram-split]</code> is the amount of RAM you want allocated to the CPU. After a reboot the split will be applied.</p>

<h2>Ram Selector Script</h2>

<p>The best way is probably to use <a href=""http://sirlagz.net/?p=557"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this select4.sh script</a>, then selecting the appropriate RAM split. After you reboot the new split will be applied.</p>

"Write an OS for Raspberry Pi in C","15894","","<p>I already found the <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/"">Baking Pi tutorials</a>, but they only use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language"">assembly language</a>. I followed the first lessons, but I am already wondering how to use C instead. I mean, there is a reason they invented higher-level languages. I tried just compiling the C code to an object (<code>.o</code>) file, compiling</p>

<pre><code>.section .init
.globl _start
_start:

bl main

loop$:
b loop$
</code></pre>

<p>to another object file and linking them together and so obtaining <code>kernel.img</code>. I then replaced the already present kernel with my own, but it doesn't execute the C code. The C code I wrote should just turn on the OK LED and then return (then comes <code>loop$: b loop$</code>). But the OK LED flashes randomly a few times and then just stays off. Here's my C code:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
    volatile unsigned *gpioAddr = (volatile unsigned *)0x20200000;
    *(gpioAddr + 4) = 1 &lt;&lt; 18;
    *(gpioAddr + 40) = 1 &lt;&lt; 16;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>How do I use C for operating system development on a Raspberry Pi?</p>

<p>I doubt it is an error in the code (although I'm just a hobbyist). I'm aware setting up C may be complicated, but I'm not the first one doing this. AFAIK, all the currently dominant OSes are mainly written in C, so there has to be an article explaining the process. I would be very happy with a list of steps too, so I can google for those steps and perhaps ask a question a little less broad.</p>

<p>Note: the ARM assembly equivalent of the above C code works just fine. It turns on the LED (after a bit of blinking). I think (hope) that indicates my Raspberry Pi is fine.</p>
","<p>I wrote a very simple kernel years ago, and ran it on a 386.  I haven't done bare metal programming in years, but in broad terms you need to write some assembler code that will:</p>

<ul>
<li>disable interrupts during the boot process </li>
<li>if the Pi has a memory controller, you'll need to set that up</li>
<li>set up a timer tick </li>
<li>configure the interrupt controller</li>
<li>set up a stack so that you can execute C code</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting up the stack is easy - find some memory that's not being used, and load that address into which ever register is used as the stack pointer.</p>

<p>In your C code you need to init OS data structures like a memory pools and thread tables.  You won't be able to use C library functions - you'll need to write that stuff yourself.</p>

<p>If you want to write a simple multitasking os, you'll need to write some assembler routines to save CPU registers on the stack, and load a different set of register values from another thread's stack.  And you'll need to write an API to create different threads.</p>

"How to change raspberry pi 2 overclock to default on Raspbian","15802","","<p>I've been wondering how I could reset my raspberry pi 2 to its stock clock after I used the <code>raspi-config</code> utils. The only options I had were primarily for the first Raspberry. There's no ""default"" value for the Pi2.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Chose overclock preset                                                       

 None    700MHz ARM, 250MHz core, 400MHz SDRAM, 0 overvolt                     
 Modest  800MHz ARM, 250MHz core, 400MHz SDRAM, 0 overvolt                     
 Medium  900MHz ARM, 250MHz core, 450MHz SDRAM, 2 overvolt                     
 High    950MHz ARM, 250MHz core, 450MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolt                     
 Turbo  1000MHz ARM, 500MHz core, 600MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolt                   
 Pi2    1000MHz ARM, 500MHz core, 500MHz SDRAM, 2 overvolt  
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it's possible to overclock the default 900Mhz from the raspberry pi 2, but there's no solution for going back to stock configuration using the <code>raspi-config</code> tool. So how on Earth are we supposed to rollback after an overclock?</p>
","<p>After some digging, I found a rather simple solution. You'll have to edit your <code>config.txt</code> file. Located on the FAT partition of your raspberry pi SD card.
It's perfectly possible to do it using the pi itself, or you could just plug the microSD card on your computer and use your favorite editor for this.</p>

<p>Ok, now to the configurations...</p>

<p>I'm assuming you're using the raspibian with the command line, but again, you can do this with any text editor.</p>

<p>First, obviously, open the <code>config.txt</code> file. It's located on the path <code>/boot/config.txt</code>.</p>

<p>E.G.: <code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt</code></p>

<p>With your file open, try to find those lines:</p>

<pre><code>arm_freq=1000
core_freq=500
sdram_freq=500
over_voltage=2
</code></pre>

<p>Change those with these ones:</p>

<pre><code>arm_freq=900 
core_freq=250 
sdram_freq=450
</code></pre>

<p>And this line on the file:</p>

<pre><code>over_voltage=2
</code></pre>

<p>Just comment it to be like this, or erase it:</p>

<pre><code>#over_voltage=2
</code></pre>

<p>For more information about overclocking your raspberry pi (Version 1 or 2, model A or B) refer to <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPiconfig#Overclocking"">this link</a>. And if you want to learn a little more about the configuration file itself, use the <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt.md"">official docs</a>.</p>

"How can my Raspberry PI start my TV?","15799","","<p>My Raspberry Pi is running RaspBMC and is hooked up to my TV via a HDMI cable. I never turn off the Pi itself, but I tend to turn the TV off when I'm not using it. However, once the Pi senses any input (key-down etc), it turns my TV on. </p>

<p>How is this possible?</p>
","<p>I would guess that when you say you <em>turn the TV off</em> you are using the remote control to do so, not the switch at the wall.</p>

<p>Most TV's don't actually <em>turn off</em> with the <em>off button</em>, they just go into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standby_power"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">standby</a> mode. This allows them to monitor your remote control so that they can sense when you command the TV to turn back on again via the remote.</p>

<p>In the same way, many TV's will monitor input signals (HDMI, Scart etc.) and turn themselves on when a new signal is received. I suspect that what is happening is that when the Raspberry Pi is coming out of sleep, it starts sending a video signal to the TV again, bringing it out of sleep too.</p>

<p>Alternatively, as <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/1744/141"">Krzysztof suggests</a>, Raspbmc may be commanding the TV to turn on via the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#CEC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CEC</a> protocol channel, so you may be able to disable it.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=2485&amp;start=50"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HDMI CEC and XBMC</a> thread on the Raspberry Pi forums, the <a href=""http://libcec.pulse-eight.com/faq"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libCEC FAQ</a> explains how to do this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where can I find the CEC adapter's settings in XBMC?</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Go to System -> Input -> Peripherals -> Pulse-Eight CEC Adapter.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>What's the meaning of the CEC adapter's settings in XBMC?</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Enabled: use the CEC adapter within XBMC. Default: Enabled.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course while the upside of <em>off</em> meaning <em>standby</em> is convenience, downside is that the TV consumes power even when it is <em>off</em>.</p>

"Why are some GPIO pins HIGH when the Raspberry Pi boots up?","15773","","<p>I have an easy circuit wired up, with an LED connected to pin 18 on the BOARD reference. I run a simple program to put pin 18 to HIGH, which turns the LED on, and then a couple of seconds later, I set pin 18 to LOW, and finally I end my program with GPIO.cleanup().</p>

<p>At this point the LED is off, which means that pin 18 is off (LOW). Now I reboot or restart my Raspberry Pi, and when it boots back up, the LED on pin 18 turns on again, even though the pin was off before I rebooted the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Why may this be happening? How can I configure a specific pin, like pin 18 to be off when the Raspberry Pi boots up? And I don't want any GPIO pins to be on HIGH when the Raspberry Pi boots up.</p>

<p>I am concerned about this problem, because let's say that pin 18 is connected to a DC motor on a robot, and when the Raspberry Pi boots up, the motor will turn on, and this is not something that I want because that will interferes with the whole structure of the robot, and some motors might start and others won't, depending on the pins they are connected to. I want to manually turn on all the motors in a synchronized manner.</p>

<p>One other thing is that not all the pins have this problem. Some stay off when the Raspberry Pi boots, but others don't.</p>
","<p>At powerup the GPIOs are pulled either high or low through the internal resistors. Whether the pull is high or low for a particular GPIO is detailed on page 102 of <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2835/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf"">BCM2835 ARM Peripherals</a>.</p>

<p>As the Linux kernel is started and if device tree is enabled (likely) then it will reconfigure the GPIOs according to the device tree settings.  Modules loaded from <code>/etc/modules</code> could also update the GPIO state.</p>

<p>Any other software you have running at start up could potentially reconfigure the GPIOs subsequent to the device tree settings and module loads.</p>

<p>It is safest to find a hardware solution if you have hardware which could be incorrectly triggered at system startup.</p>

"Maximum, demonstrated SD card durability","15648","","<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I was able to solve this problem years ago, but for anyone reading this in the future, the durability problems turned out to be related to flaky power supplies.</p>

<p>--- Original question ---</p>

<p>I'm attempting to use the Raspberry Pi as an embedded/industrial computer. Temperatures are within completely sane ranges, and the primary reliability issues I'm running into are seem to be around SD card deaths after a few months.</p>

<p>Are there any published stats of SD cards in use in industrial/embedded solutions and their MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure)? I've seen a few basic stats claiming 1,000,000 write cycles per sector with wear leveling built into the card, and that's all well and good, but I'm looking for published, real-world test results, not the sales spec sheets, showing real-world performance and failure numbers.</p>

<p>Ideally I need something that I can reliability write to continuously for about 2 years before failure for an embedded linux install that occupies about 1.8 Gb of space on the card. I'm also aware that the larger your free space, the more you can spread out the wear leveling, so larger cards of the same durability effectively give you longer life.</p>

<p>Anyone try to use Raspberry Pis in an industrial situation successfully?</p>

It is about power failures but the discussion touches on the expected life of NAND chips and similar. No manufactures were revealed but the results are interesting.</p>

<p>The best approach is to try and increase the life of card in lieu of trying to figure out how long it should last. You should act in best interest to double its life time that will guarantee a full 2 year span of normal operation.</p>

<p>You can start by making the root file system read only. This also involves turning off logging or moving it to <code>/tmp</code>. You will also opt out of regular updates or manually mounting the file system with write permission to update if needed.</p>

<p>Create an ""infrequent"" data partition for infrequently accessed files, like web server files or FTP access.</p>

<p>Two or more partition for backups.</p>

<p>Set your <code>/tmp</code> to use RAM and store frequently written files there.  Check in <code>/etc/fstab</code> to adjust settings.</p>

<p>Have a separate process do a backup of your <code>/tmp</code> files every <code>n</code> minutes or hours to the separate smaller data partitions. You could even copy the same file to two identically sized partition for redundancy if you are really paranoid.</p>

<p>If the SD card dies of fatigue due to extreme temperatures or voltage spikes then not  everything is lost. Good data recovery companies can read the chips and rebuild the data for you if it is very important. Usually only the controllers fry while the memory chips still contain all the data.</p>

  <p>How can I properly launch RPi GUI via Cygwin ssh terminal?</p>

<p>First make sure you installed X11 packages from your Cygwin installer. After that launch a Cygwin terminal.</p>

<pre><code>$ cygstart xwin
$ DISPLAY=:0.0
$ export DISPLAY
</code></pre>

<p>First line will launch a black screen, which you will project your RPi's desktop to. Second line will make sure the terminal is aware of this remote display (0.0 is the device which you can see in the window of your display as in Cygwin/X:<strong>0.0</strong>). Next, connect to your RPi.</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh -Y pi@address

"Configuring the Pi to use a D-Link DWA-131 USB Wifi adapter","15313","","<p>I bought a D-Link DWA-131 USB Wifi adapter as it was supposed to work straight out of the box. The device shows up OK in the USB list (lsusb). I've added the wlanX sections to the /etc/network/interfaces file. But there seems to be a problem connecting to my network, specifically, trouble with the mac address.</p>

<p>The reported mac address for the DWA-131 dongle changes depending on how it's plugged in.</p>

<p>If it's plugged directly into the pi's USB socket, the ifconfig shows the correct mac address, the light never flashes and the device can't connect to the router, even when close and with a clear line of sight.</p>

<p>If it's plugged into the powered hub, ifconfig shows a mac address of ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, the light flashes and the device can see the router, the router can also see the device, the router sees the device's mac address as ff:...:ff. The SSID is visible. The dhcp requests never make it to the dhcp server (an Ubuntu box), the server never responds (obviously) and the router only shows packets coming from the dongle and never to it.</p>

<p>The mac address looks wrong to me when using the hub. Does anyone know how to get this thing to use the correct mac address? I've tried putting a ""hwaddress ether "" into my interfaces file but that was just ignored.</p>

","<p>In some cases, the signal integrity of SD cards can be marginal - the signals have to come off the SoC, down the PCB traces, through the socket, and into the SD card.  SD cards, especially fast cards, can be clocked at up to 100MHz.  MicroSD adaptors are often designed to be as cheap as possible, and may make the signal integrity worse.  For example, I have a £1 USB card reader that will read MicroSD in its own dedicated MicroSD slot, but not in an adaptor in the normal SD slot (which reads full SD cards just fine).  If you open up an adaptor, you find it's just a series of metal pins in plastic - no shielding or any other signal protection.</p>

<p>Now the Pi isn't a £1 card reader, but the same issues may apply - the more connectors you have, the higher chance you have of pushing it over the edge in high speed modes.  If you look at dmesg and see SD command errors, that's where you'll see problems if they occur.  It's more likely if you're thrashing the card (eg using as swap) rather than people who just use them for moving photos about.</p>

"Reading pin state whether it's input or output using Python's RPi.GPIO","14826","","<p>Is it possible to read the pin state (1 or 0) whether it's set as output or input without setting this with <code>RPi.GPIO.setup</code> (pin, GPIO.IN/GPIO.OUT)? I mean, I can do this via this command: </p>

<pre><code>gpio read 2
</code></pre>

<p>But when I try to do this in a Python script like this:</p>

<pre><code>GPIO.input(pin)
</code></pre>

<p>It's says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RuntimeError: you must setup() the GPIO channel first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems that I must specify pin input or output, but I don't want to do this!</p>
","<p>If you are using an operating system that has Sysfs support for GPIO (e.g. Raspbian), then you can use that to read the pin state from within Python.  Note that this method uses BCM pin numbering.</p>

<p>To check the state of pin GPIO24, first you need to export it to userspace. As root, do the shell command</p>

<pre><code>echo 24 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export
</code></pre>

<p>That creates a sysfs directory for the pin at <code>/sys/class/gpio/gpio24/</code>, containing various files you can read and write to to control the pin.  You can access them via a Python script like this:</p>

<pre><code>try:
  with open(""/sys/class/gpio/gpio24/value"") as pin:
    status = pin.read(1)
except:
  print ""Remember to export the pin first!""
  status = ""Unknown""

print status
</code></pre>

<p>This will work whether or not you have set up the pin using RPi.GPIO.  However, if you do then use RPi.GPIO or another library to access the pin, you need to be aware that setting up a pin as an input or output may change its state.  You will need to experiment!</p>

<p>eLinux.org has lots of useful information about accessing <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals"" rel=""nofollow"">RPi Low-level peripherals</a> and GPIO by different methods.

<p>Therefore, what are the implications to changing the username of ""pi"" on Raspbian and Raspbmc?</p>

<p>Do I need to do anything other than just editing /etc/password changing ""pi"" to some new string?</p>

<p>Researching on how to force <code>sudo</code> to require a password I discovered that <code>/etc/sudoers</code> on my Raspbmc contains an entry for ""pi"", so therefore I at least need to update that file accordingly.</p>
","<p>Changing the user login name should work. It's just a piece of text for people to use. UID is the thing that actually identifies a user to the system. Some config files can indeed be using the name and of course the user has a home dir etc.</p>

<p>You shouldn't edit passwd file by hand, but by tools like vipw or <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/8/usermod"">usermod</a>. Remember that there's probably <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_%28file%29"">a shadow system</a> as well, so you need to make sure they're both updated properly.</p>

<p>I wouldn't try to rename a user but create a new one and either disable or remove the default account. Removing it risks a new user with the same uid (getting same file access etc) or login name (e.g. sudo rights) getting added later.</p>

"How can I automatically update the hwclock with NTP when I have internet connection","14785","","<p>I'm using an RPi with Raspbian which runs the NTP-daemon by default. I have connected an rtc-ds1307 external i2c hardware clock. I was following the instructions given here to set it up:</p>

<p><a href=""http://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/set-rtc-time"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/set-rtc-time</a></p>

<p>After removing the default fake-hwclock from the system, basically everything worked fine. When I boot the RPi without network connection, the time from the external hwclock is copied to the system clock. When there is Internet connection the NTP-daemon updates the system time afterwards. When I regularly shut down the RPi, the Internet-time is copied to the external hwclock. But in case of a power out, the old time remains on it. </p>

<p>Is there a simple way to always check the difference between the hw-clock and the time-server. I mean, if the time-server can be accessed and there is a certain difference between hw-clock and the time-server, then the hw-clock should be updated. If there is no Internet connection, the system anyway relies on the hw-clock after booting.</p>

"building kernel image (.img) including ramdisk","14651","","<p>I have built my Linux kernel (3.0.1) for my Raspberry Pi with these following steps:</p>

<pre><code>1. Downloading kernel source
2. tar xvf source.tar.bz2
3. downloading arm cross compilation tool.
4. tar xvf arm-2010q1-202-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
5. setting up path for cross tool export PATH=$PATH:/home/shan/&lt;cross tool folder&gt;/bin/
6. after entering linux source dir make ARCH=arm versatile_defconfig (is this reliable   with raspberry pi)
7. make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
8. zImage is generated in /arch/arm/boot
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, how can I build kernel.img? I think it contains zImage + ramdisk but how can I build this? </p>

<p>Can anyone guide me to making ramdisk and pack these two into kernel.img file? I want to boot this kernel on my Raspberry Pi.</p>
","<h2>kernel.img file</h2>

<p>When using Linux kernel, <code>kernel.img</code> file is just a renamed <code>linux/arch/arm/boot/Image</code>. It should also be possible (or at least it was possible last time I checked) to use compressed version of this file - <code>zImage</code>. 
It can contain integrated <code>initramfs</code> (ramdisk) but it is not required. For example, stock <code>kernel.img</code> file does not contain <code>initramfs</code> while <code>kernel_emergency.img</code> does.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Official kernel compilation guide on <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Kernel_Compilation"" rel=""nofollow"">eLinux wiki</a> suggest that you should use <code>imagetool-uncompressed.py</code> tool to prepare <code>kernel.img</code> file. It was necessary in early days of RaspberyPi but nowadays bootloader can handle regular <code>Image</code> and <code>zImage</code> files.</p>

<h2>Kernel sources issue</h2>

<p>What is very important is that when building kernel for RaspberryPi, you can't just use any version of it. Only special version that is ported to RaspberryPi will work. Unfortunately, current upstream version (found on <code>kernel.org</code> site) is not compatible with RaspberryPi. Also, <code>versatil_config</code> is not good for RaspberryPi, you should use <code>bcmrpi_defconfig</code> instead (found on RaspberryPi compatible kernel sources) or <code>bcmrpi_emergency_defconfig</code> if your plan on using buildin <code>initramfs</code>.</p>

<h2>Kernel building instructions</h2>

<p>The best place to grab kernel sources for RaspberryPi is on <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux"" rel=""nofollow"">foundation github</a>. You can also find some useful explaination on how to get it and how to compile it on <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Kernel_Compilation"" rel=""nofollow"">official RasbperryPi wiki</a>. Here's my little simplified version of the steps involved (NOTE: I assume you want to crosscompile the kernel. It is much faster and should create the same results but building kernel natively on RaspberryPi is also possible):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download official toolchain on create your own. Eigher way, I asssume it's installed in <code>/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-*</code>. If you have it in other place, you should change <code>CROSS_COMPILE</code> option in all your <code>make</code> commands.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux</a> site where you can find official RapsberryPi kernel sources. You can download the code in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>As a compressed file</strong> (to use this option you don't have to install <code>git</code> utility and you can do this even on RapsberryPi itself): Click on <code>ZIP</code> icon, a little below <code>Code</code> tab at the top of site. This should let you download lates source files as <code>zip</code> file. You could use git to do this instead but that (as described on the wiki) will need a lot more space and time. Then decompress the file to get source tree.</li>
<li><p><strong>Using <code>git</code> utility</strong> (this didn't work for me on RaspberryPi as there is small amount of RAM probably but should work OK on desktop systems (note <code>--depth 1</code> argument which prevents git from downloading whole history of the development (which is huge):</p>

<pre><code>git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Use default config supplied by foundation:</p>

<pre><code>cp arch/arm/configs/bcmrpi_defconfig .config
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Run <code>make oldconfig</code> and answer some questions (it should be ok to hit enter in each question leaving default answer):</p>

<pre><code>make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi- oldconfig
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Compile the kernel:</p>

<pre><code>make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Copy kernel modules to <code>/tmp/modules</code>:</p>

<pre><code>make ARCH=arm modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/tmp/modules
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Use <code>Image</code> file as <code>kernel.img</code></p></li>
<li><p>Upload all the modules to from <code>/tmp/modules/lib/modules/</code> in your computer to <code>/lib/modules/</code> directory on your RaspberryPi rootfs.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Adding initramfs</h2>

<p>This does not provide instructions on how to create <code>initramfs</code>, however. Since this is <em>very</em> broad topic (basically, you have to create working Linux userspace environment ant there is really no limit on how complicated it can be), I won't cover this here now. I will only note that <code>initramfs</code> can be used in two different forms - standalone one, where it's separate file and buildin where it is integrated with kernel image file (like it's in <code>kernel_emergency.img</code>). The second option should be supported by RaspberryPi bootloader but there <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=10532&amp;p=192984#p192984"" rel=""nofollow"">some rumors</a> that it's broken on current firmware version so you should probably use buildin version.</p>

<p>The best way to start is to use working initramfs content (that is being used for kernel_emergency.img) by downloading it from another foundation <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/target_fs"" rel=""nofollow"">github repository</a> and only after you are able to boot the kernel using this <code>iniramfs</code> image, try building your own. All that should be needed for this is to point to the downloaded directory uing <code>CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE</code> kernel configuration option.</p>

<h2>Final notes</h2>

<p>So you should do this in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try building and booting kernel without <code>initramfs</code> file.</li>
<li>Try adding ready <code>initramfs</code> content to your kernel.</li>
<li>Change this <code>initramfs</code> content to suit your needs.</li>
</ol>

"Can I use the screen/keyboard of a laptop with the Pi?","14608","","<p>I have a very old, not very fast laptop.

<p>I am mainly looking to control the screen, the keyboard would be an added bonus.</p>

<p>I don't specially want to take the laptop apart, what I'm looking for is some sort of cable and/or program I can run on the laptop, (Windows), that would allow me to use the screen and/or keyboard.</p>

<p>The resolution/quality may not be very good, but that is not an issue.</p>

"Controlling a 12V RGB LED strip with the GPIO","14605","","<p>I have an RGB LED strip (specifically, <a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/products/346"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> one - 1 meter's worth) and a 12V power supply to go along with it, since the raspberry pi alone can not power the strip. I am going to be using <a href=""https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster/"" rel=""nofollow"">pi-blaster</a> to do some PWM to control the colors. I already have GPIO working, but what component(s) do I need to allow the output of the raspberry pi GPIO to control the 12V power input for the RGB LED strip? </p>

<p>I tried N-channel mosfets, but they seemed to not work (I think the ground of the raspberry pi and the ground of the power supply are not the same - but I can't confirm at this time because I can't find my multimeter).</p>
","<p>Whenever you have systems connected together that communicate with each other you must have a common ground! Without this, voltage levels are not referenced to anything and could appear as nearly any voltage to the other device. The only exception to this rule is when you intentionally isolate systems from each other, say for noise reasons. Then you might use an optocoupler for example.</p>

<p>With PWM control you should use your MOSFETs or possibly BJTs. A relay will be too slow to switch using PWMs. To ensure that the two supplies whose grounds you are connecting together are properly grounded, test the voltage difference between the ground terminals before you connect them together. You should see very little voltage. Preferably zero volts. If you see a big voltage here inspect your supplies. If there is a big voltage difference between the grounds, when you connect them together you will have current flowing along the ground plane. This is never a good idea.</p>

<p>Assuming the voltage is negligible, when you connect the grounds together, you then have a common ground against which all voltages in your system can be measured. This should allow you to control the MOSFETS using PWMs generated by the Pi, while they source current from the 12V supply</p>

<p><strong>Also</strong></p>

<p>I forgot to mention that depending on the MOSFETs you are using, you may require a charge pump to achieve the correct gate voltage to switch your MOSFET fully on (if you have them configured as high side switches). There are some MOSFETS that have a built in charge pump so that they can be controlled directly from a micro. I dont know which yours are.</p>

<p>Many manufacturers produce gate driver ICs that create the correct voltages for you. (If you find that you have just regular MOSFETS.)</p>

<p>See this IRF app note for more info on gate drivers.

"Remote Desktop With xrdp","14584","","<p>I have installed xrdp on my Raspberry Pi (which is connected to my TV) and a program called CoRD on my Mac that lets me connect to the RPi remotely and I am able to see the RPi desktop without any issue.</p>

<p>However, the TV screen doesn't show what I am doing. What I mean is that I can create files, change settings, etc (and all that works) but if I open a window on the desktop that CoRD shows on my Mac, that window is not shown on the TV, it just shows the desktop like if I had just logged in. If I create a text file and save it to the desktop, it will show there (the icon will appear when I save the file), but if I open that file the editor window will just show on CoRD and not on the TV.</p>

<p>Is this just how the remote desktop works or is there a way to duplicate what I see in CoRD on the TV display?</p>
","<p>If you're using <code>vino</code> for the VNC portion of xrdp (rather than <code>vnc4server</code>), you could follow <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_VNC_Screen_Sharing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these instructions</a> to enable session sharing: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Log in to your Pi and install the Vino Package</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install vino
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Next Run X11</p>

<pre><code>$ startx
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Once that is done you can run the vino-preferences from the terminal.</p>

<pre><code>$ vino-preferences
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Configure it like you want it to work, if you want to be able to controll the remote Raspberry Pi computer without remote confirmation you have to check booth ""Allow"" boxes on top, uncheck the third ""confirm"" box and as a good recommendation check the 4 box about ""Require user password"" and enter a password you'll remember. The rest isn't that important so just click ""Close"" after that. Now Raspbian doesn't autostart <code>vino</code>, so we have to fix that, make a script in the /etc/sudoers.d folder.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo leafpad /etc/sudoers.d/vsrv.sh &amp;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>put the following in that file.</p>

<pre><code>#! /bin/bash
/usr/lib/vino/vino-server
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Set the file to Execute</p>

<pre><code>$ chmod +x vsrv.sh
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then this file has to autorun when we start X11, on Raspbian this can be done by editing the /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart file:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo leafpad /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart &amp;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Just add this line at the end of the file:</p>

<pre><code>@/etc/sudoers.d/vsrv.sh
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Reboot the Raspberry Pi</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Install <code>xrdp</code> and <code>vino</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install xrdp vino
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Configure vino so that you can remotely connect to the existing session</p>

<p>Type <code>vino-preferences</code> from the terminal, check ""Allow other users to view your desktop,"" ""Allow other users to control your desktop,"" and configure the ""Security"" settings as you like (you will probably want to uncheck ""confirm each access to this machine"" and check ""require the user to enter this password"").</p></li>
<li><p>Configure xrdp to access vino</p>

<p>Edit <code>/etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini</code>, adding in the text below. Alter the name to whatever you fancy. Also, make sure that <code>[xrdp1]</code> uses a number that doesn't conflict with an existing configuration.</p>

"Alternatives to Raspberry PI","14412","","<p>I know this question may have been asked before. I just want to know if there are any alternatives to the Raspberry Pi. I want to use it as an XMBC station, but the reviews tell me that it's a bit buggy as of now. The video forwarding and the loading times are not very good.</p>

<p>What I get from all this is that a Raspberry Pi is a good machine for beginners to learn programming, but power users might want to look somewhere else.</p>

<p>Finally, here is my question: What are some other alternatives to the Raspberry Pi. They must be compatible with any flavor of linux. One I like is PandaBoard. </p>

<p>Any other suggestion like that would be great. Price range is between $0-240</p>
","<p>There are a lot of Embedded Linux boards/systems available, here is an overview.</p>

<p>(This list is by no means complete, anyone that is missing something please add it to the list to make it as complete as possible.)</p>

"How can I setup a Wireless Access point or and Ad-hoc network?","14331","","<p>I would like to connect to my PI through wireless USB dongle, how can I setup an AP or an Ad-Hoc under Arch Linux? </p>
","<p>I know this question asks for instructions on Arch Linux, but since I have been struggling for several days with the exact same issue on Raspbian Wheezy I thought it might be helpful if I shared my solution anyway.</p>

<p>Basically, I ended up creating a solution where my Raspberry Pi (RPi) tries to connect to one of its known wireless networks, and if that do not succeed (WiFi is not in range or the DHCP is not leasing), the RPi creates an encrypted DHCP-enabled ad-hoc network instead. In that way, I can always access the RPi through SSH no matter where the RPi is located.</p>

<p>I use <code>wpa_supplicant</code> for managing the wireless WPA2 connections, and <code>iwconfig</code> for creating the encrypted ad-hoc network (with <code>dhcpd</code> for managing IP leases on the ad-hoc network).</p>

<p>I have compiled a complete tutorial on this subject which can be found here: <a href=""http://lcdev.dk/2012/11/18/raspberry-pi-tutorial-connect-to-wifi-or-create-an-encrypted-dhcp-enabled-ad-hoc-network-as-fallback/"">http://lcdev.dk/2012/11/18/raspberry-pi-tutorial-connect-to-wifi-or-create-an-encrypted-dhcp-enabled-ad-hoc-network-as-fallback/</a></p>

"Error on Boot. 'No working init found.'","14310","","<p>My Raspberry won't boot anymore. I had some problems, with mostly Mysql crashes in the past. But now it won't boot anymore.</p>

<p>The error it gives on boot:</p>

<pre><code>Not syncing: No working init found. Try passing init= option to kernel. See Linux Documentatio/init.txt fot guidance.
</code></pre>

<p>Picture of the whole boot.<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A2VIB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A2VIB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I've found people with this problem, but those are mostly ubuntu and solutions won't seem to apply to debian. I could be wrong on that.</p>

<p>Can anybody point me in the right direction?</p>
","<p>A quick list of possible causes and solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The root filesystem used by the kernel is incorrect.  On the pi this is specified in <code>cmdline.txt</code> (on the first partition) by <code>root=</code> and for Raspbian should be <code>mmcblk0p2</code>.  The <code>rootfstype</code> should be <code>ext4</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Correct the root filesystem parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>The root filesystem is corrupt.  </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Run <code>e2fsck</code> on the root filesystem (using another computer).</p></li>
<li><p>The init file, <code>/sbin/init</code> (sometimes a symlink) or some necessary linked dependency has been moved or erased.  </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> If you did this, put it back.  If you did not, reinstall the OS.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In most cases for most people these are things you can easily check in order, but if this fails, reinstall the OS.  It is unrecoverable by you.</p>

<p>However, in your particular case there appears to be a kernel failure of some sort leading up to this; for a more normal example of a truly missing or bad init, <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/41971/5538"">see here</a>.  So you could try replacing <code>kernel7.img</code> (that's for the Pi 2, which I think this is) with a fresh one, e.g., from a clean image; most likely the required modules will still be installed on your system.</p>

<p>I suggest before you do anything, if possible, you try another SD card with a fresh image on it since this failure could be the result of hardware failure (e.g. bad RAM) and you need to rule that out before you waste time on other things.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Mostly no (as in, they do apply) and yes (i.e., you're wrong), although there is a broad range of possible causes.  Depending on which era you are talking about, Ubuntu and Debian use different <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">init systems</a> (the first paragraph of that article also describes the essence of your problem, which is true regardless of which init system would have been used) -- one of SysV, Upstart (Ubuntu only) or systemd. </p>

"How do I create and mount a partition using the remainder of my SD card?","14258","","<p>I have seen instructions for resizing the partition <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/499/112"">here</a>, but how do I create a whole new partition using the remaining space, and then mount it?</p>
","<p>Using fdisk:</p>

<pre><code>fdisk /dev/sda
</code></pre>

<p>Type n to create a new partition.</p>

<p>Type p to make a primary partition.</p>

<p>Next press enter when prompted for a partition number to choose the next available.</p>

<p>Press enter again to pick the next available sector to start the partition.
Press enter again to use all of the remaining disk space.</p>

<p>Type w to save the changes.</p>

<p>Fdisk will now exit. You am need to reboot in order for the partition to be available.</p>

<p>You can now make a file system for the new partition using the mkfs command.</p>

<pre><code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdax
</code></pre>

<p>Where x is the partition number.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: sometimes when creating a new partition for the sd card there has been a small amount of logical space that takes up the rest of the image. You'll need to use the method in the question you linked to in order to extend that space, or do as I do and just create another partition after it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To mount you use the mount command like this:</p>

<pre><code>mount /dev/sdax /path/to/mount/point
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the partition to mount automatically at boot then you need to add an entry in the /etc/fstab file.</p>

<pre><code>/dev/sdax      /path/to/mount    defaults      1 0

","<p>Under Windows, all you will be able to see is the /boot partition, which is in the MS-DOS VFAT format. Raspbian uses a different file system format for its system files. Here's the (edited) output of <code>df -h</code> on my Raspberry Pi:</p>

<p>My code controlling GPIO output is based on <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#C"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a></p>

<p>The essential part of my code is the following:</p>

<pre><code>speed = 1000000; // 1 MHz, or 0.5 MHz anyway (just notice the order of MHz)
s2us = 1000000; // second to microsecond
while(1){
    GPIO_SET = 1&lt;&lt;7; // set GPIO 07 HIGH
    usleep(1/speed * s2us); // sleep for 1 us
    GPIO_CLR = 1&lt;&lt;7; // set GPIO 07  LOW
    usleep(1/speed * s2us); // sleep for 1 us
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run my code, it shows the square wave with the period of 4.2 ms, which means about only 240 Hz. It's not a tolerable error since the order of hundreds Hz and MHz.</p>

<p>I've googled for this problem and found that <code>usleep</code>, <code>nanosleep</code> cannot work properly if the sleep time is too short since some kind of linux system scheduling. But I have no idea to solve this problem. Some suggest to use <code>delay</code> instead of <code>sleep</code> but I'm not sure it will work or not.</p>

"How compile a loadable kernel module without recompiling kernel","14055","","<p>I have read quite a bit about how to compile a kernel module on (and for) the Raspberry Pi, but I'm still not quite able to figure out why it's not working.  I have been able to build the module, but it reports <code>Invalid module format</code> when I try to <code>insmod</code> the result.  Here is the process I followed.  First, as root under <code>/root</code> I executed the following shell script:</p>

<h1>getKernel.sh</h1>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/bash
FIRMWARE_HASH=$(zgrep ""* firmware as of"" /usr/share/doc/raspberrypi-bootloader/changelog.Debian.gz | head -1 | awk '{ print $5 }')

cd linux
git checkout $KERNEL_HASH

zcat /proc/config.gz &gt;.config
make oldconfig
make modules_prepare

<p>The first few lines are from <a href=""http://lostindetails.com/blog/post/Compiling-a-kernel-module-for-the-raspberry-pi-2"">http://lostindetails.com/blog/post/Compiling-a-kernel-module-for-the-raspberry-pi-2</a></p>

<p>The rest I wrote to automate more of the process. Once all of that runs successfully, I have the source that should exactly match the running kernel, the configuration to match and a symlink.  There were some redirects from the github web location (apparently it's now <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/"">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/</a> ) but no actual errors.</p>

<p>Then I become the default <code>pi</code> user and in a directory named <code>/home/pi/projects/lkm</code> I have this source code for a very simple toy module:</p>

<h1>hello.c</h1>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;

   printk(KERN_INFO ""Hello, world.\n"");
   return 0;
}

static void __exit hello_exit(void){
   printk(KERN_INFO ""Goodbye, world.\n"");
}

module_init(hello_init);
module_exit(hello_exit);
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I build the module with this Makefile</p>

<h1>Makefile</h1>

<pre><code>MODSRC=/home/pi/projects/lkm

<p>Finally, I attempt to load the module:</p>

<pre><code>sudo insmod hello.ko

<p>The result, however, is disappointing:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to further troubleshoot this or fix it.  Any clues?</p>
","<p>First of all, make sure you use the proper kernel headers. I assume that your kernel headers and source code are more updated than the kernel you're running. </p>

<p>Try to do an <code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade</code> then reinstall the module. If the problem persists, triple check that your kernel headers match your current kernel, recompile again then try to install.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: I'm using Jessie.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Run these as root.</p>

<pre><code># The usual update routine
apt-get update -y
apt-get upgrade -y

# Update the kernel!
rpi-update
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to reboot. After that, proceed with the commands below, still using the root account.</p>

<pre><code># Get rpi-source
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notro/rpi-source/master/rpi-source -O /usr/bin/rpi-source

# Make it executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-source

# Tell the update mechanism that this is the latest version of the script
/usr/bin/rpi-source -q --tag-update

# Get the kernel files thingies.
rpi-source
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>rpi-source</code> throws a GCC error (something about a version mismatch), it's okay <strong>as long as your current GCC version is higher</strong>. Run <code>rpi-source --skip-gcc</code> instead of <code>rpi-source</code></p>

<p>Then, proceed with your Hello World example. Create the folder and <code>cd</code> into it. Then, create the files.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir hello
cd hello
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Files:</h2>

<p><strong>hello.c</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;

int hello_init(void)
{
    pr_alert(""Hello World :)\n"");
    return 0;
}
void hello_exit(void)
{
    pr_alert(""Goodbye World!\n"");
}
module_init(hello_init);
module_exit(hello_exit);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Makefile</strong> (case-sensitive?)</p>

<pre><code>obj-m := hello.o
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Now that you have your files, you can go ahead and run the usual Hello World build commands:</p>

<pre><code>make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$(pwd) modules
insmod hello.ko
</code></pre>

<p>You should now check <code>dmesg</code>. The last line should print <code>Hello World :)</code> highlighted in red.</p>

<p>If you do, congratulations. You just made and installed a kernel module.</p>

<p>Now remove it using  <code>rmmod hello</code>. <code>dmesg</code> should now print <code>Goodbye World!</code> highlighted in red.</p>

"How to shrink an image file after allocating full space","14045","","<p>I'm in the process of experimenting with backing up a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) sd card. I'm using Win32DiskImager to read the image (from SD card reader) onto my HDD, successfully - but now the size issue. The image is just bigger than the original SD card and can only be written back to a bigger SD card, which, if you back that up has the same problem.</p>

<p>After creating an .img file, how can I remove all the unused space again?
(is this because I used raspi-config to allocate all available space to the root?)</p>

<p>I tried to get an idea of what the partition(s) look like with Cygwin, but can't manage to get fdisk working (-bash: fdisk: command not found) - (after reading <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/7177/image-of-a-16gb-card-containing-unpartitioned-space-at-the-end-truncating-possi"">Image of a 16Gb card containing unpartitioned space at the end: Truncating possible?</a>)</p>
","<p>So the best way I have found is to use GParted (you can either use a Linux-based OS, or boot from a GParted Live USB). It is simple enough to find detailed instructions on how to do each of these steps in detail, but here is the general method I have found to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run GParted, find your SD card in the device list and shrink the main partition to as small as it will go.</li>
<li>Take the value of the last sector of this partition and multiply this by the sector size (512 for me; I presume this is standard, although you can check this in GParted settings for your device): this will give you the total size in bytes to copy.</li>
<li>Divide the total number of bytes by 4096 (round up if you need to - better to take a bit more space than not enough), and this will give you the 'count' to then enter into the following command at the terminal in a Linux environment (You can probably do this from the GParted Live USB operating system terminal or in Cygwin without sudo so long as you are running it as an administrator):</li>
</ol>

<p><code>sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/path/to/your/file.img bs=4k count=&lt;count&gt;</code></p>

<p>Change the input device location if you need to. This should give you a final image file that is the smallest that it can be, omitting empty space.</p>

<p>After that I disabled the GUI by opening a terminal and doing:
<code>sudo raspi-config</code>
the same interface as before showed up and just disabled it there. </p>

<p>Then I clicked <em>Finish</em> and typed <code>exit</code> to close the terminal, then I mouse clicked the ""start"" icon and rebooted normally. Perhaps I could have rebooted from the terminal but I didn't want to risk it.</p>

<p>What you could do though, is to have a shell script, located in <code>/boot</code>, that sets which operating system you want to use on the next boot.</p>

<p>You could accomplish this by storing the boot files for different operating systems in another directory, like so.</p>

<p>I need to record audio through the Pi and I didn't find anything conclusive about its audio capabilities. Would like to make sure before searching for a sound card.</p>
","<p>You cannot record sound through the 3.5 jack of the Pi right now. See here <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#audioStandard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#audioStandard</a></p>

<p>As an alternative you can use a sound card like the <a href=""http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-accessories/wolfson_pi"" rel=""nofollow"">Wolfson</a> or a USB microphone/sound card.
If you go with the Wolfson (which is the option I went with) there are two important things to know before you buy:</p>

<ul>
<li>It does <strong>not</strong> work with the B+ version of the Pi, which is really the only one getting stocked right now</li>
<li>Unless you're up for compiling your own kernel, you're going to have to use Raspbian 3.10 or so</li>
<li>You won't be able to record at rates below 32kHz; this seems to be a bug that they're working on fixing. You can downsample, but that will just put more strain on your CPU, so that doesn't seem like a great option to me.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even given all the above, the Wolfson works pretty well for my purposes. If you already have a Pi, I would recommend the Wolfson if you have an A or a B, and a USB card/mic if you have a B+. If you don't have one, you're probably better off sticking with a USB option for now, since it will be extra work locating a deprecated Pi for no real benefit.</p>

"Cooling fan powered directly from GPIO?","13886","","<p>I have a Pi3 in a fairly enclosed environment, and I found that, even when my Pi was relatively idle (5% CPU usage) the CPU temp was averaging around 80C, which is close to the 85C where the Pi starts to underclock and the 90C where the Pi starts to get damaged. Since I'm planning some more processor-hungry tasks, I want beef up the cooling, if only for performance reasons.</p>

<p>I already have a heatsink on the Pi's main chip, so I'm considering adding a very small fan. I found that even slightly blowing on the chip immediately takes the temp down to 60, so it's entirely an air-flow problem, so even a very weak tiny fan should work.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have any more room to add a power regulator to supply the fan, so I need to power it directly from the Pi's 5V power rail and controlled via a GPIO pin. What are the fan specs I should be looking for so it doesn't exceed the Pi's max current? Is anyone aware of any very tiny and silent 3.3V or 5V fans suitable for this?</p>
","<p>You can power a small 5v fan off the 5V and the GND pins on Raspberry's GPIO pins.  Check the GPIO layout <a href=""https://www.element14.com/community/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/73950-102-8-339300/pi3_gpio.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>For example, I know that B-Frames are often not handled well (or at all) on many mobile devices and the same is true for the CABAC encoding scheme.</p>
","<p>To answer your question, any H.264 encoding will work perfectly on the Raspberry Pi. So you have to select (whatever profile you pick, best high profile or normal) the H.264 option in the tab <strong>Video</strong> under <strong>Video codec</strong>. For audio use AAC (supported) and pick stereo (Dolby surround doesn't work).</p>

<p>Using those settings (tested it myself) everything plays nice and smooth, no problems at all. Other options like frame rate can influence the movie a lot, a guide on frame rate: <a href=""https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/FramerateGuide"">https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/FramerateGuide</a></p>

<p>I think that will help you, remember video codec on H.264 and audio on stereo AAC. Check your frame rate and other options will generally affect the size of the video.</p>

I have <strong>ntfs-3g</strong> installed on <strong>jessie-lite</strong>. </p>

<p>Putting the UUID in <code>fstab</code> is not an option because I'd have to find the UUID of every device. I want to be able to plug different USB devices with different file-formats in and mount them automatically. Is this possible?</p>

<p>Also I once nearly got it working with the <code>usbmount</code> program. I could access my drive for a second before getting the error <code>transport endpoint is not connected</code>. I reinstalled the program but then I never even got to that point again, not even with the error.</p>
","<p>After alot of research I could fix my Problem with usbmount:</p>

<h2>Adding ntfs to usbmount</h2>

<ol>
<li>Install usbmount with <code>sudo apt-get install usbmount</code>.</li>
<li><p>Install NTFS driver package <strong>ntfs-3g</strong> with <code>sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure usbmount to mount specified filesystems by opening the usbmount file with <code>sudo nano /etc/usbmount/usbmount.conf</code>. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>In here there is a line called <code>FILESYSTEMS=""""</code>. Only filesystems specified in this line are mounted via usbmount, so we change it to : <code>FILESYSTEMS=""vfat ntfs fuseblk ext2 ext3 ext4 hfsplus""</code></p>

<p>If you want usbmount to mount NTFS Filesystems, be sure to add
<strong>ntfs</strong> and <strong>fuseblk</strong> to the line. NTFS devices are sometimes listed as <em>fusblk</em> by the ntfs-3g package, so those two are the same. I don't really know why though.</p>

<p>Also, if you don't add <strong>fuseblk</strong> in the configuration, unplugged NTFS Devices will <strong>not</strong> automatically unmount. They will stay mounted and keep the folder they are mounted to until the device is manually unmounted with <code>unmount /dev/sda1</code>  --> <em>where sda1 could be another variable</em>.</p>

<p>The next important line is <code>FS_MOUNTOPTIONS=""""</code>. Here you specify which filesystems should be mounted and how they should be mounted.</p>

<p>We change it to: <code>FS_MOUNTOPTIONS=""-fstype=ntfs-3g,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46
-fstype=fuseblk,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 -fstype=vfat,gid=1000,uid=1000,umask=007""</code></p>

<p>With this the filesystems <strong>vfat</strong> (fat32) <strong>ntfs-3g</strong> (NTFS), and
<strong>fuseblk</strong> (NTFS again) are mounted. I think most parameters can stay the same. Again here just add ntfs-3g (<strong>add ntfs-3g not ntfs</strong>) and fuseblk to be able to mount all NTFS Files. For more filesystems add more lines starting with <code>-fstype=</code>.</p>

<h2>Keep NTFS mounted untill device is unplugged</h2>

<p>Here is a solution for the problem, when the mounted NTFS drive is only accessible for a few seconds. This fix comes from <strong>Christian Weinberger</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the file <strong>usbmount.rules</strong> in <strong>/etc/udev/rules.d/</strong> with <code>sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/usbmount.rules</code>.</li>

<ol>
<li>Create the file <strong>usbmount@.service</strong> in <strong>/etc/systemd/system/</strong> with <code>sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/usbmount@.service</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the content:</p>

"How to mount the EXT4 partition on the SD card from within VirtualBox","13702","","<p>I have an SD Card reader built into my Lenovo laptop and I've installed VirtualBox and Debian squeeze to a VM but I can't seem to view the EXT4 partition, or any partition for that matter, on the SD card!</p>

<p>I asked this question:
<a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/967/85"">Change IP settings by mounting the SD Card in another computer</a></p>

<p>And the suggested answers involve mounting the SD card in a virtual machine.</p>
","<h2>Internal Card Reader - Not USB - Windows 7 Host</h2>

<p>My laptop has a built-in Card Reader and doesn't appear as a USB device. To get it to work I had to mount the EXT4 partition as RAW before assigning it to the VM and then booting the VM.</p>

<p>First thing I noticed was if I opened the <strong>Disk Management</strong> utility under <strong>Computer Management</strong> - Right click on My Computer and select <strong>Manage</strong> you should be able to see the SD card as a disk and as Kibbee mentioned mine also had three partitions, I guessed the larger middle partition is the one that I was after. </p>

<p>To mount the raw partition within VirtualBox you need to know the disk &amp; partition number. I confirmed these first using the windows command line utility <strong>Diskpart</strong> and the <code>list disk</code> command (on my laptop, and in Disk Management, the SD Card appeared as #1)</p>

<p>To identify the partitions correctly, I used the VirtualBox command <code>listpartitions</code> here's mine as an example:</p>

<pre><code>vboxmanage internalcommands listpartitions -r awdisk \\.\PhysicalDrive1
</code></pre>

<p>And the output for me was:</p>

<pre><code>Number  Type   StartCHS       EndCHS      Size (MiB)  Start (Sect)
1       0x0c  16  /0  /1   1023/3  /32            75         2048
2       0x83  1023/3  /32  1023/3  /32          1590       157696
3       0x82  1023/3  /32  1023/3  /32           191      3416064
</code></pre>

<p>From this I'm guessing the partition 2 is the EXT4 partition I'm trying to get access to.</p>

<h1>Mounting the Partition as a raw volume</h1>

<p>To make the raw partition available to the Linux guest, VirtualBox allows you to submit the <code>createrawvmdk</code> command which creates a file with a .vmdk extension that you can then specify as an existing disk from the VM's storage settings. Again, here's mine as an example:</p>

<pre><code>vboxmanage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename 
C:\VirtualMachines\Debian\disk1_part2.vmdk -rawdisk \\.\PhysicalDrive1
-partitions 2
</code></pre>

<p>(you can leave out the ""-partitions 2"" parameter to enable all partitions on the device.)</p>

<h1>Adding the raw disk to the VM</h1>

<p>Before starting the VM</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the VM's Settings dialog, select <strong>Storge</strong></li>
<li>Right click <strong>SATA Controller</strong> and click <strong>Add Hard Disk</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Choose Existing Disk</strong> button and browse to the file created in the previous step.</li>
</ul>

<p>You're now be able to boot the VM and have access to the EXT4 partition.</p>

<h1>Problems with User Account Control</h1>

<p>If the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the host system is running Windows Vista, 7 or 8 (or perhaps Windows
Server 2008R2/2012)</li>
<li>User Account Control is enabled</li>
<li>and you haven't modified permissions regarding raw disk access</li>
</ul>

<p>then the above operation might fail, even if you're an Administrator.
This is due to the fact that non-administrators will not have access to raw devices.</p>

<p>I see 4 possible solutions, none of which are very nice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disabling User Account Control might fix it (I haven't tested that).</li>
<li>It might be possible to assign permissions for users to access raw devices; however I wouldn't recommend this as it's extremely insecure.</li>
<li>You can run VirtualBox as an Administrator (right click, select ""Run as administrator""); you have to do this both while creating and using the device.</li>
<li>....or buying a USB card reader and attach it directly as a USB device.</li>
</ul>

  <p>The quick way: assign a static IP address to your Pi.

I haven't tried this myself, but here's some instructions from Andrew Munsell. He's using 192.168.1.222 for his Pi, since that's outside the range assigned by his router. Change this address to whatever suits.</p>
  
  <p>You can do this in Debian Squeeze on the Raspberry by modifying the /etc/network/interfaces file.</p>
  
  <p>I removed the original <code>iface eth0</code> line and replaced it with the following:</p>

<pre><code>iface eth0 inet static

<p>Any ideas? May be something like making serial console work over GPIO?</p>
","<p>It can be hard to learn writing drivers when interfacing with complicated devices and/or complicated buses. Because of that I would recommend either using some simple and well known devices (ignoring existing implementation of their drivers in the kernel) like I²C/SPI devices that are usually used with microcontrollers. For example you could find any device that is ""supported"" by Arduino community (meaning there is a library/documentation for it) and try using it with RaspberryPi.</p>

<p>If that's not enough or you don't want to buy too much hardware, you can create one yourself. Just get some microcontroller (like atmega or something), create a program for it to become some device and then try interfacing with it using Linux drivers. This way you can easily create programs that will emulate different classes of devices. And since you will write your ""firmware"" yourself, it will help you debug problems. </p>

<p>You need some microcontroller programming skills for that but it's not hard to learn programming with Arduino and I believe it's useful knowledge for driver programmer anyway. </p>

"Accessing gpio pins using c program in raspberry pi","13628","","<p>I am using raspberry pi with Debian Wheezy 18-09-2012 image. I can access gpio pins with Wiring pi tool. But I would like to know is any other method that we can access gpio pins directly without wiring pi?</p>

<p>When I run the following command on terminal</p>

<pre><code>echo 0 &gt;/sys/class/gpio/export
</code></pre>

<p>it shows </p>

<pre><code>-bash: /sys/class/gpio/export: Permission denied
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any solution for this?</p>

<p>I also tried the following script</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

echo ""4"" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export
echo ""out"" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/direction

while true
do
        echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value
        echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value
done
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://codeandlife.com/topics/raspberry-pi/"">from here</a> and i get the same error.</p>

<p>I would like to run the code on C because right now I am not familiar with both Java and Python.</p>
","<p>Yes, there are at least two of them:</p>

<h1>GPIO kernel module</h1>

<p>The full documentation of this subsystem can be found <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/gpio.txt"">here</a> (look for <code>Sysfs Interface for Userspace</code> subsection). Basically, kernel exports some files in <code>/sys/class/gpio/</code> directory. Here's an example usage (using pin 0 as an input and then switching it as output and setting to 1):</p>

<pre><code># echo 0 &gt;/sys/class/gpio/export
# echo in &gt;/sys/class/gpio/gpio0/direction
# cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio0/value
# echo out &gt;/sys/class/gpio/gpio0/direction
# echo 1 &gt;/sys/class/gpio/gpio0/value
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note, that in normal case, you need root permissions to do this.</strong></p>

<p>Since all this is just a file operations, it can be easily done in C program with <code>open()</code>/<code>read()</code>/<code>write()</code> functions. Be careful when using <code>fopen()</code>/<code>fread()</code>/<code>fwrite</code> functions since they use buffered I/O.</p>

<h1>Directly using registers</h1>

<p>This one, I believe, is being used by wiringPi itself. It uses <code>/dev/mem</code> device to access physical RaspberryPi memory and to operate on BCM2835 memory mapped registers directly. In order to use it, you would have to read <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf"">BCM2835 datasheet</a> (<code>General Purpose I/O (GPIO)</code> section). It is not that trivial however. <strong>Note, that you need root permissions to do this.</strong></p>

<p>There's also one more C library that uses this way, you can find it <a href=""http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835/"">here</a>. It does much more than only manipulating GPIO but since it's quite simple, it should be easy to extract only the GPIO code and understand how it's working.</p>

","<p>A 40-pin HDD cable will probably <em>not</em> fit.  They often have pin 20 obstructed (so it must be absent from the male connector) to prevent the connector from being plugged in the wrong way round.</p>

<p>You can usually use a 34-pin floppy cable. But remember that a group of seven wires is usually twisted (i.e. connected in the opposite order from one end of the cable to the other.) (further explained <a href=""http://www.pcguide.com/ref/fdd/confCable-c.html"">here</a>.)  Don't forget to adjust the pinout on the slave board to compensate!</p>

"GPIO Pin Explanation","13514","","<p>My Pi 2 kit came with the following GPIO pin reference card.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gQqCr.jpg"" alt=""Pi GPIO Header Quick Reference""></p>

<p>In addition to showing all of the 5V, 3.3V, GND, and GPIO pin numbers, it has additional information on some of the GPIO pins like TXD, RXD, UART, CLK, PCM, DE0, CE1, SPI, DIN, DOUT, PCM, SDA, SCL, I2C, MOSI, MISO, SCLK, SPI, PCM, FS along with various colors on these.</p>

<p>What does all of this mean? I am assuming these are special pins for something. Are not all of the GPIOs usable in the same way?</p>
","<p>The <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf"">Broadcom datasheet</a> linked from raspberrypi.org in Boštjan Jerko answer is a great reference; for example, section 6.2 describes the various functions that can be assigned to each pin as per joan's answer.  To summarize the meaning of the ones indicated on your card:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>I<sup>2</sup>C, SDA &amp; SCL:</strong> In the Broadcom datasheet these are only mentioned directly in that section 6.2 table, but they are for an I<sup>2</sup>C bus, which is discussed in the section on the BSC (Broadcom serial controller).  The 'DA' in SDA stands for data, the 'CL' in SCL stands for clock; the S stands for serial.  You can do more reading about the significance of the clock line for various types of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)"">computer bus</a>, but you do not have to understand it on that level to use it -- as joan says, there are programming libraries that abstract that away.  You will probably find I<sup>2</sup>C devices that come with their own userspace drivers and the linux kernel includes some as well.  Most computers have an I<sup>2</sup>C bus, presumably for some of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C#Applications"">purposes listed by wikipedia</a>, such as interfacing with the RTC (real time clock) and configuring memory.  However, it is not exposed, meaning you can't attach anything else to it, and there are a lot of interesting things that could be attached -- pretty much any kind of common sensor (barometers, accelerometers, gyroscopes, luminometers, etc.) as well as output devices and displays.  You can buy a USB to I<sup>2</sup>C adapter for a normal computer, <em>but they cost a few hundred dollars</em>.  You can attach multiple devices to the exposed bus on the pi.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>UART, TXD &amp; RXD:</strong> This is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter"">traditional serial line</a>; for decades most computers have had a port for this and a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_communication"">port for parallel</a>.<sup>1</sup>  Some pi oriented OS distros such as Raspbian by default boot with this serial line active as a console, and you can plug the other end 
into another computer and use some appropriate software to communicate with it.  Note this interface does not have a clock line; the two pins may be used for full duplex communication (simultaneous transmit and receive).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PCM, CLK/DIN/DOUT/FS:</strong> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation"">PCM</a> is is how uncompressed digital audio is encoded.  The data stream is serial, but interpreting this correctly is best done with a separate clock line (more lowest level stuff).   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>SPI, MOSI/MISO/CE0/CE1:</strong> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus"">SPI</a> is a serial bus protocol serving many of the same purposes as I<sup>2</sup>C, but because there are more wires, it can operate in full duplex which makes it faster and more flexible.</p></li>

<p><sup>1. The pi actually does not have any particular style of parallel bus exposed, but presumably you could implement one with the some of the pins.</sup></p>

<p>What is it and what does it do? How is that different from just formatting on Windows? I have used both FAT16 and FAT32 SD cards preformated from factory and this option didn't seem to change their filesystems.</p>
","<p>When you use something like Win32DiskImager to prepare an SD card, all you are doing is taking the image file of the distribution you want to use and applying that image to your SD card. </p>

<p>If you have used DD, this is basically the same process. 
The Image files of all of the RPi distros contain a FAT16 partition and an EXT3 partition (versions of FAT and EXT might vary from distro to distro). You are just laying down the image onto the new disk, making it an exact copy of the developer's disk. On first boot you should have an option to resize the EXT3 partition to fill whatever space your SD card has left. </p>

<p>The NOOBS instructions are just formatting the whole card to FAT16, and copying a FAT16 based distro onto it. (rather than splitting the SD card into a FAT16 '/boot' partition and an EXT3 Linux '/' partition.
The advantage of using the SD card formatter over Windows' built-in formatting is that the only option is to format it as FAT and it will only let you format an SD card so there are fewer ways for a N00b to go wrong with the NOOBS instructions. If you are using a brand new SD card you shouldn't have to use the Format step at all, it should be ready to roll. Just copy the NOOBS files onto it.</p>

<p>Debug this by letting the system start up and the wifi ""settle"" (ie. you start to see the wifi ssid broadcasts). Log into the PI and manually do a dhcpd restart. Check your logs again to see if its still throwing the interface ignored error even then.</p>

<p>If that still causes you grief, skip wifi altogether and just try to get it working on the ethernet port so that you can be sure that your dhcpd settings are working right. Then add the complication of a wifi AP.</p>

"Show IO value on webpage in realtime","13317","","<p>I would need to check the value of a IO pin in realtime over the LAN. Since I need to do it from differnet devices (pc, palm, iphone, Samsung galaxy etc) I was thinking of a webpage. The value can be at maximum 0.5 seconds old. And has to refresh itself continuously. How can this be done? </p>
","<p>In order to get a web page to update itself, you need to communicate back to the server from the client without the user doing anything (and remember, web relations mean the server can't send the client anything until the client asks for it).  There are a few different mechanisms you can use to do this:<sup>1</sup></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Java applets. Applets are great, but unfortunately a long history of security problems and other technical issues hampered their acceptance and today they aren't used much, and some mobile platforms (e.g. Android) don't support them at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Flash.  Adobe has obsoleted flash because of HTML 5, but it's still widely used and available in most if not all browsers. I assume Microsoft Silverlight has similar capabilities to flash here, but it has even less broswer support than Java.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Javascript.</strong> Javascript is ubiquitous and standard on all modern browsers.  It's also better integrated with normal HTML content than the other things in this list.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Javascript is probably the way to go, so here's some suggestions involving that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Timer:  This is the simplest method, but also the clunkiest, most limited, and least likely to work well.  You add this to the HTML &lt;body&gt; somewhere:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    setTimeout (
        function() { window.location.reload(); },
        500
    )
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This just reloads the page every 500 milliseconds; each time the server would generate content dynamically. <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's a reference</a> for js timers.  If you do this, you want the page url itself to be non-cachable, but any CSS files and images to be cached.  It still won't be the most bandwidth friendly method, but unless the page is huge the difference between this and ajax shouldn't be too great.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AJAX requests</a>: These can happen behind the scenes to contact the server.  You could do this with a timer; the repetitive version of <code>setTimer()</code> is <code>setInterval()</code>, although you are probably better off calling <code>setTimer()</code> repeatedly when the data returns.  AJAX implementations can differ slightly from browser to browser, so it's a good idea to use a portable library such as <a href=""http://jquery.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jquery</a>.  Here's an example of a jquery based ajax request:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax ({
    url: /request/path,
    success: function (data) {
        // Update the page with 'data'
    }
})
</code></pre>

<p>An alternative to using a timer would be to use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">long-polling</a>, whereby you send a request to the server, the server times the response, then as soon as you receive it, you send another request.  Actually getting a 1/2 second timing over the WWW this way won't be easy, but it should be fine on a local LAN.</p></li>
<li><p>Websockets: The web socket protocol is fairly recent but widely supported -- the live updates on this site are done with web sockets.<sup>2</sup>  It allows you to make a persistent two-way direct connection to the server, meaning both parties can send and receive data arbitrarily.  This requires it to be event driven, like many things in javascript.  You would create a new websocket client side in js like this:</p>

<pre><code>var wsock = new WebSocket(""ws://localhost/foo/bar"");
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, you need server side support too.  I would assume all mainstream HTTP servers, and the various technologies commonly used with them (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12203443/is-native-php-support-for-web-sockets-available/12204603#12204603"">PHP</a>, <a href=""https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/websockets/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">django</a>, <a href=""http://jjnapiorkowski.typepad.com/modern-perl/2013/06/new-catalyst-release-on-cpan-support-for-websockets-event-loops-and-more.html#.Uq76jHVDsR0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">catalyst</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4767268/best-ruby-on-rails-websocket-tool/4768098#4768098"">ruby on rails</a>, <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/websocket.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">java</a>, whatever)<sup>3</sup> have some implementation.  You can't do this via CGI as it is actually not an HTTP exchange. Getting back to the client side, the Websocket object uses callbacks to handle events:</p>

<pre><code> wsock.onmessage = function (data) {
      // Update the page here
 }
</code></pre>

<p>That responds to a message sent from the server. Since this is two-way, the client doesn't have to request anything, but if you do want to send a message to the server: <code>wsock.send(text)</code>.  A websocket is by far the most bandwidth friendly method because the messages by-pass the need for an HTTP header.  It should also give the best latency and most precise timing because it is guaranteed to be a persistent socket connection.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, because this is a newer technique than the other two, it's the least documented.  The W3C draft version of the client side API is <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-websockets-20110929/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  I recommend you look around for tutorials or references involving your preferred server side language/technology and work from there.  The client stuff is about as simple as what's shown here; the server side should be a reciprocal of that.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><sup>1. Not mentioned is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">meta refresh header</a> (see HeatFanJon's answer); this is functionally the same as the javascript timer but the granularity is in seconds.</sup></p>

<p><sup>2. If you have a specific mobile browser you like to use you should investigate that first -- and don't rely on this page working as a sign, because I think it falls back on long-polling if websockets aren't available.  There is <a href=""http://websocketstest.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a test site here</a>; notably the basic Android browser doesn't support it (but chrome and firefox on android do).  Safari on IOS works. </sup></p>

<p><sup>3. The server-side implementation I've used myself is a custom one (the specification is not complex), but I did some googling of popular web frameworks (catalyst = perl, django = python) to see what's available; they all have something.  However, traditional web servers like apache were not intended to deal with two way persistent connections, and it looks like apache's official support for it may be via <a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_wstunnel.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proxying to another backend server</a>, which is not a bad thing.  Some of the modules (e.g. ""tornado"" for python) will make this simple enough; if the purpose of the server is mostly just this, you could just implement a simple, event based HTTP server in python/perl/PHP/ruby using the a websocket module and skip apache altogether.</sup></p>

"Why does USB port enumeration change?","13288","","<p>I'm using a Huawei GMS/UMTS USB modem with Gnokii and Gammu. 
The modem was in the lower port on Pi. With <code>dmesg | grep tty</code> it would show up on <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> and <code>/dev/ttyUSB1</code>. (2 USB devices on 1 stick is normal, in this case).</p>

<p>I configured Gnokii and Gammu accordingly, however on ttyUSB0 I could only send messages. Both sending and receiving would only work over ttyUSB1. </p>

<p>I then moved the stick to the upper USB socket (because otherwise my WiFi-stick wouldn't fit next to it). Everything kept working fine. Also after several reboots, cold and warm. </p>

<p>I then needed to expand the file system (Yeah, I know I should have done that earlier). After that, the modem was on ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB*<em>2</em>*. Send/receive worked on the latter. This took me some time to find out. </p>

<p>Update: 2 days later, ttyUSB2 has disappeared. The working modem now manifests itself on ttyUSB0 (was ttyUSB1). </p>

<p>Any idea why this happened? Any links to relevant debian or linux docs, perhaps? 
I'd be much obliged..</p>
","<p><a href=""http://wammu.eu/docs/manual/faq/general.html#device-name-always-changes-on-linux-how-to-solve-that"" rel=""nofollow"">The Gammu documentation</a> suggests (but doesn't go into any detail of) a workaround,  </p>

<p>Edit: Atmel has an <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc4290.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Application Note</a> that nicely describes the enumeration process. </p>

<p>Enumeration changes because it happens in a conversation between host, hub and device, and response timing from each of these may vary, <em>even</em> if the setup is identical from one reboot to the next. </p>

<p>Update: The solution is not easily found on line, and scattered in pieces all over the place. So I put it all together in <a href=""http://rolfblijleven.blogspot.nl/2015/02/howto-persistent-device-names-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">one document</a>. This is what it boils down to.<br>
1. find out what's on ttyUSB: </p>

<pre><code>dmesg | grep ttyUSB  
</code></pre>

<p>2. list all attributes of the device and pick out a unique identifier set, eg idVendor +  idProduct (and if necessary SerialNumber if you have more than one device with the same idVendor and idProduct).</p>

<pre><code>udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB1 --attribute-walk
</code></pre>

<p>3. Create a file <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules</code> with something like this line in it:  </p>

<pre><code>SUBSYSTEM==""tty"", ATTRS{idVendor}==""1234"", ATTRS{idProduct}==""5678"", SYMLINK+=""your_device_name"" 
</code></pre>

<p>(assuming you don't need a serial number there, and of course with the numbers for idVendor and idProduct that you found in step 2.<br>
4. Load the new rule:  </p>

<pre><code>sudo udevadm trigger
</code></pre>

<p>5. Verify what happened:  </p>

<pre><code>ls -l /dev/your_device_name  
</code></pre>

<p>will show what ttyUSB number the symlink went to. If it's <code>/dev/ttyUSB1</code>, then verify who owns that and to which group it belongs: </p>

<pre><code>ls -l /dev/ttyUSB1   
</code></pre>

<p>Then just for the fun of it: </p>

<pre><code>udevadm test -a -p  $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/your_device_name)

","<p>The short answer is <strong>yes</strong>. The pull up resistor ensures a valid logic level when the pins are switching from input to output, you won't melt anything but it may not function correctly. so you should add a 4.7K - 10KΩ resistor between the Data pin and the VCC pin.  </p>

"How can I control a 12V motor?","13200","","<p>I would like to control (switch) some 12V DC motors using the GPIO pins. I do not have (or want to use) an expansion board. Nevertheless, I think this should be possible using a transistor switch (and some resistors). So, assuming an external 12V DC power supply and motor, what is the best (and safest) way to wire a control circuit to the GPIO pins, and exactly what kind of transistor should I use? In the first instance I'm interested in relatively low power motors (say, 12W/1A), but could be interested in higher power motors in the future.</p>
","<p>Easiest for one direction is to use a logic level mosfet. No resistors needed</p>

<p>Here is a basic circuit from the ardiuno.cc forums</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ZHB2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The IRLZ44N may be overkill for your motor, but still isn't very expensive and <em>will</em> work ok even if the motor is stalled. Also remember that the stall current might be 10A or more.</p>

<p>Many of the cheaper/less powerful parts are surface mount. </p>

<p>The diode(D1) is there to prevent the back EMF from the motor from damaging Q1</p>

<p>The resistor(R1) is there to make sure the IRLZ44N is turned off if the signal is floating. I'm not sure what the GPIO startup state is - the resistor may not be needed.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to reverse the motor, you should use an H-Bridge</p>

<p>As you go to higher power motors, you will find that big mosfets have less sensitive gate, so you'll need a driver between the GPIO and the gate to make sure the mosfet is turned on hard enough</p>

"Pin applications to task-bar on Raspberry Pi 2","13169","","<p>I just recently got a raspberry pi 2, and in a mistaken blunder, I wiped all of the default applications (file manager, terminal, mathematica, wolram, etc.) from the taskbar.</p>

<p><strong><em>Is there any way to manually pin applications to the task-bar?</em></strong> I would like to pin applications such as the terminal and file manager back up to the task-bar.</p>

<p><em>My raspberry pi 2 is running standard Rasbian. I have low-level experience with terminal, as I am a native windows 7 user.</em></p>
","<p>LXDE (the desktop of Raspbian) uses LXPanel. LXPanel has several ""applets"" that aren't actually connected to each other. The ""pinned&nbsp;applications"" (whose official name is ""Application&nbsp;Launch&nbsp;Bar"") applet is one, for example. Another one is the ""Task&nbsp;Bar&nbsp;(Window&nbsp;List)"". In Windows, those are nicely integrated, but not in LXDE, where different applets share practically nothing. If you wanted to ""pin"" a program, you would have to go to the settings of the application launcher, add the application manually (which in some cases means writing your own <code>.desktop</code> files). That is then completely unrelated to the window switcher icon. These features do have some upsides, though. Remember how in Windows, you were forced to that same panel layout all the time? Not the case here. You can move things around however you like. In Windows, all applications had was the system tray icon. In Linux, there is a tray, but applications can easily add their own applets that can be much more powerful that a tray icon.</p>

<p>All these applets can be added or removed from the panel. You seem to have accidentally removed the pinned applications applet. To re-add that, follow these super simple step by step instructions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Right click anywhere on the panel. </li>
<li>Click ""Add&nbsp;/&nbsp;Remove&nbsp;Panel&nbsp;Items"". </li>
<li>Click ""Add"". </li>
<li>Find ""Application&nbsp;Launch&nbsp;Bar"" in the list. </li>
<li>Select it and click ""Add"". It should appear on the very end. </li>
<li>Click ""Up"" until it is above ""Minimize&nbsp;All&nbsp;Windows"" but below the ""Spacer"" above it. </li>
<li>Now click ""Preferences"". It should show 2 columns, the 1st one containing displayed apps and the second containing the remaining ones.</li>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<h1>Quick Background</h1>

<p>The current version of Raspbian is 8, aka. jessie.  Raspbian is Debian compiled for the Pi,<sup>1</sup> with some configuration tweaks and an appropriately customized kernel.</p>

<p>The current version of Debian is also 8, and a major difference between it and previous versions (Debian has been around for several decades) is that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init"" rel=""nofollow"">init system</a>, formerly a spin on the venerable SysV init (which is older than Debian itself) was replaced with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"" rel=""nofollow"">systemd</a>.  GNU/Linux, like other unix derived operating systems such as Mac OS X, relies on an init system of one form or another.  Systemd is a fairly new one first adopted by Fedora a number of years ago, and since then it has been gradually picked up by other distros (winning favor over Canonical/Ubuntu's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstart"" rel=""nofollow"">upstart</a>).</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem is that there doesn't appear to be any such directory </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inittab wasn't a directory, it was a file.  Part of what it did was determine the default runlevel, which corresponds to the ""X"" in <code>/etc/rcX.d</code>.  Systemd does not use runlevels, the equivalent would be <em>targets</em> (primarily, ""graphical"" or plain ""multi-user"").</p>

<p>Fortunately, Debian has left in some backward compatible functionality and the <code>rcX.d</code> directories are still there and the stuff in them is still run.  Running something from them was never really as simple as just placing a script there -- possibly you are paraphrasing -- but in any case, you can use them exactly the same way as before (if ""they"" say it worked, it still should).  The runlevel you want to use is probably 2, or possibly 3.  However, there is no harm in doing whatever it is you are supposed to do with the script for levels 2, 3, 4, and 5.  Only one of them is actually used, so it is common practice to target those 4 (hence if you look, they are almost identical).</p>

<p>Another possibility, as dastaan points out, is to simply invoke the script from <code>rc.local</code>, which also still works.  Make sure you use the full path and fork it by placing an <code>&amp;</code> after that.</p>

<p>BTW, I don't think systemd is any harder to learn than SysV, and although there is much griping from people having to learn new things ""when the old one was fine"", if you haven't learned much of either one yet, you might as well start with systemd and ignore SysV, because SysV is pretty much dead, at least in the GNU/Linux world.</p>

<p>I do not know for sure if it is specific to Python 3.  But I do know that he was using python to test it out.</p>

<p>When you get to the point of compiling OpenCV from the source code, I would suggest using the cmake-gui</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install cmake-gui
</code></pre>

<p>The gui will allow you to see and enable/disable - graphically - all of the modules associated with OpenCV.  </p>

<p>When configuring on the RPi, make sure you uncheck any references to <code>cuda</code>.  This is the only REQUIRED step for you to take to get the library compiled.  But there are lots of other things you can add on. </p>

<p>NOTE: when you run <code>make</code> It will take FOREVER on your PI.  I would suggest running:</p>

<p><code>sudo make -j3</code>   </p>

<p>So that you run the compilation using 3 cores instead of 1.  This will cut down the compilation from about 3-4 hours down to around 1-2.</p>

<li>Is there any way to mount the new MicroSD card onto my original Pi via USB adapter and then clone form itself onto the mounted MicroSD via adapter? rpi-clone is out thought <em>as that also does not support NOOBS</em> (Man I hate I used NOOBS, I thought it was just the new supported method - not the 'locked on your same card forever' method)</li>

<li>Insert via USB SD reader the micro-SD into running Pi</li>
<li>Format the RASPBIAN partition on the micro-SD blank leaving just the FAT partition</li>
<li><code>DD</code> from my noobs RASPBIAN partition on my original SD to the micro-SD via adapter</li>
<li>Put the micro-sd into new B+ and hope for the best</li>
<li>If it does boot hopefully use raspi-config to expand the partition (as it will now no longer be NOOBS)</li>

<ol>
<li><p>Snappy Core is compiled for ARMv7, which means the software will better exploit the Pi 2's processor.

I haven't seen any explicit benchmarks.</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu have a less conservative policy with regard to versions and updating than Debian.  This means more recent versions of software will be available from their distro.</p></li>
<li><p>Snappy Core is set up to use a read-only filesystem.  I do not think this is a great idea and it is a shame that this is what Ubuntu and the Foundation have decided to promote for the pi, especially since <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/36383/5538"">Ubuntu have more normal ARMv7 distributions that could be run on it</a>.

<p>EDITED TO ADD</p>

<p>Some background</p>

<p>On recent Pis the audio jack output is provided by PWM channels 0 and 1.  PWM channel 0 is fed to GPIO40 which is connected to the (stereo) right channel, and PWM channel 1 is fed to GPIO45 which is connected to the (stereo) left channel.</p>

"Is there a lightweight webserver that will serve dynamic content?","12789","","<p>I'm building an image with a Nagios server. One of the problems of the raspberry pi is that the memory is quite small on the raspberry pi. So I'll be using a light weight interface based on php-apc instead of the standard one. </p>

<p>I was wondering what lightweight webserver is recommended to use? </p>

<p>I was considering a minimum webserver that can do php and provide SSL. I was thinking of Apache2 or Nginx. Although I think Apache will still outperform Nginx since the content is dynamic.</p>
","<p>The real question here is ""Do you need all the features that Apache provides?"" (or more importantly, ""Are you willing to use up memory for these features?"") -- You can custom-compile a <strong><em>VERY</em></strong> stripped-down Apache + mod_perl or mod_php to run your Nagios web interface (or an Über-Stripped apache that just runs the perl CGIs), but even in a minimalist form Apache will probably take more memory than nginx to do the same job - It just wasn't built to be small.</p>

<p>To be 100% sure you may want to do a bake-off (compile both nginx and Apache and see which eats less RAM), but my experience on ""normal"" servers tells me that nginx is probably the better choice for a low-memory configuration: You give up some of the flexibility of Apache, but if you didn't need that anyway (and most sites <em>don't</em>) you'll never notice the difference.</p>

<hr>

<p>Performance (time) wise I doubt you'll be limited by your web server -- All the contrived benchmarks aside, if you're doing enough volume where the performance of the server engine handing out the pages is that critical you're probably going to be baking your Raspberry Pi (and really, how many people are going to be looking at your monitoring data at once? :-).<br>

<p>Alternatively, I'd be happy to just create another partition on the SD Card for dumping files into. </p>

<p>The end goal is to set it up as a headless, wifi-access point, running ssh &amp; gphoto2 for capturing and downloading images from a canon dslr for timelapses.</p>

"Can Raspberry Pi reliably bit bang a 9600 baud serial and is there example code?","12670","","<p>I am wondering how feasible it is to use bitbanging to drive a 9600 baud serial via the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Obviously, Linux is not a terribly good platform for bitbanging, as there is a large number of drivers and other interrupts which may block the CPU for extended periods of time (1-10ms). However, the situation has gotten a lot better recently, and some pre-emption is now regularily enabled in kernels. I also suspect a real-time patched kernel can easily be used on the Raspberry Pi, and the connected hardware and drivers can be selected carefully.</p>

<p>My standard for reliability is that it should stay within normal 9600 baud serial tolerances most of the time. I am currently unsure how many errors are tolerable in practice, but there are retransmissions and acknowledgements in the protocol, so it is atleast somewhat tolerant.</p>

<p>So, my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can userland software reliably bit-bang 9600 baud speed?</li>
<li>Does this need a real-time patched kernel?</li>
<li>How many errors should I expect in general?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, is there any example code doing serial via GPIO bit banging? I know of Arduino SoftSerial, but that's about it.</p>

<p>Just in case, to limit the question: this is not a standard serial interface and the UART of Raspberry Pi is already used for another serial link. I do not wish for answers that suggest external hardware (such as Gertboard or Arduino) nor answers that depend on the UART.</p>
","<p><strong>I finally solved this, but in a pretty unorthodox way.</strong> I abandoned bit-banging as too unreliable and tried to find other solutions which would allow me to the same thing without adding more hardware. I was considering writing a kernel driver, which would trigger an interrupt on GPIO and then reconfigure the pin to be SPI and use SPI to read an entire data byte - but then I got a better idea.</p>

<p>I use SPI to sample the lines at 20x the baud rate. I ignore the SCLK and SS pins entirely, connect the RX line to MISO and TX line to MOSI. This gives me a (1-bit) oscilloscope-like view in to the RX line and clearly see the bits being transmitted in the serial line:</p>

<pre><code>00 00 00 00 00 00 
00 00 00 00 01 FF 
FF FF FF FF 00 00 
01 FF FF FF FF FF 
FF FF E0 00 00 00 
00 00 07 FF FF FF 
FF FF 
</code></pre>

<p>From this, it is a simple matter of coding to figure out the correct positions from which to sample the actual data bits. The sending side is equally trivial, I just need to convert every byte in to a long stream of bits with the start bit and stop bit included.</p>

<p>The reason this works better than bit-banging is that SPI has its own clock that does not freeze with the kernel and the SPI send and receive lines have a 16-byte FIFO for transfer which are also independent from kernel freezes. For 9600 baud, I am using a 250kHz SPI clock and that means that I can sleep for even a millisecond between filling and draining the FIFOs without any transmission errors. However, to err on the safe side, I am using 300 µs sleeps. I briefly tested on how far I could push this and atleast a 2MHz SPI clock was still usable so this solution scales to higher baud rates as well.</p>

<p>The one ugly part of this solution is that the kernel SPI driver does not support such a streaming bit transfer. This means I can not do this by writing my own kernel module using the kernel SPI driver, and I also can not do it by using /dev/sdidev0.0 from the user land. However, on the Raspberry Pi, the SPI and other peripherals are accessible directly from userland by mmap():n /dev/mem, bypassing the kernel control entirely. I am not terribly happy with this, but it works perfectly and it gives the added benefit that segmentation faults in the userland can not crash the kernel (unless messing with the other peripherals by accident). As for CPU use, 300 µs sleeps seem to give me about 7% CPU use constantly, but my code is very unoptimal. Increasing the sleep duration obviously lowers the CPU usage directly.</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot to mention, I used the nice <a href=""http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835/"">bcm2835</a> library to control the SPI from userland, extending it where necessary.</p>

<p>So, to summarize: <strong>I can reliably transmit and receive on a 9600 baud serial link entirely from userland by directly using the SPI chip via /dev/mem at 250kHz on the Raspberry Pi.</strong></p>

"How do I change the default OS to start with NOOBS Dual Boot headless?","12627","","<p>I installed two operating systems on my raspberry pi using NOOBS.
In my configuration the pi works headless, that means I won't be able to chage the os to start at runtime since I have no monitor and keyboard attached.</p>

<p>How can I change the OS to which the pi boots?</p>
","<p>For doing so, login to your raspberry py with putty or another SSH client.</p>

<p>Now you have to change one value in the noobs.conf. To be able to access this config file you have to do some stepps:</p>

<h3>Make directory to mount</h3>

<pre><code>mkdir /tmp/noobs
</code></pre>

<h3>mount noobs partition</h3>

<pre><code>sudo mount  /dev/mmcblk0p3 tmp/noobs
</code></pre>

<h3>look which os is on which partition</h3>

<pre><code>cat /tmp/noobs/installed_os.json
</code></pre>

<p>This part is interesting:</p>

<pre><code>""name"" : ""RISC OS"",
""partitions"" : [
  ""/dev/mmcblk0p5"",
  ""/dev/mmcblk0p6""
],
...
</code></pre>

<p>the mmcblk0p <strong>5</strong> is important</p>

<h3>edit the noobs.conf with e.g. nano and change the value <code>default_partition_to_boot</code>to the partition number</h3>

<pre><code>sudo nano noobs.conf

[General]
default_partition_to_boot=5
display_mode=0
keyboard_layout=us
language=en
</code></pre>

<h3>Now finally perform a reboot to chage to the other os</h3>

<pre><code>sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>If you want, you can make a shell script which changes the value and performs a reboot. That would make it easier, if you want to do this often.</p>

"Problems with installing Node.js NPM package","12609","","<p>I have a Raspberry Pi Model B+, and currently I have been working with web development.

<p>How can I fix this problem?</p>
","<p>I have seen this before on the Pi, where packages that are compiled by gyp refuse to compile or install. One method of getting around this problem is to install a precompiled binary. </p>

<p>To do this start by making sure that your Pi is up to date by entering the following in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>next download node (this will download the latest stable package):</p>

<pre><code>wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb
</code></pre>

<p>then install the package:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb
</code></pre>

<p>check the installation is working (the following command will return the version number of node):</p>

<pre><code>node -v
</code></pre>

<p>you may also want to check the npm version as well:</p>

<pre><code>npm -v

"Can I use the composite video connecor to send video INTO the Raspberry PI?","12571","","<p>I am looking to convert video from an analogue surveillance camera (w.

<p>If not, can anyone recommend a board or hack to achieve the same thing?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is for an existing environment, so changing the cameras is not an option.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The intention is to have video coming into this device from the analogue cameras, then back out of the device and into a DVR so the device would be used as a sort of proxy.</p>

<p>Appreciate your time.</p>
","<p>sorry, you cannot use composite video connector for video input, and using analog camera also seems very problematic. I'd recommend to get a cheap web-camera, 1280x720 should be available for less than $15 at any shop, connect it to the USB connector and enjoy!</p>

"Automatically accepting Bluetooth connections on a Pi 3","12557","","<p>I'm looking to develop a platform for my car which automatically connects any device which attempts to connect to the Pi via bluetooth. Currently it requires a pairing accept by the Pi but in this case there will be no screen so it will need to do it automatically. How can I accomplish this? </p>
","<p>So currently you state that you can connect to the Pi just fine, but require a monitor for the pairing process.</p>

<p>Note: accepting any connection is an incredibly insecure idea, and if you are only using a limited set of devices, setting them up as trusted devices would make a lot more sense as it would limit connection to your Mac addresses but wold not allow for new devices to be added without a monitor </p>

<p>But anyway, the commands that you will need to run to accept all connections being made to the Pi, to make it discoverable and to set a predictable pin are listed below:</p>

<p>Note: you may need to change the zero in <code>hci0</code>  to your devices Bluetooth number.</p>

<pre><code>hciconfig hci0 up
hciconfig hci0 sspmode 1
hciconfig hci0 piscan
sudo bluetooth-agent 1234
</code></pre>

<p>Now after running these commands and seeing if they work as expected we can move on to setting them up to start on the boot of your Pi.</p>

<ol>
<li>We start by creating a bash file by running the command <code>sudo nano mohammadIsAmazing.sh</code> </li>
<li><p>We now enter the following into that file:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
sleep 20
hciconfig hci0 up
hciconfig hci0 sspmode 1
hciconfig hci0 piscan
sudo bluetooth-agent 1234
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now we save and close our file using the <code>control key and x</code></p></li>
<li><p>We open up the file <code>/etc/rc.local</code> using the following command: </p>

"Enable monitoring mode for RTL8188CUS via USB on Raspbian","12538","","<p>I am trying to enable monitoring mode for a USB wifi dongle with the RTL8188CUS chipset on a raspberry pi model b+ (or any raspberry pi for that matter).</p>

<pre><code>$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0bda:8176 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8188CUS 802.11n WLAN Adapter
$ sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
Error for wireless request ""Set Mode"" (8B06) :
    SET failed on device wlan0 ; Invalid argument.
</code></pre>

<p>According to <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/369"">github/raspberrypi/linux/issues/369</a>, you need to enable the rtlwifi/rtl8192cu kernel module that is included with the kernel distribution but not compiled.  This requires minor modifications to some files as diff'ed below in 'STEP 2'. </p>

<p>The USB issue mentioned in that thread has been resolved as of 4.1.6+, so the rtlwifi driver should work.</p>

<p>Steps to recreate on a fresh raspberry pi (model B+)...</p>

<p><strong>STEP 0: Update existing modules and kernel to latest</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo rpi-update
$ uname -a
Linux raspberrypi 4.1.7+ #815 PREEMPT Thu Sep 17 17:59:24 BST 2015 armv6l GNU/Linux
</code></pre>

<p><strong>STEP 1:  Get the raspbian kernel source and add missing dependencies</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux
$ sudo apt-get install bc lshw
</code></pre>

<p><strong>STEP 2:  Enable the rtlwifi (kernel) drivers for RTL8188CUS (RTL8192)</strong></p>

<pre><code>edit linux/drivers/net/wireless/Kconfig
-#source ""drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi/Kconfig""
-source ""drivers/net/wireless/rtl8192cu/Kconfig""
+source ""drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi/Kconfig""

edit linux/drivers/net/wireless/Makefile
-#obj-$(CONFIG_RTLWIFI)         += rtlwifi/
+obj-$(CONFIG_RTLWIFI)          += rtlwifi/
</code></pre>

<p><strong>STEP 3: Compile and install kernel (took many hours)</strong></p>

<p>Summarized from <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md"">kernel building documentation</a> .</p>

<pre><code>$ cd linux
$ KERNEL=kernel
$ make bcmrpi_defconfig

$ make zImage modules dtbs
$ sudo make modules_install
$ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb /boot/
$ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays/
$ sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays/
$ sudo scripts/mkknlimg arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/$KERNEL.img
</code></pre>

<p><strong>STEP 4: Reboot</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p><strong>STEP 5: Check that the rtlwifi/rtl8192cu module is loaded</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ lsmod | fgrep rtl8192cu

<p><strong>STEP 6: Try to activate monitoring mode</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
Error for wireless request ""Set Mode"" (8B06) :
    SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not supported.
</code></pre>

<p>What did i miss?<br>
Issue 369 seems to indicate that it can work with the rtlwifi driver?</p>
","<p>Turns out the steps to recompile and load the rtlwifi module are correct.  The problem is iwconfig not working to enable/determine monitoring mode in this situation.</p>

<p>Instead, I used <a href=""https://sandilands.info/sgordon/capturing-wifi-in-monitor-mode-with-iw"" rel=""nofollow"">iw as outlined by Steven Gordon</a> and it worked.  </p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<p><strong>STEP 6b: List the physical network interfaces available</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ iw dev
</code></pre>

<p><strong>STEP 7: Determine if the physical interface supports monitoring mode</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ iw phy phy0 info
... lots of stuff ...
Supported interface modes:
     * IBSS
     * managed
     * AP
     * AP/VLAN
     * monitor
     * mesh point
     * P2P-client
     * P2P-GO
... lots more stuff ...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>STEP 8: Add a monitoring interface to that physical card</strong></p>

<p>You need to explicitly add a 'monitoring' interface for the hardware you have.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo iw phy phy0 interface add mon0 type monitor
</code></pre>

<p><strong>STEP 8: Start monitoring</strong></p>

<p>In my case, I'm using tshark to facilitate monitoring, displaying a few useful fields rather than a lot of noise.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install tshark
$ sudo tshark -i mon0 -f 'broadcast' -T fields -e frame.time_epoch -e wlan.sa -e radiotap.dbm_antsignal -e wlan.fc.type -e wlan.fc.subtype

<p>BACKGROUND I have a Pi, which is mainly used headless via <code>ssh</code> or <code>VNC</code>. I also run <code>netatalk</code> on the Pi so I can mount the <code>home</code> directory in <code>Finder</code> (or <a href=""http://binnie.id.au/QuollEyeTree.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""QuollEyeTree"">QuollEyeTree</a>). I want to run the backup on my Mac.</p>

<pre><code>/proc/*
/sys/*
/dev/*
/boot/*
/tmp/*
/run/*
/mnt/*
</code></pre>

<p>and run my <code>rsync</code> with the following script</p>

# script to synchronise Pi files to backup
rsync -av --delete-during --exclude-from=bin/rsync-exclude.txt pi@MYPINAME.local:/ /Volumes/Data/PiBackup
</code></pre>

<p>I encountered a number of issues, which are my actual questions (if anyone can help):-</p>

<ol>
<li><p>@goldilocks used <code>rsync -aEv ...</code> I tried this and got</p>

<p><code>rsync: on remote machine: --extended-attributes: unknown option</code>
This confused me; <code>man rsync</code> listed <code>E</code>. I know extended attributes are not often used on Linux, but OS X makes extensive use of them, and if I list files on the Pi home directory (mounted on my Mac) I can see them, and list values.</p></li>
<li><p>Initially I used <code>--exclude-from=~/bin/rsync-exclude.txt</code>, but <code>rsync</code> could not find it. I discovered that <code>scp</code> assumes all paths are relative to the home directory, and apparently so does <code>rsync</code>; although this does not seem to be documented.</p></li>
<li><p>The script will not delete files from the backup when deleted on the Pi.</p>

<p><code>IO error encountered -- skipping file deletion</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>I assume this is related to file permissions. The backup files are all owned by my Mac user.
I wonder what would happen if/when I try to restore the system files.</p>
","<p>I am not sure why people are suddenly answering this question more than a year after it was asked.</p>

<p>For the record, I decided that rsync to Mac OS X wasn't going to work (due to different <code>rsync</code> options, but more importantly as with different users on OS X the permissions were not retained). </p>

<p>I now use the procedure outlined in <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/28087/8697"">https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/28087/8697</a> - this backs up my Pi to an external HDD.</p>

"record and stream video from camera simultaneously","12477","","<p>I am recording video from Pi using Camera Module with picamera:</p>

        camera.wait_recording(5)
    camera.stop_recording()
</code></pre>

<p>I have seperately used a combination of <code>raspivid</code> and <code>gstreamer</code> to stream video from pi without any delay. Is there a way to store and stream footage using python <em>simultaneously</em>?</p>

<p>My thinking is there must be a way to use camera as input and create two output sources: a 720p video for storage and a downscaled 240p video for streaming using gstreamer...?</p>
","<p>The <code>tee</code> command reads from standard input and copies to any number of files plus standard output by default, see <code>man tee</code> for more details.  This means you can ask tee to create a file from input and then pipe the output to something else.</p>

<p>The addition of an extra pipe does <em>in theory</em> add a bit of inefficiency.  As to whether this is significant or not you will have to judge for yourself using your own streaming method.  My current method is not satisfactory at full resolution.  It's not a huge interest right now but when it is I will try to find something better (e.g. supposedly gstreamer works better than clvc).</p>

<p>However, worth noting that the file saved locally on the pi at the same time is perfect quality, so the activity does not interfere with raspivid.  Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>raspivid -o - -t 0 | tee test_video.h264 |
cvlc -v stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ts,dest=:8080' :demux=h264
</code></pre>

<p>I broke this into two lines for readability; you can hit return after <code>|</code> (pipe) and finish the command just as you can break a line with <code>\</code>.  You can replace the <code>cvlc</code> with whatever you want.  Again, although the stream was of poor quality, <code>test_video.h264</code> came out perfect.</p>

<p>If I lower the resolution to 640x360 this arrangement is fine, with a second or two of latency which is what I normally get.  I do not think the <code>tee</code> or the second pipe makes any difference to the quality of the stream; these are capable of much higher throughput than necessary here and do not require much in the way of system resources.</p>

<p>The CPU ran at 35-45%, which is the same as it does when streaming video sans <code>tee</code>.</p>

"Install Arch Linux from osx","12416","","<p>I have recently downloaded archlinux, but as embarrassing as it is I simply don't think I am installing it correctly. When I do, my version of the install and hook it up to the Raspberry Pi, the screen remains black.</p>

<p>But im not on linux. Any Help/link to instructions would be Great!</p>
","<p>I just ran into this issue myself. I found two ways to create the SD card using the .tar.gz images provided by ArchLinuxARM, provided you have a USB SD card reader.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Raspberry Pi + USB card reader + 1 additional SD card</h2>

<p>This method requires an additional SD card and a USB card reader. It uses Linux on your Raspberry Pi to build an new SD card that can boot into ArchLinux.</p>

<ol>
<li>Connect an external USB card reader to Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>Plug the SD card that you want to install ArchLinux onto into the external USB card reader.</li>
<li>Boot your Raspberry Pi using Raspbian, as Raspbian has an image you can write to an SD card from OSX or Windows.</li>
<li><p>Install bsdtar using: <code>sudo apt-get install bsdtar</code></p></li>
<li><p>Follow the <a href=""http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi"">ArchLinuxARM instructions for Raspberry Pi</a>. Make sure you do everything as the root user. To become root on Raspbian, run <code>sudo -s</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Method 2: VMWare + USB card reader</h2>

<p>This method does not require an additional USB card, but it does require you to have installed Linux on a VMWare.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start Linux on VMWare</li>
<li>Connect an external USB card reader to the computer running VMWare. VMWare will ask you if you want to connect it to your Linux instance, which is what you want.</li>
<li>Follow the <a href=""http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi"">ArchLinuxARM instructions for Raspberry Pi</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I was able to build an SD card running ArchLinux on my Mac running VMWare Fusion. I imagine this also works with <a href=""https://www.virtualbox.org/"">Virtual Box</a> though I did not try. I imagine it works on Windows but, again, I did not try.</p>

<p>You should also know that <a href=""http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1035825"">VMWare is not able to access the Mac's built in SD card reader</a>, hence the need for a USB card reader. Perhaps on Windows VMWare can access the built-in card reader, making the external USB card reader unnecessary.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>The above two methods did work, but it took several tries for me to get it to work. Here are some of the issues I ran into:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had an intermittent failure while using bsdtar to extract image. Using <code>journalctl -kf</code> I was able to see a reset occurring in the USB system. I was able to git rid of this reset by connecting my unpowered USB card reader to a USB hub, rather that connecting it directly to my Raspberry Pi (method 1) or Mac (method 2).</li>
<li>Using method 2, I kept getting an error about pathnames not being able to be converted from UTF-8 to the current locale. I then realized my current locale was not set to UTF-8, so I fixed this issue by running <code>localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8</code> and then logging out and back into Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p>When booting the Raspberry Pi into Arch, I highly recommend using a USB serial cable, like the <a href=""https://www.adafruit.com/product/954"">USB to TTL Serial Cable from Adafruit</a> or any FTDI based USB to serial cable. This will allow you to see the entire boot process of the Raspberry Pi, which is a key debugging tool when trying to use a new OS on Raspberry Pi.</p>

"Raspberry Pi fails to turn on","12337","","<p>I have a problem with my Raspberry Pi. When I plug in the power, the device fails to power on. The <code>POWER</code> LED turns on, but nothing else happens. My display still says No signal, the <code>OK</code> LED does not turn on or blink and network LEDs stay unlit even though the cable is inserted.</p>

<p>Basically, the symptoms are the same as if I tried to turn the Raspberry Pi on without an SD card inserted. I last used a Raspberry Pi a week or so ago and it worked fine. I've checked if the SD card has maybe died and it is working fine on my computer. I've tried reflashing it with a fresh Arch image but still nothing.</p>

<p>The power supply and the USB cable are almost certainly adequate (5.0V with my multimeter between TP1 and TP2 and I've never had any problems even when running intensive computation and having external USB devices attached)</p>

<p>The funny thing is... if I hold the PCB and the SD card together with two fingers, the Raspberry Pi DOES turn on, but the boot process freezes (no kernel panic or anything, just hang) when I release it.</p>

<p>What could be the cause of this problem? Is it more likely that the SD card is indeed faulty or is there a problem in the Raspberry Pi itself?</p>
","<p>It sounds like it could potentially be one of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A problem in the SD card meaning that when booting, it struggles to access the boot partition correctly (which would explain why when you boot and let go, it freezes again)</p></li>
<li><p>A problem with the physical SD card slot in the Pi - one of the contacts could be broken or faulty meaning that when you squeeze it it makes the contact again and works ok.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The easiest thing to do would be to try another SD card, and then perhaps potentially another Pi if you can get your hands on one. Until that, it's quite difficult to say which one of those issues it likely is.</p>

now when my program runs it causes an internal error, but that is not the big deal.
My problem is I can't login to the system anymore, because it all stops before the login prompt.</p>

<p>How can i skip that?</p>
","<p>One way of solving this is editing your cmdline.txt to avoid starting any of your services:</p>

<p>Insert your SD card into another PC. On your SD boot partition, edit the file cmdline.txt and append (in the same line): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>init=/bin/bash</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Save and insert again your sd card into your raspberry pi. When you power it, you will be logged as root, without starting any of your services. What we have done is skipping the execution of the init program which manages to start all the services.</p>

<p>Once you have disabled java, shutdown your raspberry pi by using:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>poweroff -f</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(You can't use shutdown because you don't have any init program running and shutdown will try to tell init to change the current runlevel to zero)</p>

<p>And finally, edit again your cmdline.txt file on another pc and restore it has before so you can start raspbian normally.</p>

","<p><code>I²C</code> protocol is very simple. It does not really define data structures that are sent over the wire. The frame consist of a slave address (with direction bit indicating if master wants to read or write) and (in case of writing) some bytes of data.

<p>This first byte is often used as a slave register address or command number but it doesn't have to. There may or may not be additional bytes after the first one. The higher level protocol defining what each byte means is device specific. </p>

<p>This may explain why there are two separate arguments - first one (<code>cmd</code>) is mandatory and second one (<code>vals</code>) is optional.

"Using other camera modules to build custom webcams","12246","","<p>I have three old iPhones (iPhone 3GS, iPhone 3G and an iPhone 4) that I recovered from family members that were going to throw away. I had the 3GS so out of curiosity I disassembled it and recovered a camera module with the code cap37-0501-00, which is shown <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00KQUX2S6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Here is a photo: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nCEjY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> Would it be possible to buy the necessary connectors or computer hardware necessary to create my own camera module? I noticed that it has a small adapter shown here: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9rq6W.jpg"" alt=""small adapter""> </p>

<p>that looks like it just snaps together with a cable like this: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YgOpj.jpg"" alt=""cable""></p>

<p>I have done a good amount of C coding so I'm not too worried about having to custom write drivers, but I want to build a 3d modeling system using multiple pis and multiple camera modules so I was just wondering if I could build my own as a learning exercise and if so, where could I further look into assembling a working camera module... I assume that given that iOS is proprietary this task may prove to be impossible but I want to reduce costs as much as possible and if I could somehow use these 3 extra cameras that are being unused, that would be really cool.</p>

<p>Currently I have a <a href=""http://www.uugear.com/product/mini-150-degree-2-1mm-wide-angle-webcam-for-raspberry-pi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">20MP interpolated camera module</a> from UUGear, which is absolutely phenomenal, and may just end up getting those, but I don't mind doing the extra work necessary to build my own modules. The quality of the iPhone cameras has also been very high so that is what prompted me to try and recover the phones to build custom Pi cameras.</p>
","<p>I'm afraid this is most likely impractical. My (crude and thoroughly incomplete) understanding is that the Pi's camera module (which uses an OmniVision OV5647 sensor) is very closely tied to the camera firmware on the GPU. The camera's own ISP is largely ignored and the GPU itself performs the majority of post-processing (de-mosaic, AWB, AGC, etc). In <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=581006#p581006"">this forum post</a> jbeale (who knows a good deal more about these things than I do) goes into some of the complexities one would face in trying to make an interface-compatible camera:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>plugwash wrote:What is stopping someone making an interface-compatible clone of the chip?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Well... google for a preliminary datasheet for the R-Pi camera sensor ""ov5647_full.pdf"" (confidential, but nevertheless leaked online) and note the hundreds of control registers, many described in a few words only. Even the R-Pi foundation who have a current data sheet under NDA report it does not describe the chip well enough to use it, much less re-create it. The R-Pi implementation relies on specific register parameter sets they got direct from OmniVision. I assume the incomplete documentation is a deliberate strategy to prevent the very thing you suggest (as well as the fact that writing good accurate complete documentation takes a lot of time).</p>
  
  <p>I presume you could reverse engineer a chip that worked in one specific application based on specific settings, but the device is so configurable, it would not be a general-purpose replacement, hence not marketable enough to make it worth the considerable effort. At least, that is my guess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Might be worth reading the rest of that thread as well; it's about the cheap knock-offs of the official Pi camera module. What's interesting to note is that every single one uses the same sensor and just varies the PCB layout and/or lenses which hints that doing anything else is simply not economic (even assuming it's practical), so whilst it might make an academically interesting exercise (again, assuming it's practical) it would almost certainly be cheaper to just buy some camera modules given the equipment you'd need to perform the reverse engineering.</p>

<p>To give some idea of the equipment and complexities involved, here's a couple more forum posts with detail of reverse engineering work done on the Pi's own camera module:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=377024#p377024"">Frame synchronization</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=374258#p374258"">Low level interfacing to OV5647</a></li>

"Using one Raspi to control long (>100ft) of 5V LED strip","12090","","<p>I am using the below LED strip for accent lighting</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/23qz3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>5M WS2801 Blcak PCB 32LED 5050 RGB Digital LED Strip Individually Addressable 5V</li>
<li>item: nonwaterproof black pcb ws2801 led strips</li>
<li>Model: 5050RGB WS2801</li>
<li>Working voltage: DC5V</li>
<li>LED Type:SMD5050 RGB</li>
<li>Led Qty: 32 led per meter</li>
<li>Wave length(NM):R-650mcd, G-520mcd,B-460mcd</li>
<li>Power(W/M):9W/M</li>
<li>IC: each led controlled by one WS2801 ic chip</li>
<li>Scale:256</li>
<li>View angle:120 degree</li>
<li>Life span:no less than 50000hrs</li>
<li>Packaging:5M/reel in antistatic bag</li>
<li>NONWaterproof</li>
</ul>

<p>I need to control the light such that all 100+ft are working together (ie. the same color or color transitions continuous). Ideally, I would connect them to one power source, but that will lead to voltage drop. I could try to connect them in parallel, but eventually there will be too many amps. I could connect a power supply for each 5m, and then network all the raspis to give the appearance of all strips working together, but that requires power supplies for the raspis, and I don't want to go around the house and hide them all.</p>

<p>Could someone give a very beginners explanation of how I can both power that many LEDs <strong>and</strong> control them from a single raspi.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I wanted to know how I would have to connect them, for example if a 5v 2A adapter to a 10m strip is failing can I just use a second 5V 2A adapter and split the strip into 2x5m strips, then connect the first adapter to the first 5m strip and the second adapter to the second 5m adapter (see below)?</p>

<ul>
<li>Adapter/Raspi --> [10m strip] FAILS</li>
<li>Adapter/Raspi --> [5m strip] --> Adapter --> [5m strip] SUCCEEDS?</li>
</ul>

<p>What about the <code>DI</code> and <code>CI</code> connections? Can I just connect the <code>DI/CI</code> out of the first strip to the <code>DI/CI</code> in of the second strip and then hope that the signals sent from the raspi to the first strip will magically be transferred to the second strip? I can't help but shake the feeling that it's not that simple since power supply is so finicky (ie. voltage drop, wire thickness, series v parallel...) I get the feeling I am jerry rigging power supplies in here all willy nilly.</p>
","<p>The <strong>WS2801</strong> is a 3 channel constant current LED driver. You need 1 of these for every LED. THere are other RGB drivers but the WS2801 are the easiest and most flexible to work with.</p>

<p>The power source <strong>MUST</strong> be separate to the Pi. But that is easy as connecting a power pack to the Vcc and GND on the LED strip.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UKosV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Controlling</strong></p>

<p>The problem with these <a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2801.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WS2801</a> LED is that the Input Output signal level is dependant on the Input voltage. (0.8 * Vcc) So to get it to work directly on the Raspberry Pi GPIO you can only supply 4.1volts maximum, which gives you a 3.2Volt Data level that is safe for the Pi. <em>But some people say even if the LEDs run at 5Volt it still works- it might be a different version of the chip.</em></p>

<p>The spec sheet you can supply from 3.3 to 5.5volts. The WS2801 actually uses a 2 Wire protocol</p>

<ol>
<li>CKI - Data clock input at 25Mhz</li>
<li>SDI - Serial gray scale data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Luckily you don't have to write any code as there is something called <a href=""https://github.com/scottjgibson/PixelPi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PixelPi</a> that already knows how to talk to these guys.</p>

<p><strong>Powering</strong></p>

<p>Long pieces of LED strips need allot more power than you might think.</p>

<ul>
<li>After 2~4 metres you can cut the Vcc Line on the LED strip and connect a new power adapter. Leave the GND, DO, DI as is. This way you can power a long LED strip in sections.</li>
<li>Another way is to use a powerful regulated power supply. Like a computer power supply. Then connect the start of the LED power, and run copper cable next to the LED strip and connect it every 3metres. You dont need to section up LED because power always uses the least resistive route, in this case your extra copper wire from the same power supply.</li>

"Bluetooth AutoConnect on reboot , car setup with scripts","12034","","<p>Alright guys I am having some issues. I have setup a bluetooth configuration (well setup is being generous, I ran a few lines of code as described here:
<a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Enhance-your-Raspberry-Pi-media-center-with-Blueto/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instructables.com/id/Enhance-your-Raspberry-Pi-media-center-with-Blueto/</a>). I am able to connect to my phone on each reboot by going to my iPhone setting and clicking connect to my known bluetooth connection points. I am also able to connect to my phone via bluetoothctl.</p>

<p>With bluetoothctl it connects but I havent found a way for it to automatically connect without having to manually type in connect AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF . Even if I could find a way 
I am guessing that I would be unable to run a shutdown script that is used for my car when ignition is turned off with a mausberrycircuit car switch. Info here:
<a href=""http://mausberrycircuits.com/pages/car-setup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mausberrycircuits.com/pages/car-setup</a></p>

<p>Would there be a way for that script to take precedence even over an open bluetoothctl?</p>

<p>The second way I have found to connect and ""works"" is</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo rfcomm connect 0 AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 1
</code></pre>

<p>attached at the end of /etc/rc.local file and it works in the sense that in the bluetooth settings of my phone it says connected but when I play music is still plays on the phone. I have to manually click the connected button for it to start playing over the raspberry pi output.</p>

<p>What is going to be a way for me to automatically (needing no input other than me turning the key to my ignition) connect the pi to my iPhone 6.</p>

<p>Additional information:
Running Raspbian Wheezy on BerryBoot.</p>

<p>Thank you for any input. I have learned a lot but I feel like there is a lot I am not understanding and still have to learn.</p>
","<p>I guess I was able to answer my own question. At the end of my </p>

<pre><code>/etc/rc.local
</code></pre>

<p>File I added the following line after of course I manually trusted my MAC address</p>

<pre><code>echo ""connect AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF \nquit"" | bluetoothctl
</code></pre>

<p>Which connects to my already paired and trusted device and exits bluetoothctl allowing for a shutdown script to be initiated at the proper times.</p>

<p>I thought it was necessary at first to use the following line but the previous one was the one that didn't cause any errors</p>

<pre><code>echo -e ""connect AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF \nquit"" | bluetoothctl 
</code></pre>

<p>I will be working on using a python script to catch a specific device and managing the rc.local file to possibly add more possible inputs but for now this will suffice for my desires and needs.</p>

<p>alternatively, continuing with the rfcomm command you can use</p>

<pre><code>sudo rfcomm connect 0 AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 1 &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>1 designates the channel, I typically keep this blank but I included it in case someone looking back needs to connect on a specific channel.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>While this isn't directly related to the question it is an option I would have opted for had it been available. This will allow the user to simply click connect to the bluetooth device and it automatically pairs. The following link allows for a completely automated install and allows for A2DP, AirPlay, and Aux cable input. You can still use the above to completely automate the connection upon boot, or choose to connect via AirPlay. Just follow the install on the README.md</p>

"Backup Raspberry Pi automatically, with incremental backups","12028","","<p>There are some different questions and answers on this subject. However, when searching I have been unable to find an answer that could be considered ""canonical"" or that gathers the various options in one place.</p>

<p>I would like to backup the contents of my Raspberry Pi to enable a complete restoration if needed, easily and reliably.</p>

<p>These features would be ideal:</p>

<ul>
<li>Backups kept on external location (USB stick, DAS, NAS, Network computer, etc)</li>
<li>Automatisation, either incremental or via scheduling</li>
<li>Version numbering of backups</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloning the SD card seems to be a popular solution, but according to this <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/5492/36351"">post by Goldilocks</a> this is not advisable because a clone contains files that are loaded only on runtime, etc.</p>

<p>So I'm assuming that a good solution uses something like <code>rsync</code> or perhaps more robustly, a utility that can handle the critera above.</p>

<p><strong>My particular situation:</strong>
I have a Raspberry Pi on a LAN where I can backup to a Mac OS X computer, a Synology DiskStation NAS or to a USB memory stick connected to the Raspberry. I would prefer not to use the latter.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://rsnapshot.org/"">Rsnapshot</a> fulfills those criteria:</p>

<li><p>Can be automated/scheduled.</p></li>
<li><p>Uses numbered incremental backups.</p></li>

"How to use matchbox-window-manager with web browser?","12024","","<p>I'm having trouble with running uzbl browser under matchbox-window-manager on a raspberry pi. I'm using it with a 22' lcd screen to display some info (temperatures, graphs, VPS server stats...).</p>

<p>What I actually did is:
Set up the raspberry pi to start X at startup (raspi-config). Created /home/pi/.xsession with the following contents:</p>

<pre><code>kiosk-browser &amp;
exec matchbox-window-manager -use_cursor no -use_titlebar no
</code></pre>

<p>kiosk-browser contents:</p>

<pre><code>#! /bin/bash

while true
do
    if [ $(pidof -x uzbl-core | wc -l | tr -s ""\n"") -eq 0 ]
    then
        uzbl -u http://localhost/ -n kiosk &amp;

    memFree=$(grep MemFree /proc/meminfo | awk '{print $2}')

<p>So you now see what I'm trying to achieve. I'm updating some divs contents and images using jQuery, and didn't find a better way not to freeze the pi after consuming all available RAM, as each browser I tested does this (after some significant ammount of time).</p>

<p>The problem I'm having with this setup is it sometimes doesn't reload the browser properly, but freezes instead. Sometimes with a black screen (as when the pi starts), sometimes it's white screen (uzbl loading html), and sometimes even sooner, before dismissing the old html contents.</p>

<p>So basically what I'm trying to ask is, is this setup ok? Is this how it's done, or am I missing something? :)</p>

<p>THANK YOU!</p>
","<p>Thank you all for helping me! I managed to probably solved this with just using lightdm (no other window manager).</p>

","<p>Unless you have a need for many concurrent users or processes writing to the database at the same time I would recommend sqlite. It is file based so you don't need a server running, and each project can use its own database file (unless they need to share data).

<p>At home I have external USB 3TB HDD. Also at home I have a wifi, but there is no strict computer place.</p>

<p>So my first goal was to be able to connect to my HDD via wifi. So options were NAS box, router with USB or old computer.</p>

<p>But at one forum, guys adviced me to use Raspberry PI, as a server.</p>

<p>So I'v researched a little bit and I'v got a plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Raspberry PI model B(A originally, because of 1 port and 10$)</li>
<li>USB HUB(4+ slots)</li>
<li>WIFI module.</li>
<li>DYNDNS to be able to connect from outer world.</li>
<li>External 3TB HDD.</li>
<li>Debian + FTP server</li>
<li>Other server software like web-server and DB. Might be some custom apps.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>So as model A has only single port, and model B only 2 with ethernet, I think it is far more better to buy a model a and a hub, so I will be able to use wifi adapter, my HDD and some other devices as well.</em></p>

<p>This should be kind of 24/7 system I guess.</p>

<p>Is it a good plan or there are some drawbacks?</p>
","<p>What you want is known as Network Attached Storage and is a common use for Raspberry Pi.  There are very good step by step instructions for setting up all the hardware at <a href=""http://elinux.org/R-Pi_NAS"">http://elinux.org/R-Pi_NAS</a>.  There are a couple things to keep in mind</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Raspberry Pi is relatively low power which is great because its cheap to run but not so great because if you try to stream HD video it probably won't be able to maintain high enough through put.  As long as all you're doing is backing up files your Raspberry Pi will be fine.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use some configuration of dyndns to access your NAS from outside your network then you should do some research into VPN.  If you just leave your NAS available to the outside world by port forwarding then anybody could access it and you will eventually have a security problem.  Setting up careful access control like they explain in the instructions I linked will ward off some security problems but you still should look into possibly using VPN.</p></li>
<li><p>Originally I said to not use a USB wifi dongle for performance purposes, but I have since learned that the B model's <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=11773"">ethernet port is run off of the Pi's built in USB hub</a>.  It would seem that wifi might not be as large a performance barrier as I originally mentioned though I would still suggest using wired ethernet for security.  Also, depending on the particulars of your setup (eg how far is the Raspberry Pi from the wireless router) wired ethernet would more than likely still have improved performance.</p></li>

The software in question would be written in Ruby. I assume that the end-user has physical access to the SD card and is smart enough to gain root access to the Pi.</p>

<p>As I see it, options may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encrypt part (or all) of the SD card</li>
<li>Obfuscate the Ruby code or compile it down to bytecode (JRuby or Rubinius)</li>
</ul>

<p>Encryption would be the best solution, but I can't think of a way to decrypt without asking the user for the key. Code obfuscation is definitely possible, but less secure in my mind.</p>

<p>Is it possible to encrypt a portion of the SD card without prompting the user for a key to decrypt it? Or is there a better way to make sure the code is only accessible on the desired device?</p>
","<p>Of course it's possible to decrypt encrypted file/containers/etc. without asking for a password. It's sufficient to store the (encrypted) password on the SD card and use it to decrypt your data. For example, an easy <code>openssl</code> demo could be:</p>

<pre><code>openssl enc -a -e -salt -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:abc123 -in /tmp/plaintext.txt -out /tmp/ciphertext.enc

openssl enc -d -a -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:abc123 -in /tmp/ciphertext.enc
</code></pre>

<p>The encryption would be performed while installing the software on the Pi, and the decryption would be performed at runtime, possibly in RAM. For example, the password could be a combination of some pseudorandom sequence number (known to you) and the specific Pi's serial number obtained from a <code>cat /proc/cpuinfo</code>. Then you have to find a suitably hidden location to store this pseudorandom number that is to all intents and purposes ""<em>the password</em>"" and thus the weak point of the whole encryption mechanism. For example a spare sector on the SD would be the typical choice, but you can even embed it into one of your executables.</p>

<p>In any case, your best option is to both encrypt and compile your software, to add different layers of obfuscation to your software.</p>

<p>Finally, if your software needs an internet connection, you can even make the Pi ask for the password every time. You'll still need to hide the password inside the connection, you will also have to use <code>https</code> and you'll have to protect against reply attacks, using the current time as <code>salt</code> for the encryption.</p>

<p>You have a lot of (cheap) options to make you software secure. But you have to know that if your software hits some well defined popularity threshold, it will be cracked for sure, even if you invest substantial amounts of money in its protection.</p>

"How to restore the original iptables configuration?","11826","","<p>I use RaspBMC as OS which stores its ""persistent"" iptables configuration in <code>/etc/network/if-up.d/secure-rmc</code> and I presume it's applied when the eth link goes up (e.g. after boot).</p>

<p>If I futz with the rules in the console, how can I reload the ""persistent"" ones (and discard the futz'd rules)? </p>

<p>There's no 'service' per se for iptables, and trying to <code>service networking restart</code> doesn't seem to help. </p>

<p>I've already locked myself out twice trying variations of <code>ifconfig eth0 down; ifconfig eth0 up</code> (a reboot helps :-) )</p>
","<p>The <code>iptables</code> ""rules"" commands in <code>secure-rmc</code> are very simplistic:</p>

<pre><code>logger -t iptables ""Configuring ip tables for interface $IFACE""
if [ ""$IFACE"" != ""lo"" ]; then
    NETMASK=$(get_subnet $IFACE)
    iptables -A INPUT -s $NETMASK -i $IFACE -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -i $IFACE -j DROP
fi
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>get_subnet</code> is a function that extracts the subnet of interface <code>$IFACE</code> using <code>ifconfig</code>)</p>

<ul>
<li>Accept any traffic from the local network on <code>$IFACE</code>.</li>
<li>Ignore all other incoming traffic from <code>$IFACE</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest you to utilise <code>iptables-save</code> and <code>iptables-restore</code> when playing with firewall rules. Have a look at their manual pages for more details.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>iptables-save &gt; iptables-original.rules

"How to fix: mount error(22): Invalid argument?","11802","","<p>I used to <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8386/how-to-mount-time-capsule-from-raspberry-pi"">mount a Time Capsule share</a> and everything was working great. Recently, probably after a system update, <code>sudo mount -a</code> give the following error:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo mount -a
mount error(22): Invalid argument
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)
</code></pre>

<p>How can I fix the problem?</p>
","<p>The issue seems to be caused by a change in the <strong>default security mode of the Samba client</strong> installed on the RaspberryPi.  Apple Time Capsule  appears to only support the NTLM password hashing method and, apparently, this is no longer what the client provides (interestingly enough, the <code>mount.cifs</code> man page still states that NTLM is the default option though).</p>

<p>In order to force the client to set the security mode to what's required by Time Capsule, you need to explicitly set a relevant flag.  Your <code>/etc/fstab</code> entry might therefore look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>//192.168.1.1/Time-Capsule /mnt/TimeCapsule cifs credentials=[your_TimeCapsule_credentials_path],file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,rw,sec=ntlm   0   0
</code></pre>

<p>The most important bit is the <code>sec=ntlm</code> option and this is what should do the trick.  However, please bear in mind that for security reasons NTLM is no longer recommended by Microsoft who originally designed it.</p>

<p>And just to confirm I have had exactly the same problem with my Time Capsule since December 2013 when I ran an APT update that included <code>samba</code>, <code>samba-common</code> and <code>samba-common-bin</code> package changes.  All of them were what seemed like very minor updates though: from version 3.6.6-6+deb7u1 to 3.6.6-6+deb7u2.
Fred has asked about the <code>cifs-utils</code> version and in my case it is currently 2:5.5-1.  I'm not sure if this is relevant but this particular package did not get updated in that round of Samba changes.</p>

Miguel Grinberg's article <a href=""http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/video-streaming-with-flask"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> outlines how to achieve Raspberry Pi camera streaming to Flask, and provides several useful examples. A simple, complete (non-Pi camera) program is provided which shows the use of a generator function and a multi-part response type to achieve animated streaming:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
from flask import Flask, render_template, Response
from camera import Camera

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

def gen(camera):
    while True:
        frame = camera.get_frame()
        yield (b'--frame\r\n'
               b'Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n' + frame + b'\r\n')

@app.route('/video_feed')
def video_feed():
    return Response(gen(Camera()),
                    mimetype='multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)

<p>You can see that the <code>/video-feed</code> route returns a multipart response type object which is continually generated by the <code>gen(camera)</code> function. Without this approach I suspect a static image is all you'll ever see.

<p>Sure enough, my CPU is only running at 700MHz.</p>

<p>Why won't my Raspberry Pi overclock?</p>

<p>I'm running Occidentalis 0.2.</p>
","<p>There was a change in the firmware/kernel recently, that enabled kernel CPU frequency scaling. Now, you don't set static CPU frequency in config.txt, you set maximum frequency. If your system is on load, it will change CPU frequency to higher value (it is called <code>turbo mode</code>, you can see the <code>max</code> setting in your log line) but if your system is idle, it will lower the frequency to the minimal value (by default it's RaspberryPi default values - 700MHz for ARM, 250MHz for core, 400MHz for SDRAM). It will also lower voltage if you are using overvoltage settings. By default <code>ondemand</code> frequency governor is used.</p>

<p>You can change default values (used when idle) with <code>arm_freq_min</code>, <code>gpu_freq_min</code>, <code>core_freq_min</code>, <code>sdram_freq_min</code> and  <code>over_voltage_min</code> options in <code>config.txt</code>. You can also disable this behaviour and return to what it was working before this change was introduced to firmware with <code>force_turbo=1</code> in your config.txt file. This way CPU frequency scaling will be disabled.</p>

<p>There are also two more changes when <code>force_turbo=0</code> (which is default default):</p>

<ul>
<li>h264/v3d/isp freqencies are not scaled so if you want to overclock
them, you also need <code>force_turbo=1</code> </li>
<li>overvoltage max value is 6 (1.35V), instead of 8</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that you can change some of the frequency configuration (at least for ARM) dynamically using <code>sysfs</code>. Just take a look at:</p>

<p>To quote <a href=""http://megakemp.com/2013/02/26/adventures-in-overclocking-a-raspberry-pi/"">this blog post on overclocking the Pi:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ondemand governor used in the Raspberry Pi will increase the CPU speed to the maximum configured value whenever it finds it to be busy more than 95% of the time. That sounds fair enough for most cases, but if you’d like that extra speed bump even when the system is performing somewhat lighter tasks, you’ll have to lower the load threshold. This is also easily done by writing an integer value to a file (you can put the following for example in the <code>/etc/rc.local</code> startup file):</p>
  
  <p>echo 60 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/up_threshold</p>
  
  <p>Here we’re saying that we’d like to have the Turbo Mode kick in when the CPU is busy at least 60% of the time. That is enough to make the Pi feel a little snappier during general use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also set to CPU governor to performance instead of ondemand using a similar command:</p>

<p><code>echo performance &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor</code></p>

<p>Performance will keep the CPU clocked at 100% all the time. Detailed information about the available modes can be found here: <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/governors.txt"">https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/governors.txt</a></p>

<p>This simulates turning the relevant led on/off in one thread while the program execution continues in the main thread. Crucially, the <code>flashLed</code> function doesn't lock up execution while the leds are blinking.</p>

<p>The main thread uses a global variable to set the led colour, with the other thread using the global variable to switch on the relevant led. I believe global variables are generally frowned upon, so I'd be interested to hear of any better approaches.</p>

"Is it possible to update, upgrade and install software before flashing an image?","11483","","<p>It seems silly to use our limited SD write cycles to upgrade the software shipped on the images. Can we upgrade the software and install new software before flashing an image to the SD card?</p>
","<h1>Yes</h1>

<p>The answer's always yes, right, just takes a while to work out how!</p>

<h1>The Hard Way</h1>

<p>I will be running this on a VPS, provided by <a href=""http://www.brightbox.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brightbox.com</a>. I used a Nano Server (2 CPUs, 512MB RAM, 20GB disk space) and a Ubuntu Precise 12.04 LTS server image. It should work on EC2's or Linode's equivalents, and of course, on your home Linux machine. I have now tested it on my (x86) Arch installation, but know it doesn't work on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS because some of the packages are too old.</p>

<h2>Preparing your system - Debian/Ubuntu</h2>

<p>Ensure your own system is up to date.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>Install some new software</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install binfmt-support qemu qemu-user-static unzip
</code></pre>

<p><code>qemu</code> is an ARM emulator, and <code>qemu-user-static</code> and <code>binfmt-support</code> allows us to run ARM executables without emulating the ARM kernel. (How cool is that!?!)</p>

<h2>Preparing your system - Arch</h2>

<p>I can't find a statically linked <code>qemu</code> in the Arch repositories, so we will have to compile from source.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the latest release from <a href=""http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/qemu.git"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/qemu.git</a></li>
<li><p>Unzip and run</p>

<p><code>./configure --disable-kvm --target-list=arm-linux-user --static</code></p></li>
<li><p>Build using <code>make</code> and install using <code>sudo make install</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the following as <code>root</code></p>

<p><code>echo   ':arm:M::\x7fELF\x01\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x28\x00:\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfe\xff\xff\xff:/usr/local/bin/qemu-arm:' &gt; /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register</code></p>

<p><code>echo   ':armeb:M::\x7fELF\x01\x02\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x28:\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfe\xff\xff:/usr/local/bin/qemu-armeb:' &gt; /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register</code></p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Warning</em> You shouldn't run arbitrary commands you find online as <code>root</code> - these were taken from <code>qemu-binfmt-conf.sh</code> under the ARM cpu type. Please extract the commands from this file and run those.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Download and unzip the image</h2>

<p>Go to <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">raspberrypi.org</a> and download the image you want. Unzip it and save the <code>.img</code> file somewhere useful.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo mkdir -p /images/debian-squeeze
$ sudo wget ""http://files.velocix.com/c1410/images/debian/6/debian6-19-04-2012/debian6-19-04-2012.zip"" -O ""/images/debian-squeeze.zip""
$ sudo unzip ""/images/debian-squeeze.zip"" -d /images/debian-squeeze
$ sudo rm /images/debian-squeeze.zip
</code></pre>

<h2>Find the correct partition</h2>

<p>The <code>.img</code> will contain 3 partitions, including the boot partition.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /images/debian-squeeze/debian6-19-04-2012/
$ fdisk -lu debian6-19-04-2012.img
Disk debian6-19-04-2012.img: 1949 MB, 1949999616 bytes
4 heads, 32 sectors/track, 29754 cylinders, total 3808593 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x000ee283

                 Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
debian6-19-04-2012.img1            2048      155647       76800    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
debian6-19-04-2012.img2          157696     3414015     1628160   83  Linux
debian6-19-04-2012.img3         3416064     3807231      195584   82  Linux swap / Solaris
</code></pre>

<p>We need to know the offset of the Linux partition, in this case it is <code>157696</code> sectors, and the boot partition, which is at <code>2048</code> sectors. Each sector is 512 bytes, so the root offset is <code>157696*512=80740352</code> bytes and the boot offset is <code>2048*512=1048576</code>.</p>

<h2>Mount the image as a loopback device</h2>

<p>Next, we need to mount the image as a file system. This can be done using a loopback device. We use the offset from the previous section to tell <code>mount</code> which partitions to mount and where. The order of these commands is important.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo mount -o loop,offset=80740352 ""/images/debian-squeeze/debian6-19-04-2012/debian6-19-04-2012.img"" /mnt
$ sudo mount -o loop,offset=1048576 ""/images/debian-squeeze/debian6-19-04-2012/debian6-19-04-2012.img"" /mnt/boot
</code></pre>

<h2>Preparing the filesystem.</h2>

<p>We're nearly ready to <code>chroot</code> into our file system and start installing new software. First, we must install the emulator into our image, as it won't be available once we use <code>chroot</code>.</p>

<h3>Debian/Ubuntu</h3>

<pre><code>$ sudo cp /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static /mnt/usr/bin/
</code></pre>

<h3>Arch Linux</h3>

<pre><code>$ sudo cp /usr/local/bin/qemu-arm /mnt/usr/local/bin/
</code></pre>

<h3>All host systems</h3>

<p>We also need to provide access to certain other parts of the system.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo mount --rbind /dev     /mnt/dev
$ sudo mount -t proc none     /mnt/proc
$ sudo mount -o bind /sys     /mnt/sys
</code></pre>

<h2>chroot</h2>

<p>We are done! <code>chroot</code> away...</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo chroot /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>You are now in your Raspberry Pi, but the services aren't running etc. Be careful, you are root!</p>

<h2>Update/Install software - Debian Image</h2>

<p>To update the software, we use <code>apt-get</code>.</p>

<pre><code> # apt-get update
 # apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>You can also install software using <code>apt-get install</code> as per usual.</p>

<h2>Update/Install software - Arch Image</h2>

<p>To update the software, we use <code>pacman</code>.</p>

<pre><code> # pacman -Syu
</code></pre>

<p>You can also install software using <code>pacman -S</code> as per usual.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>NOTE</em> You can run <code>pacman</code> natively by following the instructions on <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/42760/19208"">How do I run my native <code>pacman</code> against a mounted image?</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Exiting</h2>

<p>You can exit the <code>chroot</code> by using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> and unmount the system by running <code>sudo umount /mnt</code> - you will have to unmount each mount point separately..</p>

<p>You should remove <code>qemu-user-static</code> from <code>/usr/bin</code> or <code>qemu-arm</code> from <code>/usr/local/bin</code> on the RPi, then the image is ready to be flashed.</p>

<h2>Final Words</h2>

<p>This is a little long and tedious, but do it once and you'll learn loads about how this all works!</p>

<h2>Note on latest images</h2>

<p>When trying to run do this on the latest images, you will get an error</p>

<pre><code>qemu: uncaught target signal 4 (Illegal instruction) - core dumped
Illegal instruction (core dumped)
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this error, simply comment out the contents of the <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> file</p>

<h1>The Easy Way - <code>piimg</code></h1>

<p>I've started work on a utility for doing a lot of this for you. It is called <a href=""https://github.com/alexchamberlain/piimg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">piimg</a> and can be found at <a href=""https://github.com/alexchamberlain/piimg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">github.com/alexchamberlain/piimg</a>.</p>

<p>So far, it can mount the SD card for you by running</p>

<pre><code>piimg mount /images/debian-squeeze/debian6-19-04-2012/debian6-19-04-2012.img /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>and unmount them again by running</p>

<pre><code>piimg umount /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>You just need to install <code>qemu</code> and <code>chroot</code> away.</p>

<p><em>Later edit:</em> The <a href=""http://www.raspbmc.com/wiki/user/frequently-asked-questions/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raspbmc FAQ</a> also mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: Can I install Raspbmc to a USB drive?</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>A: Yes</strong> — but the SD card will still be needed to boot. This may seem futile then, however, the performance gains are admirable. This can be done easily through the Windows installer. For users installing via Python or manually, all that is needed is to create a file called ‘usb’ on the fat32 partition. The installer will then install to the first detected USB drive.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>The real only advantage I guess is space. The RPi has a SDHC spec. card reader, which allows SD cards upto 32GB. So if you want to add a 512GB USB pen drive, you can use that for the OS/files/etc and only boot from SD.</p>

<p>The reason to use a USB harddrive are besides space also speed, because these are much faster then any USB/SD memory. And they do not wear out as fast as USB/SD memory.</p>

"Is there an IDE I could use to edit code from a personal computer over the network in real time?","11418","","<p>I know it's possible to use FTP and various version control systems to upload or commit code developed on a full computer to the Raspberry Pi.  Another possibility would be to simply use SSH and Vim (or Emacs).  </p>

<p>Is there an IDE that supports real-time remote file editing (or is there a better alternative)?  Would putting a web server with a page running <a href=""https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace"">Ace</a> on the Raspberry Pi and using a browser from another machine be feasible (or sensible)?</p>
","<p>The IDE (probably) isn't the right place to be looking at this from. The simplest solution is to work with shared filesystems of some sort.</p>

<p>For exporting from the Rapsberry Pi the easiest way to export to a Linux (or I think Mac) host is to use <a href=""http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html"">sshfs</a>. You'll need to install that on the computer you want to work on (there are Debian/Ubuntu packages at least), but you won't need to alter the configuration of the Raspberry Pi itself at all.</p>

<p>You can then mount your home directory on the device on your other computer by simply doing:</p>

<pre><code>sshfs pi@192.168.1.2: /mnt/test
</code></pre>

<p>Where 192.168.1.2 is the address of your Raspberry Pi. After that it's just a matter of taking your favorite IDE and making it work in the directory you just mounted.</p>

<p>You could also install and configure Samba on the Raspberry Pi to export the filesystem as something Windows understands natively, or conversely mount a Windows share on the Raspberry Pi itself:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>aptitude install samba</code> to install Samba</li>
<li><code>smbpasswd -a pi</code> to set a password for Windows file sharing with the pi user</li>
<li>On the windows machine navigate to <code>\\192.168.1.2\pi</code> and enter the username/password you just configured. </li>
<li>(Optionally) map the drive more permanently to a letter by going to tools->map network drive in explorer</li>
</ol>

<p>Doing it at the filesystem layer avoids needing to have a customised IDE to support what is otherwise a pretty standard system, so leaves you more choices to work with the tools you're comfortable with. </p>

<p>Is this a sign of malfunctioning SD card or something else...? <em>( Also, I've noticed that doing certain commands, like arp,netstat etc is taking a longer time to compute..)</em></p>
","<p>It could be that your Pi is trying to do a reverse DNS lookup of the client's connecting hostname for security reasons, which is okay, but leads to the timeouts if you don't have a working reverse DNS.</p>

<p>when you do finally login, try adding</p>

<pre><code>UseDNS no

"Remote desktop connection to Raspberry Pi without specifying a port","11309","","<p>I have a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Wheezy connected in ""Site A"", where the network is managed by a third party company and where all ports are closed the the Internet (for security reasons). So, there is no way for me to do any port forwarding to VNC, nor SSH or anything else. That means I just can't access it in any way other than locally, on-site.</p>

<p>However, I need to connect to that device on the X Desktop session (graphical interface) to do some maintenance, and I am located in let's say ""Site B"", which is nearly 300 miles away from site A.</p>

<p>I know you can do such tasks on Windows or x86 Linux computers with TeamViewer (we use it for our other hardware in the same location and it works like a charm), but since the Raspberry Pi is based on an ARM architecture, it isn't supported by TeamViewer yet.</p>

<p>If anyone has ever achieved this, I would be glad to hear how to do it!</p>
","<p>What you would need to do is create a <strong>reverse SSH tunnel</strong>. You would have to configure the Pi to do this before you place it at the remote locations.</p>

<p>What happens is the Pi creates a connection from inside the network. With normal NAT that is considered safe and the connection is established and any data that comes back is routed to the correct IP. </p>

<p><em>Some professional firewalls might stop such actions on certain ports. You can overcome that by connecting out using port 80. Even more expensive firewalls inspect the packets to make sure they are not forged - In those cases there is not much you can do without figuring out a weak point.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>or your home/office with dyndns or static IP that will accept SSH connections</li>

<li>lets call the outside server <code>linuxbox.dyndns.ip</code> </li>
<li>Then on your Pi you will connect to your <code>linuxbox</code> and create a tunnel back to the Pi over SHH on port 222. </li>
<li>Any more Pi's will need to create tunnels using different ports, like 223, 224, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Issue this command on the remote Pi</p>

<pre><code>ssh -N -R 2222:localhost:22 serverUser@linuxbox.dyndns.ip
</code></pre>

<p>So the Pi connected to your linuxbox and created a tunnel within that connection back to the Pi :) On the linux box you will connect to the Pi using.</p>

","<h2>Some background</h2>

<p>The most important thing you should know is that the RaspberryPi is a strange beast where the <code>ARM CPU</code> is the not main CPU - it's only a co-processor to the <code>VideoCore GPU</code>. When the RaspberryPi starts, a GPU blob is read from the SD card to the L2 cache and executed. This code then brings up all the important peripherals (RAM, clocks etc) and starts the <code>ARM CPU</code>. Then the 2nd stage bootloader or some operating system itself can be run on <code>ARM CPU</code>.</p>

<p>GPU blob is not only a bootloader. It's actually an operating system (Video Core OS) by itself. Some important elements of the system are not directly accessible by ARM CPU and it has to communicate with <code>GPU</code> (using <code>mailbox</code> messaging system) to use them. There is <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/wiki"">partial documentation</a> about this available. Now <code>Video Core OS</code> (<code>VCOS</code>) is extended from time to time by Broadcom employees to enable features needed by <code>Linux</code> kernel, <code>RISC OS</code> or sometimes even some hobby OSes. There is no good documentation about this however, you would have to dig in the <code>RaspberryPi forum</code>, <code>github</code> and possibly other places to find information about this. But it's there.. somewhere. And there are a few people who write their own bare metal code or even OSes on the RaspberryPi to help you out. And of course a lot of open source code - RasbperryPi's Linux kernel for example.</p>

<p>VideoCore is proprietary, there is no official documentation and development tools. So unless you want to put a lot of effort, you can't rewrite <code>VCOS</code> with your own code. There is, however, some effort to reverse engineer the Video Core, you can find some information <a href=""https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Another problem is that the <code>USB</code> stack by Synopsys is proprietary and again there is no documentation for it and it seems that even with documentation it's hard to implement it reliably. But again, the code is available (Linux kernel, u-boot, <a href=""https://github.com/Chadderz121/csud"">CSUD</a>). Using advanced graphics capabilities of <code>Video Core</code> may also be hard - there is some <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland"">open source code</a> for the graphics libraries, but it's only for the <code>ARM</code> side.</p>

<p>That being said, it was possible to make the <code>RISC OS</code> port from the information available (it's not entirely clear to me if they were using only publicly accessible information, though), some people are rewriting (independently from Broadcom) the Linux kernel for mainline, there is a <code>FreeBSD</code> port, 'U-boot` and others. So it is definitively possible to write your own OS. It's just not as easy as it might possibly be.</p>

<h2>Your goals</h2>

<h3>Number 1</h3>

<p>As far as I know, there is no way that the SoC could start in another way than the one described. So first stage bootloader has to be on <code>SD card</code>. And it has to be a <code>GPU</code> binary, not an <code>ARM</code> binary which is another problem. And there is no on board flash in the RaspberryPi which is also a problem.</p>

<h3>Number 2</h3>

<p>The main problem is that there is no on-board <code>flash</code> on RaspberryPi. You could add one and it could be activated in your bootloader (which would have to be the 2nd stage bootloader already). Writing a USB driver could be problematic, however.</p>

<h3>Number 3, 4, 5</h3>

<p>This shouldn't be much of a problem. Most of the peripherals (at least those accessible to the <code>ARM</code>) are documented <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf"">here</a>. Existing bootloader makes this even easier since you get your SoC completely configured. You can look <a href=""https://github.com/dwelch67"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/freshers/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/"">here</a> for some code and documentation.</p>

<h3>Alternatives</h3>

<p>I don't know any other board as good as RaspberryPi so it's hard to recommend something but you may take a look at some mature projects like OMAP based <a href=""http://beagleboard.org/"">Beagleboard</a>/<a href=""http://beagleboard.org/bone"">Beaglebone</a>/<a href=""http://pandaboard.org/"">Pandaboard</a> or you can follow the development of some new boards like the Allwinner based <a href=""http://cubieboard.org/"">Cubieboard</a> or <a href=""https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pcduino"">PCduino</a>. It all depends on what exactly you want to accomplish. </p>

","<p>This is useless as you don't seem to run GPU RAM heavy OpenGL applications. You don't need more than 128MB GPU RAM to run videos smoothly as the hardware decoder will use only a fixed amount. So increasing it will not fix your issue. On the other hand you are reducing the RAM for the ARM CPU and therefore forcing it to use the Swapfile. This dramatically reduces your CPU performance. I can't believe your system even runs.</p>

","<p>You have a few options.</p>

<p><strong>PHP</strong></p>

<p>As long as we have python and .NET we must also have PHP. And as long as you got a LAMP installed then this is pretty straightforward. <a href=""http://davidwalsh.name/gmail-php-imap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is a example of PHP getting emails from GMAIL</a></p>

<ul>
<li>PROS - More likely choice for anybody using Linux as there are many examples and libraries.</li>
<li>CONS - If you don't like PHP you wills still use it but moan and groan...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MONO</strong></p>

<p>Purely because I am a .NET developer I had to test this and it does work. Just make an app in C#/VB and let it do what you need. Compile it as a console application and run it using mono on the Pi. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9801224/smtpclient-with-gmail"">And here is a good starting point.</a></p>

<ul>
<li>PROS - If you like .NET you can do allot of things with the code in that one binary. Xamarin and Raspberry Pi are supported/work together by/with Microsoft Open Source now making it more convenient for .NET'ies.</li>
<li>CONS - If you do not like .NET or the idea of installing MONO then not for you. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BASH</strong></p>

<p>You can try and use 3rd party programs to get mail and use bash to parse data and call other scripts.</p>

<ul>
<li>PROS - Not sure but its an option</li>
<li>CONS - Can be a bit complicated and wont work cross pc without all the dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Postfix</strong></p>

<p>If you can get postfix installed to recieve emails then you can tell it to <a href=""http://jeroensmeets.net/setup-postfix-to-forward-incoming-email-to-php/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dump the emails to a script</a>- any script, bash, php, python or java if you like. </p>

<p>Then your script can parse all this information easy. </p>

<ul>
<li>PROS- Easy enough if you can get postfix (or equivalent) installed</li>
<li>CONS - If  you have no static IP then you need dyndns</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remote Server</strong></p>

<p>This is obviously what you asked. You want to fetch email. This sounds easy enough but can be quite complex in trying to get the email and parsing it. But you are not alone because <a href=""http://mitchtech.net/connect-raspberry-pi-to-gmail-facebook-twitter-more"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here is a good tutorial</a> that uses python to parse your GMAIL RSS feed.</p>

<ul>
<li>PROS - You do not need to run a SMTP server like postfix behind dyndns </li>
<li>CONS - I would not do it like this because getting the emails, parsing them, connecting to remote servers seems complicated (and no 1 way) to do it. Prone to many errors</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>XMLHttpRequest</strong></p>

<p>This is a bit of experimental and combination of the two above. Allot of control panels (if you own a domain with some baisc hosting - like justhost) will allow you to dump selected emails to a script (like postfix above). You then parse it on that server and use curl to call your Pi (on DynDns if you dont have static) with specific commands and authentication.</p>

<ul>
<li>PROS- Decentralization and modularity.</li>
<li>CONS - Experimental</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Socks5 / HTML5 Web Messages</strong></p>

<p>As in your comment this is also a viable option. Socks opens a socket between the server and browser and stays open allowing you to send and receive messages instantly, between many connections. Node.JS Chat example is a good place to start. SignalR is amazing! And other languages support some kind of socks too.</p>

<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Remember to add some basic authentication in anything you do. Even in your emails put a line with encrypted text that your raspberry will decrypt so it knows its you and not some idiots attacking your system. To increase the security make it a mutating key that for example incorporates a timestamp(dd-mm-yy) so each day it will be encrypted differently but your Pi will know how to decrypt it.</li>
<li>You can automate your scripts using CRON</li>

"How to trigger GPIO event using an active infrared sensor","10931","","<p>Trying to get an active infrared sensor to trigger an event on a GPIO pin. I'm using python and the RPi.GPIO library on an RPi model B.</p>

<p>Some background info, not sure how relevant it is, but I'm a beginner, so not sure. I apologise in advance if my terminology is off.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have two LEDs wired to GPIO pins which show various activity. They are both working fine.</li>
<li>I have another LED wired directly from GPIO 3.3v pin to GPIO ground to show when power is active, this is also working fine.</li>
<li>The sensor has a master and slave part. I power the sensor from a 12v adapter, running the 12v and ground cables to the master, and then to the slave, along with another cable between the master and slave for sensor detection. I have measured this comms line (labelled T0) to be 4.53v, and when detection event occurs, this drops slightly to 4.51v.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried two different approaches to getting the sensor to trigger an GPIO event. </p>

<ol>
<li>Hooking into the T0 comms line. I did this by placing a few resistors in series to get under 3.3v as advised, and wiring the ground (from the 12v adapter) to a GPIO ground. My python code was looking for a GPIO.FALLING event.</li>
<li>Hooking into an LED on the master board which was lighting up on detection. This rose to 4.7v when detected and stayed at 0v when not. I desoldered the LED from the PCB and replaced with wire going to GPIO, i.e. the + side of the LED went to the GPIO pin, and the - side of the led when to a GPIO ground. Again I placed some resistors to get it under 3.3v. My python code was looking for a GPIO.RISING event.</li>
</ol>

<p>In both cases the GPIO event doesn't trigger. I've tried setting GPIO.IN with neither pull_up_down specified, and both GPIO.PUD_UP and GPIO.PUD_DOWN set.</p>

<p>I feel the second approach should be easier to work with, which is what I've focused on, but I just can't get the detection to register on the GPIO. I'm guessing I've gotten my resistor values wrong or perhaps wired the ground wrong?  </p>

<p>One possible clue - if I try to use a multimeter to read the output <em>after</em> the resistors, an GPIO event is triggered, but it doesn't trigger if I read it before the resistors.</p>

<p>Any help appreciated, thanks!</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>A friend recommended the second option was the easiest and suggested I ensure the sensor and pi have a common ground, as well as try something more simple first, specifically, write some python code to poll the GPIO pin and using a GPIO power port to trigger an event. Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

sensor = 7
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(sensor, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)
current = GPIO.input(sensor)
previous = current
def printState(current):
    print 'GPIO pin %s is %s' % (sensor, 'HIGH' if current else 'LOW')
printState(current)
while True:
    current = GPIO.input(sensor)
    if current != previous:
        printState(current)
    previous = current
    time.sleep(0.1)
GPIO.cleanup()
</code></pre>

<p>And this works perfectly! I use a wire connected to 3.3v GPIO pin and touch the sensor pin (GPIO pin 7) and the state changes from initial value of LOW to HIGH and stays HIGH as long as I keep them connected. That confirms port setup is working and my problem something to do with either the grounding, the resistor value or (unlikely) the RISING event.</p>
","<p>OK, thanks for the input folks, it's working beautifully now.</p>

<p>As gnibbler alluded to in the comments, I needed to connect the ground from the sensor and the RPi.  </p>

<p>I also had too high a resistance value between the LED and the GPIO.IN pin, which I was able to determine by expanding on the first debug test, i.e. touching the 3.3v before the resistor didn't trigger the event, but touching it after the resistor did.</p>

<p>The circuit is really simple:</p>

<p>Sensor + LED -> 1.2K resistor -> GPIO.IN on lucky pin 7</p>

<p>Additionally, the sensor ground and RPi grounds are now wired together, and I didn't need to wire the - side of the LED to a GPIO ground pin.</p>

<p>To be honest, I just guessed the resistor value by trial and error, and hoped that I didn't blow up the RPi, as I wasn't sure how to calculate the current coming out of the sensor LED? I know it was under 5v and needed a 1.7v+ drop, but how do you determine current if you don't know what else is drawing power on the circuit?</p>

"What bitrate can I get from an i2c bus?","10931","","<p>In short, what is the maximum bitrate that can be achieved writing to an I2C bus from a Raspberry Pi? Should it be the theoretical maximum of 100KB/s?</p>

<p>In more detail, I'm writing to an I2C bus from my Pi, sending messages to 10 PWM microcontrollers, each with 16 channels. (The model is <a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/products/815"" rel=""nofollow"">Adafruit's PCA9685</a>).</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to update these registers at something like 10-20Hz. Each channel has a 2-byte register, so naively I'd expect that to equate to 16 * 10 * 20 = 3.2KB/s. That's well within the protocol's limit of 100KB/s.</p>

<p>However, when I try to drive these microcontrollers from a Python script running on my Pi, I'm only able to achieve about 2Hz update frequency; I've profiled the code and most of the time spent is in the library that's actually calling out to the /dev/i2c* device.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there's a hardware or driver restriction that limits the bitrate?</p>

<p>I'm using a 1st generation model B, Raspbian version 2015-02-16.</p>
","<p>The I2C clock bps (bits per second) can be set between 125 Mb/s and 3826 b/s (250Mhz core clock with even divider between 2 and 65536). <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2835/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BCM2835 ARM Peripherals</a> pages 28-36.</p>

<p>In practice speeds higher than 30 Mb/s are unlikely to work.</p>

<p>The maximum bps I've heard of is 3.4 Mb/s but I don't remember any evidence being offered.</p>

<p>Bit rates of 400 kb/s (a sort of standard) and 1 Mb/s are common.</p>

<p>If you are not using device tree (unlikely with a recent kernel) then use </p>

<pre><code>sudo modprobe i2c_bcm2708 baudrate=xxx
</code></pre>

<p>to set the speed.</p>

<p>With device tree use the following entries in /boot/config.txt</p>

<pre><code>dtparam=i2c1=on
dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=xxx
</code></pre>

<p>With the Linux kernel SPI driver the limiting thoughput factor is the number of SPI calls you can make per second (roughly 20k).  I don't know if the Linux kernel I2C driver has the same problem.</p>

<p>First, make sure the spi module is enabled.
In the file <code>/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf</code> comment out the line:</p>

<pre><code>#blacklist spi-bcm2708
</code></pre>

<p>There is a project called <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/webiopi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">webiopi</a>. The project has a python lib that supports a couple ADCs. The supported ADCs are <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/webiopi/wiki/MCP3000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">listed in this page</a> and include the MCP3204.
To install just the python library I used:</p>

<pre><code>wget https://webiopi.googlecode.com/files/WebIOPi-0.6.0.tar.gz
tar xzvf WebIOPi-0.6.0.tar.gz
cd WebIOPi-0.6.0/python
sudo python setup.py install
</code></pre>

<p>(though I used a virtualenv).</p>

<p>Then I could pull data from the PI using this script, <strong>run as SUDO</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>from webiopi.devices.analog import MCP3004, MCP3008, MCP3204, MCP3208

# Setup a MCP3204 on SPI CE0
mcp0 = MCP3204()
print mcp0.analogReadAllVolt()

<ol>
<li>Vcc and Vref to +3.3 </li>
<li>Analog Ground to Ground</li>
<li>SCLK to SP10 SCLK</li>
<li>CS/SHDN to SP10 CE0 N</li>
<li>CH0 to some resistor (or what you want to measure)</li>
<li>Digital ground to ground</li>
<li>Din to SPI MOSI </li>

","<p>The Pi's memory cannot be increased beyond the 256mb or 512mb that board comes with. This memory can be split differently between the CPU and GPU.

","<p>Alternative answer - to support higher resolutions - for streaming video alone (no remote control):
on desktop: use VLC to encode your screen with h264 and serve it over http (you should be able to do it with help of GUI)
on raspberry: use omxplayer, as it takes advantage of hardware decoder to play your h264 high resolution stream. If omxplayer won't support http out of the box use mkfifo, like this:</p>

"Does Raspberry Pi cluster make sense for a small rendering farm","10739","","<p>I have seen bunch of articles saying how raspberries could be joined to make a cluster. I basically am a 3d artist type thing and you know rendering a 10 second animation can take hours.</p>

<p>So if I make a cluster of about 20 or more raspberries with each having 1 GB RAM will the end result have 20 GB RAM? I just want to know what will be the role of cluster regarding the RAM? I am concerned about RAM because that's what troubles me... I don't concentrate on the processor but RAM.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience P.S. My first question here.</p>
","<p>Short answer: probably</p>

<p>It really depends on whether or not the process is able to be parallelized. Some processes just can't be split among the RPi's and therefore would not have any benefit from a cluster. But, rendering animations sounds like a task that would be able to be split up and therefore would benefit from a cluster. </p>

<p>@Thingian said that it introduces a lot of network latency, this is true however i don't know to much about rendering but once again i think that this would effect it little as when rendering the different process probably dont need to ""talk"" with one another all that much.</p>

<p>If you would like some more insight into this I'd recommend you use <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/3990/how-to-build-a-graphics-cluster?rq=1"">this question</a> and 
this <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=18356"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">related forum thread</a> from the official RPi forum (though this has less to with graphics and more with general clustering)  as well as <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/87/how-do-i-build-a-cluster"">How do I build a cluster?</a></p>

<p>If you'd like to buy the setup with minimal amounts of work on your part Iden .inc <a href=""http://idein.jp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://idein.jp</a> is <a href=""http://www.geek.com/chips/raspberry-pi-zero-cluster-in-development-1645823/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">building a board</a> and that would make it easier for you to connect 16 RPi zeros and it would probably take care of the connections and make you desk look a little less like a rat nest (IF you can find the zeros as they are extremely scarce right now)</p>

"Getting the latest version of R on the Raspberry Pi","10733","","<p>I have a Raspi that runs Debian Jessie (downloaded from the <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/"" rel=""noreferrer"">official Raspberry Download Website</a> (Version 2015-11-21)). For one of my projects I want to use the software r and some of the very useful packages (data.table and ggplot2 if you want to know). However, these packages require the latest r-version (currently 3.2.3 according to <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CRAN</a>, at least for windows). The official <a href=""https://packages.debian.org/stable/gnu-r/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Debian Package Site</a> lists 3.1.1 as the latest version. </p>

<p>If I run <code>sudo apt-get update</code>, and then <code>sudo apt-get install r-base</code>, followed by <code>sudo R</code> I see that I have version 3.1.1 installed (thus, <code>install.packages(""data.table"")</code> in R returns that it does not exist for this older version). </p>

<p>Now my question is: How can I install the latest version of R (3.2.3), or alternatively how can I install the two packages? </p>

<p><strong>First Try</strong> I tried to follow the official description on the <a href=""https://cran.rstudio.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CRAN-site</a> (the link doesn't work properly, you need to click through: Download R for Linux -> Debian and then scroll down to ""Supported Branches"" and ""Jessie"", where it gives advice to Jessie users.

<p>Beware that binary packages from there, such as the R interpreter itself, will only work on specific architectures, presumably at least x86 and x86_64.</p>

<p>But you would need one compiled for ARMv6. If you are using a Pi 2 you could also use ARMv7, which is more commonplace, but likely still not available in the repository. </p>

<p>This is why adding that repo will not allow you to upgrade the R version -- you would not and cannot have the proper dependencies available for an x86(-64) binary package, so it cannot offer you the higher version.</p>

<p>There may be pure R packages from there that you can use but obviously if they depend on a higher version of the interpreter then you will need to find that somewhere first.</p>

"Whenever I install Iceweasel it installs Firefox instead","10623","","<p>I used the following command to install Iceweasel.</p>

<p>However, instead of Iceweasel, I get Firefox. Not that I'm complaining much, I love Firefox. </p>

<p>If you click on <kbd>Menu</kbd> > <kbd>Internet</kbd>, there are 2 Firefox logos. One says Firefox ESR, and the other says Iceweasel > Firefox ESR.</p>

<p>But I have no idea why it's doing this. Has Iceweasel been discontinued and Firefox linked to the Iceweasel install? </p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Iceweasel was rebranded <em>back</em> to Firefox in Feb '16. You can no longer install Iceweasel.</p>

<h2>Background Info</h2>

<p>Firefox is open source. This means that anyone can freely distribute and modify the source code. </p>

<p>However, the laws surrounding the trademark 'Firefox' and the Firefox logo are slightly different. The trademark and logo may only be used with unmodified/official versions of the source code. (This is because Mozilla wants users to have a consistent experience when using 'Firefox')</p>

<p>Debian (the Linux distro which Raspbian is based off) has a set of guidelines called the <a href=""https://www.debian.org/social_contract"">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>, which determines what software is allowed to be included in Debian. </p>

<p>Because the restrictions placed on the logo and trademark were not compatible with the guidelines, the distribution of Firefox to be included in Debian had to be rebranded. After many debates etc, the name <em>Iceweasel</em> was born and Firefox was rebranded. </p>

<p>However, in February 2016, Mozilla allowed Debian to use the Firefox trademark and logos in their distributions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mozilla recognizes that patches applied to Iceweasel/Firefox don't
  impact the quality of the product.</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>In case of derivatives of Debian, Firefox branding can be used as long
  as the patches applied are in the same category as described above.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>So why can't I install Iceweasel?</h2>

<p>Because Iceweasel has been rebranded to Firefox, the Iceweasel package has been discontinued, and instead Firefox is automatically installed. You can no longer install Iceweasel.</p>

","<p>I see two things that should be addressed in this question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How to connect and communicate with the <a href=""http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlc5940.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">TLC5940</a></p></li>
<li><p>How to connect LEDs up to the <a href=""http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlc5940.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">TLC5940</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the first part, you will need to connect it to the i2c pins of the Raspberry Pi's P1 header (which are pins 3 (data) and 5 (clock)).  You can then use pin 1 (3.3 V) for the VCC of the <a href=""http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlc5940.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">TLC5940</a>.  It recommends from 3 V to 5.5 V for input according to the datasheet.  You will also want to connect a ground pin from P1 (e.g. pin 5) to the GND of the <a href=""http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlc5940.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">TLC5940</a>.  And you will need an additional GPIO (e.g. pin 7) to connect to the <a href=""http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlc5940.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">TLC5940</a>'s XLAT signal to latch in the value of the shift register.</p>

<p>Then you will need to setup the Pi for i2c communication:  assuming raspbian, remove <code>i2c-bcm2708</code> from <code>/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf</code>, load it and <code>i2c-dev</code> and you should get <code>/dev/i2c-0</code> and <code>/dev/i2c-1</code> (<code>i2c-1</code> is what you will need to use for Model B Rev. 2 Pis).</p>

<p>Finally, you will need to use an i2c transaction to set the value of the internal shift register, and then signal the XLAT (if using pin 7, it's GPIO 4).</p>

<p>I also overlooked the GSCLK pin.  You will need to provide a clock input so that the internal counter actually increments, which can be done from another GPIO line if it's configured correctly.  I also don't think the 3.3 V rail will provide sufficient current for this application (<a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#Power_pins"" rel=""nofollow"">50 mA max</a>).  If you move to the 5 V rail, you can draw up to <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#Power_pins"" rel=""nofollow"">~300 mA</a>, but should use 5 V logic for i2c then (and the GSCLK), requiring more components.</p>

<li>HDMI/Composite input?</li>
<li>Touchscreen functionality?</li>

<li>An inexpensive solution?</li>

</ul>

<p>The answers to these questions will help you to determine where and how to search for your monitor.</p>

<p>Some options:</p>

<p><strong>Portable DVD players/Second DVD player screens/Portable TVs</strong></p>

<p>Some portable DVD players, car rear view mirror camera screens, and portable TV screens have composite inputs.  They are made by a large variety of manufacturers.  They often have built in speakers and sound inputs.  They may or may not come with car/AC adapters.  They may have included batteries.  The resolution is usually much lower than comparable computer monitors.  Verify that the screen has composite input, and then verify if the connectors are on the device, or if the composite A/V input requires some sort of ""AV-in"" conversion cable.  Re-purposing these screens for your Raspberry Pi may save you some money and still fit your needs. </p>

<p><strong>Professional photography/videography screens</strong></p>

<p>Some monitors have been created for use in digital photography and videography, such as those made by <a href=""http://www.lilliput.com/c/3/lilliput-camera-monitor"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lilliput</a>.  They usually have an internal/external battery and often have HDMI input, and have the option of sun shades to deflect sunlight, as well as mounts (usually for being mounted to a camera or tripod.  The resolution and brightness may be the best you can find.  However, the price is quite a bit higher than some of the other monitors available in this size.</p>

<p><strong>Car PC / Carputer monitors</strong></p>

<p>There are also a fair number of ""carputer"" screens, some of which have DVI/HDMI input and even touchscreen functionality.  The cost for these screens is higher, and the touchscreen may or may not be easy to set up in Linux, and they may only accept DC power natively (due to being designed for use in cars) but it may provide you with a more complete solution when all is said and done.</p>

<p><strong>Standalone monitors (USB)</strong></p>

<p>The next set of monitors to look into would be the standalone USB monitors, such as those made by <a href=""http://www.mimomonitors.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">MIMO</a> and <a href=""http://www.lilliput.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lilliput</a>.  Upon first glance, they seem like the best option, because they only require USB input, but display drivers may be hard to come by, and the Raspberry Pi may not be powerful enough to feed the screen the power it needs.  </p>

<p><strong>Small computer monitors/touchscreens</strong></p>

<p>Some small computer monitors or touchscreens also exist on the market, mainly by Mimo and Lilliput again.  Some of these monitors have touchscreen functionality.  These are differentiated from professional photographer screens by their lack of battery power.  Driver support for touchscreens may work, or may not.  Tread carefully.  These monitors tend to be on the more expensive side, in general.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>If price didn't matter to me, I probably would have purchased one of the Lilliput monitors, but price does matter to me, so I didn't.
I ended up deciding on a DVD ""second screen"" that had an included mount and AC adapter on eBay.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iGUmI.jpg"" alt=""second screen"">
Sound inputs are included, and it has AC power.  I don't plan on my usage requiring anything too fancy in the resolution department, and I was looking for the most cost-effective way to get my Raspberry Pi running.  Getting it from ebay meant that I paid a pittance ($20), but I had to lurk around a lot of different auctions to find it at that price, since they're usually closer to $50.  This also means that I don't have a warranty and I'm purchasing a product more or less sight unseen, so I may not have the image quality that I was originally hoping for.  In my case, it worked fine when I hooked it up, as evidenced below:

<p>It all depends on what you value most in your screen.  Your mileage may vary.</p>

","<p>The ampersand (for sending a process in the background) is not necessary for commands issued to cron via the crontab as processes are already forked.

","<p>I just did successfully this with my Mac a few days ago. I'm not sure if the instructions would be the some for Linux/Windows, but hopefully some of these parts will be relevant/useful to you. </p>

<p>Caveat: These instructions tell you how to <em>manually</em> configure the interface because that was the only way that worked for me. </p>

<p>Notes: I own a late 2011 MacBook Air, and I have Raspbian installed on my RPi. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Assign a static IP address to the Ethernet interface on your Mac. (<strong>System Preferences</strong> -> <strong>Network</strong>). Next to <strong>Configure IPv4</strong>, select <strong>Manually</strong> in the dropdown. For the IP address, assign something in the <code>10.x.x.x</code> pattern (I used <code>10.2.2.2</code>, for example), and for the DNS server, you can enter, for example, <code>8.8.8.8</code> (one of <a href=""https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/"" rel=""nofollow"">Google's Public DNS servers</a>; another one is <code>8.8.4.4</code>. You can also go the <a href=""http://www.opendns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenDNS</a> route, which would be <code>208.67.222.222</code> or <code>208.67.220.220</code>). </p></li>
<li><p>Configure the <code>eth0</code> interface on your RPi. If you're paranoid (like I am), make a backup first: </p>

<p><code>
$ sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.bak
</code></p>

<p>Then open the file for editing with vim (or whichever editor you prefer): </p>

<p><code>
$ sudo vim.tiny /etc/network/interfaces
</code></p>

<p>You'll see the following: </p>

<pre><code>auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp
</code></pre>

<p>Go ahead and change it to:</p>

<pre><code>auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static

address 10.2.2.3 # or whichever unused IP you want to assign to the RPi
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 10.2.2.2 # i.e. IP that you assigned the ethernet in step 1
network 10.2.2.0
broadcast 10.2.2.255
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now edit <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> (<code>$ sudo vim.tiny /etc/resolv.conf</code>): </p>

<p>Change the contents to: </p>

<p><code>
nameserver 10.2.2.2
nameserver 8.8.8.8 
nameserver 8.8.4.4
</code></p>

<p>Again, change the last two nameservers to whichever DNS you prefer. </p></li>
<li><p>Now reboot your RPi (<code>sudo reboot</code>). </p></li>
<li><p>Turn on Internet Sharing on your Mac: <strong>System Preferences</strong> -> <strong>Sharing</strong> -> <strong>Internet Sharing</strong>. Next to <strong>Sharing your connection from</strong>, select however you're connected to the internet on your Mac (in my case, AirPort). Then, under <strong>To computers under</strong>, select <strong>Ethernet</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>Once your RPi has booted up again, check its new static IP address: </p>

<p><code>
$ ifconfig
</code></p></li>

"How to communicate between Pi 3 and an Arduino using UART from GPIO?","10450","","<p>I need to transfer data between Arduino and Pi.

The problem is that this code doesn't have software debounce implemented. </p>

<p>Can you please give me advice about how software debounce can be implemented, or alternatively, how to easily implement a hardware debouncing system?</p>
","<p>I have never tried to do this no the RPi, but I have on the Arduino platform several times, and I have used something along the lines of this Arduino code.  Note you will have to rewrite a function similar to this for whatever language you are using:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned long last_interrupt_time = 0;

void my_interrupt_handler()
{
  unsigned long interrupt_time = millis();
  // If interrupts come faster than 200ms, assume it's a bounce and ignore
  if (interrupt_time - last_interrupt_time &gt; 200) 
  {
    ... Interrupt okay, do something;
  }
  last_interrupt_time = interrupt_time;

"Is it possible to wirelessly turn the raspberry pi on/off?","10363","","<p>I thought about getting a RPi 2 B and install Retropie to relive my childhood and play some oldschool games with my girlfriend(she really loves the idea). Right now I don't have a RPi, but I got 2 wireless xbox 360 controller that I don't use often. </p>

<p>I would like to sit down and press a button on a remote or controller and start the ""console"". As far as I know right now you have to plug in the micro usb cable to turn the RPi on and use a shutdown command to shut it down. </p>

<p>In Retropie it's easier to shut down as there's a shutdown option in the main menu. But my concern is that I use a multi power extension outlet with a on/off button. Most of the time the extention outlet is turned off, but if I want to watch something on Netflix I turn it on and turn it off if I am done watching tv. </p>

<p>Wouldn't that mean I would power the RPi on(booting up etc) and off all the time I just want to watch TV? </p>

<p>I have read that you shouldn't just power off the Pi but shut it down via command and then unplug it, or the sdcard gets corrupted.</p>

<p>Is there a way to stop the Pi from booting up if energy is flowing and is there a way to wirelessly turn it on/off?</p>
","<p>Kept researching and found the remote Pi Board.
Although it's expensive it's exactly what i was looking for.

<blockquote>
  <p>Pros:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>very small</li>
  <li>may need some modification to your raspberry pi case, but otherwise fits within the existing case (doesn't extend out from the board's footprint)</li>
  <li>addresses the CLEAN SHUTDOWN and POWER OFF requirements fully</li>
  <li>no issues with provided switch script</li>
  <li>fully integrated IR receiver that can be used to allow your IR remote to control XBMC</li>
  <li>everything fully assembled</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Cons:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>expensive but it does save you cost from building your own IR receiver setup or USB IR receiver </li>

"Raspberry Pi 2 stuck on boot","10355","","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WL2o4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Rasp PI 2 stuck on boot. The red light is stable and green light flash few times during start up and later stopped. Then screen also freezed. Any Idea?</p>

<p>EDIT : It is solved. Change a new power supply with higher ampere and everything works fine.</p>
","<p>This is likely caused by an undersupply of current. As per the conversation in the comments - you are seeing a rainbow-colored square in the top right corner of your screen (not on your picture) which is the rPi telling you that it doesn't have enough power supplied to it. Switch to a more powerful supply such as <a href=""http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/28-17985"" rel=""nofollow"">this 5V 2.2A supply</a> and it will likely boot all the way. Or alternatively remove some of your USB peripherals (disk, wifi, mouse) to reduce the power consumption of your setup.</p>

<p>EDIT: And if you are indeed already using a 5V 2.4A supply, you have a faulty supply, because 2.4A should be enough to boot an rPi with keyboard, mouse and WiFi attached. I use a cheap USB volt/amp meter (<a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/1pcs-USB-Current-Tester-USB-voltmeter-USB-ammeter-Ampere-Meter-blue-color-/331534363972?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item4d30fced44"" rel=""nofollow"">like this one</a>) in combination with a microUSB-to-USB adapter to check how much amps my power supplies provide - sometimes what they claim they deliver is far from what they actually deliver, the Amp rating might be maximum ""burst"" or ""peak"" Amps, not the continuous supply capability.</p>

"GPIO: Why wire button to ground rather than +3.3v?","10351","","<p>In most examples I've seen of wiring buttons to GPIO inputs, the button is wired so that when closed, a circuit is completed between the pin and ground, producing a low input on the pin. A pull-up resistor is used to default the input value to high. Code on the Pi can then detect low as a button push.</p>

<p>I've been connecting the buttons to +3.3v so the signal is high as this seems to make more sense and keeps the code more logical but there must be a reason that most people favour connecting to ground. What are the advantages?</p>
","<p>One of the main reasons why wiring buttons and logic to GND is favoured (and then copied all over the internet) is because of power optimization.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pulling a pin LOW with resistor to GND costs 0 watts. </li>
<li>Pulling a pin HIGH with resistor to +Vcc costs power.</li>
</ul>

<p>On complex circuits or circuits that rely on batteries this power is very precious.</p>

<p><em>Other reasons include low EMF generation. On Wireless devices pulling logic high will cause unnecessary cross talk on extremely sensitive RF receivers. On such transceivers there is a GND plane used to filter noise and this is where all logic gets pulled down to. The processor then uses the GND plane to filter switching noises.</em></p>

"Build custom Raspbian Jessie distribution image from source","10341","","<p>I am wanting to generate a custom image of Raspbian Jessie (primarily modifying the UI and adding some extra packages).</p>

<p>Thusfar, I have taken the image provided by the Foundation, modified it 'after the fact' and then taken a backup of the image from the SD card to then distribute. Obviously, this leaves 'fingerprints' on the image and can also makes it difficult to reproduce the steps, should it be required.</p>

<p>I have looked at <a href=""http://asbradbury.org/projects/spindle/"">Spindle</a>, however it seems to have not been updated for Jessie yet. Other tools' documentation has been a bit intimidating, and have left me feeling as though there is a gap in my understanding to be able to achieve what I am trying to do.</p>

<p>What is the easiest way to build a custom version of Raspbian Jessie that would be considered suitable for distribution? Buildroot, Yocto project, OpenEmbedded? How does the Foundation make their image?</p>

<p>Tools, tutorials, documentation, etc. are all welcome - I am really looking for a point of reference to be able to work from with a bit more confidence.</p>
","<p>I have since learnt that the Raspberry Pi foundation uses this repository for generating their images: </p>

<p>This can be modified to create an image as desired, though documentation is currently quite lacking. I would recommend using the base branch for developing from a stable build.</p>

"Running Jetty webserver","10339","","<p>I just installed Jetty 6.1.18 on my raspberry pi via apt-get but I have trouble running it.</p>

<p>It works fine when using the start.jar directly (in /usr/share/jetty) with <code>sudo java -jar start.jar</code>, so I can see the ""welcome to Jetty"" html page when pointing a browser to my pi's IP address </p>

<p>But if it doesn't work if I start it using <code>sudo /etc/init.d/jetty start</code> although the output is:</p>

<pre><code>[....] Starting Jetty servlet engine.: jetty Rotate logs[....] Jetty servlet engine started, reachable on http://raspberrypi:8080/.: jetty.
</code></pre>

<p>so no apparent warnings or problems...</p>

<p>Using OpenJDK as JVM, output of <code>echo $JAVA_HOME</code> is <code>/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-armhf</code></p>

<p>and I edited <code>/etc/default/jetty</code> to reflect <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> there</p>

<p>Has anybody seen a similar issue with jetty or other webservers? Obviously, I'd like the init.d script to work, so that the webserver is up and running at startup automatically...</p>

<p>For info, here is the actual /etc/init.d/jetty script:</p>

","<p>That cable is most likely a DisplayPort-to-HDMI cable not a HDMI-to-DisplayPort cable (mind the direction).

"Unable to forward external ssh port through router to raspbmc","10248","","<p>I am trying to expose my <a href=""http://www.raspbmc.com"">raspbmc</a>'s ssh port to the world through my internet router.  I can connect to the device on my LAN.  I have another Windows 7 machine with cygwin and sshd installed on it and I can ssh  into that machine through my firewall.  I believe I know how to configure my router to forward ports. </p>

<p>Here's what I tried:</p>

<h1>Attempt 1</h1>

<ul>
<li>Forward external port 22222 to port 22 on my raspbmc</li>
<li>Connect to port 22222 on my external ip with:
<PRE>

debug1: connect to address MY_IP port 22222: Connection timed out
ssh: connect to host MY_IP port 22222: Connection timed out
</PRE>
Doing this, but forwarding to my Win7 box works, seemingly indicating that I know how to configure my router.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Attempt 2</h1>

<p>Then I tried turning off port 22 forwarding to my Win7 machine and forwarding external port 22 to my rapsbmc's port 22, such that the only tweaking that I did of the router configuration was to change which LAN address the packets were forwarded to.  Connections to Win7 box stopped [expected], but connections to raspbmc did not work:</p>

<pre><code> sudo find / -name sshd

<p>yields nothing.</p>
","<p>Ugg.  I wasn't able to solve my own problem the other day, but when I typed out the question, then I got inspired to search the interwebs in a different way that <a href=""http://forum.stmlabs.com/showthread.php?tid=6726""><strong>yielded</strong></a> a <a href=""http://forum.stmlabs.com/showthread.php?tid=6850""><strong>solution</strong></a>.  My issue was that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables""><code>iptables</code></a> is configured to block traffic that isn't on my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork"">subnet</a>.  You can test that this is the issue by running this command on your raspbmc:</p>

<pre><code>sudo iptables --flush
</code></pre>

<p>If you're able to receive the ssh connections on your raspbmc now, then you need to tweak the <code>iptables</code> commands in <code>/etc/network/if-up.d/secure-rmc</code> such that it will not block non-subnet traffic:</p>

<pre><code>logger -t iptables ""Configuring ip tables for interface $IFACE""
if [ ""$IFACE"" != ""lo"" ]; then
    NETMASK=$(get_subnet $IFACE)
    iptables -A INPUT -s $NETMASK -i $IFACE -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -i $IFACE -j DROP
fi
</code></pre>

<p>I commented out those lines with <code>#</code> using command <code>sudo vi /etc/network/if-up.d/secure-rmc</code>.  Those lines now look like:</p>

<pre><code>#logger -t iptables ""Configuring ip tables for interface $IFACE""
#if [ ""$IFACE"" != ""lo"" ]; then
#    NETMASK=$(get_subnet $IFACE)
#    iptables -A INPUT -s $NETMASK -i $IFACE -j ACCEPT
#    iptables -A INPUT -i $IFACE -j DROP
#fi

<p>Then, when you reboot, it should be resolved.  This will make your raspbmc listening ports be wide open to accepting any packets from outside your network, for better or worse...</p>

"How to add isolation between raspberry pi and relay board?","10204","","<p>I want to use my Raspberry Pi to control mains(fans,lamp on 240v). Its very difficult to procure a good and reliable relay board for me in India. After bit of searching, I have decided to go with <a href=""http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/grove-relay-p-769.html?cPath=39_42"">Seeed Studio's Groove Relay</a>. Here are details: </p>

<p>Specifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operating Voltage: 3.3V~5V </li>
<li>Max Switching Voltage: 250VAC/30VDC </li>
<li>Max Switching Current: 5A </li>
</ul>

<p>If I understand correctly, opto coupler relays provide isolation. However as this product does not come with opto coupler, how do I add isolation? </p>

<ul>
<li>Is isolation really important between relay &amp; raspberry pi?</li>
<li>How do I add isolation between raspberry pi and relay board?</li>
<li>Adding ULN2003 between Pi and relay board would solve the problem? </li>
</ul>
","<p>Relays are pretty safe to use without any special isolation like optocouplers. The reason people recommend optocouplers in DIY projects... well because its DIY and an optocoupler is safer in case of something going wrong.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q30TC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The input pins power a coil and push or pull a lever using some kind of snap hinge to eliminate bounce and sparks. <strong>So you are already isolated by air (~1000v per 1mm of air protection)</strong>. Optocouplers turn on the coil using a light beam on the switch, which help isolate the MCU from flyback EMF, and possible relay short circuit.</p>

<p>A relay will (or should) have a diode to protect your device from electromagnetic flyback voltages, and the one from Seeed has this built in.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qBapN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The widely accepted way of driving a relay with a MCU pin is to use a transistor to ""switch"" GND and power the relay from a <strong>separate dedicated power</strong> supply/pin instead form the IO.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4qyrw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You would then supply 5Volts into the relay Vcc direct from the 5V apapter that connects to the Raspberry, NOT from the Raspberry itself. The transistor, when you pull up a GPIO will ""connect"" the GND and the relay will work. Transistor have diodes built in and also also offer other protection to the GPIO. Transistors are well marked and you you can use a variety of them. If anything weird happens with the relay the transistor will blow up saving the MCU in normal environments. The worst case scenario is lightning striking it, then, sadly allot of things break.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/index.php?title=GROVE_-_Starter_Kit_v1.1b#Grove_-_Relay"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The schematics for the device you pointed out already contain all this circuitry.</a> Isnt that nice of them :) It means you are protected and you just need to connect 3 wires, since all the above is ALREADY on the PCB :) Notice a 4.7K resistor in between D1 and Q1. Q1 is the transistor and you also have an LED show when the relay is active :) </p>

<p><strong>Now just take care when connected 220v to J1 - You run LIVE to the relay. So you switch LIVE on AC and not GND. Do not connect LIVE and NEUTRAL into there.</strong>   </p>

","<p><strong>Update 2014-01-29:</strong> It has <a href=""http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-snapshots/2014-January/000066.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">just been announced</a> that the arm/armv6 snapshot images for Raspberry Pi are now being pushed up to the FreeBSD FTP servers on a weekly basis. You can download a copy from your <a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html#mirrors-ca-ftp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">local FreeBSD FTP mirror</a>, in the <code>/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/ISO-IMAGES/</code> folder.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2014-01-28:</strong> Glen Barber kindly published this <a href=""http://people.freebsd.org/~gjb/RPI/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SD image of the recent FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE</a>, which has also made huge progress in supporting the hardware. So just grab that for the easiest way to install (of course you can still <a href=""https://wiki.freebsd.org/FreeBSD/arm/Raspberry%20Pi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">build your own</a> too).</p>

<p><strong>Update 2012-10-30:</strong> Updated image and instructions to latest CVS - now with root on SD</p>

<p>I've set up a VM and built the image myself - here's the result.</p>

<h1>Caveats</h1>

<p>Although there's been lots of progress, keep in mind it's still early days and you're playing around with prerelease code. Don't put this in production. </p>

<p>Stuff that isn't working yet (in this particular checkout):</p>

<ul>
<li>USB keyboard (at least mine doesn't work, despite being recognised - YMMV)</li>
<li>U-boot doesn't seem to care about uEnv.txt, so the root fs location is hardcoded in the kernel</li>
<li>The build has lots of debug options enabled, so don't go benchmarking it</li>
<li>This is FreeBSD-CURRENT on a newly added platform - expect it to blow up in your face and burn holes in your carpet</li>
</ul>

<h1>FreeBSD image for Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>Not scared yet? Fine, grab my prebuilt image:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://ingmar.s3.amazonaws.com/freebsd-pi/bsd-pi-20121030-1814.img.bz2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bsd-pi-20121030-1814.img</a> (01c601537783c179853a71827034f4f7032fdd15)</li>
</ul>

<p>Decompress this and write it to a SD card (at least 1 GB), then plug it in your Raspberry Pi and power it up. The framebuffer works, so after a few seconds you should see boot messages scrolling by and if you have a network cable plugged in you should eventually see a DHCP assigned address.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iVtWx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now you can <strong>ssh</strong> in, using login <strong>root</strong> and password <strong>raspberry</strong>:</p>

"HDD without external power is working. Is this dangerous?","10190","","<p>I have connected a 2,5"" HDD to my Raspberry Pi directly and it works. </p>

<p>The only one question I have - Can my HDD/RPi be damaged? 
(When I use the HDD without powered usb hub - Are there any risks?)</p>
","<p>It probably won't damage the RPi, but it may cause random crashes. Depends on many factors. Power supply, other periperals, cpu load etc.</p>

<p>The main polyfuse is evil. If the current is on the high side it could trip after a few hours even if nothing else changes</p>

<p>I don't power mine through the polyfuse anymore. Much more reliable.</p>

"Disable LAN9512","10180","","<p>The LAN9512 is the hardware device which controls Ethernet and USB ports. This chip consumes almost 200mA, and it will be very useful to disable it to save energy when I don't need USB or Ethernet. The LAN9512 datasheet explains some states of the device to save energy - these modes are SUSPEND2, SUSPEND1 and SUSPEND0. Therefore, it seems to be possible.</p>

<p>I have already found a partial solution:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>echo 0x0 &gt; /sys/devices/platform/bcm2708_usb/buspower</code> will effectively disable the device and wake up it again with <code>echo 0x1</code> to the same file. However, once the device has been stopped and started a certain number of times, it won't wake up again until the next reboot of the operating system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a method to disable LAN9512 and start it again reliably? (Maybe can I reload some driver that controls LAN9512?)  </p>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>

<p>When a raspberry pi model B is idle, it consumes 400 mA. When it's stressed, 470mA. When the LAN9512 is disabled, it consumes 200mA on idle and 260mA stressed.</p>

<p><strong>Others</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have tested the fiability of disabling the chip through ""buspower"" by using a script that disables the LAN9512, tries to mount an usb device to check for activity and reboots. Until now, the raspberry pi has rebooted 9222 times without errors.</li>
<li><code>echo 1 &gt; /sys/devices/platform/bcm2708_usb/bussuspend</code> Disables the LAN9512 But won't wake it up again when doing <code>echo 0</code> to the same file. After disabling it, the raspberry pi goes extremly slow reporting a load average up to 4.</li>
</ul>
","<p>The feature of disabling and enabling LAN9512 trough:</p>

<ul>
<li>echo 0x0 > /sys/devices/platform/bcm2708_usb/buspower (disable)</li>
<li>echo 0x1 > /sys/devices/platform/bcm2708_usb/buspower (enable)</li>
</ul>

<p>Has been debuged on the newer kernels and now is working perfectly without modifications. I have made a couple of scripts to test it.</p>

<p>The purpose of the first one is to test disabling through software feature. The script disables the LAN9512 and tries to mount an USB device. If it can, then the test fail. If not, then the test succeed. Finally reboots and start again. The script has been running for four days and has reported 8039 reboots without failures on raspbian 2013-9-25.</p>

<p>The second script is meant to test the enabling feature. First of all, the script disables the LAN9512. Then waits some seconds to let the pi rest. Next it enables the LAN9512 and finally it tries to execute “lsusb” command. It lists all the USB devices. If the kernel can recognize all the USB devices, then the LAN9512 is working again. If not, the test has failed. The test has been running along a week and reported 7209 loops without errors on raspbian 2013-9-25 and 5374 loops on raspbian 2014-1-7.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fsck.mode=</p>

  <p>fsck.repair=</p>
  
  <p>One of ""preen"", ""yes"", ""no"". Controls the mode of operation. The default is ""preen"", and will

<li><p>Which tool you would use to <del>network</del> capture a network bridge and why? focused on performance? heat built-up? focused on configuration options?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible to capture special ports like ONLY port 80/9100 (more or less) with one of these tools? what would be the best mode to do that? are there options to parse analysed data for keywords/domains/whatever or is this a scenario i have to do after capturing?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible to save each data STREAM directly to a single file? e.g. stream of a captured printer job on 9100? (are there any other sites of SO discussing that kind of questions?)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>kindly</p>
","<p>I would use <code>tcpdump</code> because it is small (self + dependencies). You can specify a <em>capture</em> filter that restricts the capture, for example (assuming interface <code>eth0</code>):</p>

<pre><code>tcpdump -w capture.pcap -i eth0 'tcp port 80 or tcp port 9100'
</code></pre>

<p>If you have wireshark installed, then an alternative command that produces a capture file in a newer format:</p>

<pre><code>dumpcap -w capture.pcapng -i eth0 -f 'tcp port 80 or tcp port 9100'
</code></pre>

<p>A <em>display</em> filter can be used to limit the output of the data (replace <code>wireshark</code> by <code>tshark</code> for textual output instead of a GUI):</p>

<pre><code>wireshark -r capture.pcap -Y 'http.host == example.com'
</code></pre>

<p>For real-time capture you can also combine these options (the filter option can also be specified in the UI so you could omit it from the command if you'd like to):</p>

<pre><code>wireshark -w capture.pcapng -i eth0 -f 'tcp port 80 or tcp port 9100' -Y 'http.host == example.com'
</code></pre>

<p>Then to save a TCP stream, right-click on a packet and pick ""Follow TCP stream"". In the new window, you have the option to save the captured data.</p>

I try to set up an Access-Point. I want to Access my Raspberry Wifi ""Blackbox"". 
After that I want to connect to ""box"" (192.168.100.2) over SSH.

<p>Connecting to Wifi Blackbox works fine. Connecting over SSH to the box, too. Internet on Raspberry also works fine.</p>

<p>When I try to ping Google-Server from the Raspberry, everythink works fine.</p>

<p>When I try to ping the same Server from the box, no Internet Connection is available.</p>

<p>Anyone an idea how to bridge the Internet Connection to the box and maybe also to the connected PC/Laptop/Smartphone ?</p>
","<p>OK. I read your question more carefully and I think I've worked out what's going on. Your bridge and everything is working fine. What's not working is that nothing on the bridge is talking to the internet. Which it can't do because it's not actually connected. On your Pi, two completely separate networks exist. The <code>eth0&lt;-&gt;wlan0</code> network, and the <code>wlan1</code> network to your router. The simple thing to do would be just to glue them together, by changing the interfaces file.</p>

<pre><code>auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp

auto wlan1
iface wlan1 inet dhcp
wpa-conf /etc/wpa.conf

auto br0
iface br0 inet dhcp
bridge_ports eth0 wlan0 wlan1
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, if you actually wanted them to be two separate networks, that's no good. What you want then is to do Network Address Translation (NAT), like your router does to the internet. In which case it's time to enter the land of iptables.</p>

<pre><code>sudo echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan1 -s 192.168.100.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
</code></pre>

<p>What that does is first enable IP forwarding, allowing the Pi to act as a router. The second line is the iptables magic. It tells the kernel networking stack as the final step of the packet routing procedure to bump it up the chain to wlan1 (your net connection), but also to MASQUERADE it. This is to say make it look like it came from this machine and send it on, rather then routing it normally (like bridging would).</p>

<p>The ""box"" will also have to be manually told about the gateway address of the Pi, 192.168.100.1, and you'll have to tell it about some DNS servers. Google's are easy to memorize, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. If the static IP addressing is too much of a bother, look into a package called dnsmasq, which does all of that for you.</p>

"How do I change the IP settings by mounting the SD card in another computer?","10106","","<p>I'm away from a network and unable to use my RPi.
I've got a laptop with a SD card reader, would it be possible to mount the SD card in the laptop and configure the ethernet interface on the Pi with a static IP, then configure the laptop with another static address on the same subnet, then use an ethernet cable between the two so I can then continue to use the RPi via SSH?  What file on the Pi do I need to edit?</p>
","<h1>Avahi</h1>

<p>Yes, if you have a Linux distribution, you can easily mount the SD and change the contents on the SD file system.</p>

<p>As Kibbee wrote, you need to change the content in <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> on the SD-card if you want static IPv4 addresses.  You also need to change the contents in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> on the SD-card as Alex wrote.  As that is also information you get through dynamic addresses.</p>

<p>But a better solution would be to install Avahi on your raspberry instead of setting a static address if you plan to move the Raspberry Pi between networks.  Then the Raspberry will tell Apple computers and other Linux boxes with avahi installed what IP address your Raspberry Pi got. So you can connect without knowing the IP address.</p>

<pre><code>sudo aptitude install avahi-discover avahi-utils avahi-autoipd
</code></pre>

<p>and then you can test this on the other computers</p>

<pre><code>getent hosts raspberrypi.local
avahi-util -a
</code></pre>

<p>or try this</p>

"Raspberry Pi Model B Revision 2, Max USB Output Power","10096","","<p>With the rev. 2 of the Raspberry, the USB protective fuses are removed. </p>

<p>Does this change increase the max current limitation of 100mA per USB? </p>

<p>If not, what does imply the elimination of the fuses? Can the Raspberry be powered through the USB port if the external USB device is powered (i.e., a HDD). </p>
","<p>There is no limitation on USB currrent in rev 2 board other than:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much traces would be able to handle. 2.5A should be safe. </li>
<li>how much current you can get from input. There is a 1.1A polyfuse (with 700mA ""hold current"") on microUSB port. Since RPi itself is using somewhere between 300mA to 550mA, not much is left for USB devices. If you are using other way to power your RPi up, this limitation does not apply. </li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that hotpluging any USB device that takes much current may reboot your RaspberryPi because of voltage drop. So its suggested not to use high current USB devices or plug them before booting. </p>

<p>And yes, you can now (almost) safely power your RPi from USB if your device back feeds power. Keep in mind, however, that USB specification says that devices should not do that (but some USB hubs and probably other devices do not have protection about back feeding power despite what specification says). Since there is no current limit, you should watch out for devices that could give more than 2.5A of power at faulty conditions as this may burn traces on your PCB.</p>

","<p>Changing directory to <code>/pi</code> fails because there is no such directory.  You evidently are confused by the nature of a hierarchical filesystem (a term appropriated by Apple for ""HFS"", but which long pre-dated them and applies to most contemporary filesystems).</p>

<p>Such a filesystem is structured like a tree.  The root is <code>/</code>; there is a further standard for its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard"" rel=""nofollow"">organization on linux</a>; <code>/home</code> is part of that.  </p>

<p>Your CWD is now <code>/home</code>.  If you <code>cd pi</code>, you would be trying to change to <code>/home/pi</code>, since <code>pi</code> is a <em>relative path</em>.

<blockquote>

<p>But you said ""I downloaded the file in /home/Pi/downloads"" -- why would you expect it to be in <code>/home</code>?</p>

<pre><code>cd /home/pi/downloads

<p>These are case sensitive, so be sure that's not <code>Downloads</code>.  Check what is in your CWD with <code>ls</code>.  It should list the file you want to extract.  If not, you are in the wrong place.  You can double check your location with <code>pwd</code> (""present working directory"", same thing as CWD).  When you find it, the tar invocation you have should work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another issue in play here are spaces in filenames.  They're fine, but you have to take them into account.</p>

<pre><code>tar -xvzf TTRLinux v1.2.0.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>There's no way for the interpreter to tell the difference here between two separate arguments, and one with a space in the middle.  If the file really is called ""TTRLinux v1.2.0.tar.gz"", use:</p>

<pre><code>tar -xvzf ""TTRLinux v1.2.0.tar.gz""
  OR 
tar -xvzf TTRLinux\ v1.2.0.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>The first form quotes the argument, making it a single string.  The second uses a character escape sequence (backslash + space) to indicate the space is part of a contiguous string.  Most people will find the first form more intuitive, but the second can be useful in more convoluted circumstances.</p>

<p>Do double check the name to make sure that is a space and not an underscore (<code>TTRLinux_v1.2.0.tar.gz</code>).</p>

","<p>I don't think that should be happening.  There is an <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=82373&amp;p=582328"" rel=""noreferrer"">explanation of the thermometer icon here</a> updated last month, and it says it comes on halfway at 80°C, when the CPU should begin throttling due to overheating.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jGgrE.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jGgrE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Then at 85°C it changes to a full thermometer.  However, that is the <em>maximum recommended operating temperature</em>.</p>

<p>The Pi should not be getting that hot unless you are overclocking it or running it in an unusual environment.</p>

<p>You can get the exact current tempterature with:</p>

<pre><code>vcgencmd measure_temp
</code></pre>

<p>Maxing out all four cores on a Pi 3 for several minutes, I have not seen it go over 60°C.  Admittedly this is without making significant use of the GPU, but I still do not think it should get anywhere close to overheating unless defective or abused.</p>

<p>You could get a heatsink, etc., but it is possible to go far enough down this road <em>to mask the real issue.</em>  I have a couple of defective MCUs (not Pis, fortunately) that when plugged in, immediately begin to heat up until they are too hot to touch, even when they are not being used for anything.  By attaching a heatsink and a fast, 9-12V fan inside a ventilated enclosure, I can keep the temperature stable enough to use them (i.e., so they do burn themselves out -- a normal microchip should not be too hot to touch), but this is <strong>not</strong> how they were intended to be used; the reason I have two is the second one was a replacement from the distributor, who admitted the manufacturer said it should never rise over 45°C.  Which is no where close to ""too hot to touch"".  After the second one turned out the same way I gave up on replacements, they are &lt; $10 items anyway.</p>

<p>Point being, you might be able to ""solve"" the problem by cooling but first you should check how bad the problem is.  Install <code>htop</code> (<code>apt install htop</code>) and run it in a terminal so you can see exactly what your processor core usage is.</p>

<p>Let the pi sit at around idle for a few minutes; with a GUI going and no web browser open, etc., one core or another may constantly blip up halfway, but at least three of them should be at &lt;= 10% usage.  If it is significantly more than this you need to figure that out.</p>

<p>If, after idling for a minute or so, <code>vcgencmd measure_temp</code> command says anything more than 50°C <em>with no heatsink or fan,</em> there is something even more wrong and the Pi may be damaged or defective.</p>

<p>If the thermometer icon comes on but <code>vcgencmd</code> reports a normal operating temperature (really, that shouldn't be more than 45°C at idle), there is probably just a glitch with the GUI.  Apparently it can be disabled by adding:</p>

<pre><code>avoid_warnings=1

"Why do people use powered USB hubs?","9879","","<p>I have the Raspberry Pi B+, and it has four USB ports.</p>

<p>At the moment I am powering an Arduino Mega, a small <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification"" rel=""nofollow"">RFID</a> reader and a keyboard. I plan to also power a Wi-Fi dongle and an <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno"" rel=""nofollow"">Arduino Uno</a>.</p>

<p>Will this just work? I mean it does work. But I was wondering why people use powered USB hubs. I heard some people say Wi-Fi dongles sometimes need a powered USB hub to have good range.</p>

<p>Essentially, what are the advantages of a powered USB hub?
and should I get one for my use situation?</p>
","<p>There are a few factors to consider here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The power input to your Pi is probably through a wall adapter or PSU. You should check the rating of the adapter/PSU. If it is in the range of 1.5A to 2A, then your problem is partially solved.</li>
<li>Next in play, is the polyfuse and regulator on board the Pi. As per specifications on Adafruit, the B+ can handle upto 2A of current. In the model B, this was closer to 1A to 1.2A which was insufficient to power a USB hub, depending on number of devices connected.</li>
<li>Then, come your actual USB devices. The power utilization varies by a lot depending on what you are using. The power usages of some common devices are:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
Wired Keyboards  <b>50 - 150 mA</b>
Wired Mice       <b>Upto 50 mA</b>
Wifi Adapters    <b>100 to 250 mA</b>     (May be even more variable)
Sound Cards      <b>Upto 100 mA</b>
Pi Camera        <b>250 mA </b>
Arduino Uno      <b>30 mA to 500 mA</b>   (The upper limit in this case is due 
                                    to USB 2.0 restrictions)
Arduino Mega     <b>40 mA to 500 mA</b>   (Has a polyfuse that prevents higher 
                                    current draw when powered using USB)
RFID Readers     <b>20 mA and higher</b>  (This can vary a lot depending on technology,
                                    current standards, and operating settings of 
                                    the device)
</pre>

<p>So, you need to know the power characteristics of all your peripherals to estimate whether you need a powered hub or not. If power/current input is greater than power/current requirement, then you do not need a powered hub. </p>

<pre><code>Current Input = Wall Adapter Rating (Max 2A for the B+)
Current Required = Sum of Current Needs of all devices + 700 mA (For the Pi itself)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I have used current and power interchangeably in this post as all USB devices operate at 5V, which is equal to the supply voltage.</p>

<p>If you know the power rating of you device, and do not know the current rating, you can quite easily perform the conversion.</p>

<pre><code>P = V * I
</code></pre>

<p>In the case of USB devices, V will be 5V. So, the current rating becomes:</p>

<pre><code>I = P / 5
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>In your specific case, my estimation would be:</p>

<pre><code>Current Input = 1A to 1.2A  (if you did not purchase a higher rated adapter with the B+)

Current Required = Keyboard + Wifi + Uno + Mega + RFID + Pi
                 = 100 + 100 + 200 + 200 + 20 + 700 (Taking conservative values)
                 = 1320 mA
</code></pre>

<p>So, you will need a powered USB hub (<em>if your power adapter is rated at &lt;1.2A</em>).</p>

<p>What I've discovered via Google and experimentation: The <code>linux</code> package is what brings in <code>mkinitcpio</code> on x86. On the Rpi, the <code>linux</code> package is <code>linux-raspberrypi</code> and this does not have <code>mkinitcpio</code> as a dependency (it was actually explicitly removed <a href=""https://github.com/archlinuxarm/PKGBUILDs/pull/218"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/archlinuxarm/PKGBUILDs/pull/218</a>). I've also read plenty about people on various distros struggling to use an initrd on the Pi so perhaps it doesn't work anyway and that's the reason for mknintcpio not being used.</p>

<p>So, would anyone more knowledgeable care to share their experience with me? Is it possible to boot the Pi with a root partition that is on an LVM volume ?</p>

<p>(I am talking about the root partition here, I am not including the boot partition in this - that's on the sd card and I know that's where it has to be. I put everything else on another hard-drive connected to the usb.)</p>
","<p>This explains how you can boot the Raspberry Pi into a system with the root partition on an LVM volume. LVM is <em>Logical Volume Management</em>.</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>

<p>In order for early-boot to be able to access an LVM volume the kernel
must be able to load the LVM module before the root partition is mounted.
This requires that an initial ramdisk (initrd) is configured and added to
the boot configuration. Fortunately, this is quite straightforward.</p>

<h2>Kernel Support</h2>

<p>To be able to use an initial ramdisk, the kernel must be built with initrd 
support included. The stock Raspberry Pi ArchLinux kernel is. However, to be 
sure, verify this:</p>

<pre><code># zgrep INITRD /proc/config.gz
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
</code></pre>

<p>It is not necessary to build a custom kernel if the <code>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD</code>
option is enabled. Building a custom kernel is beyond the scope of this answer.</p>

<p>In case there is no config.gz in /proc, first run this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo modprobe configs
</code></pre>

<h2>Build the initrd</h2>

<p>Firstly, install the <code>mkinitcpio</code> package:</p>

<pre><code># pacman -S mkinitcpio
</code></pre>

<p>Next, edit <code>/etc/mkinitcpio.conf</code> to add the <code>lvm2</code> hook; locate the <code>HOOKS=</code>
line and amend accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>HOOKS=""base udev autodetect modconf block lvm2 filesystems keyboard fsck""
</code></pre>

<p>Then generate the initrd:</p>

<pre><code># mkinitcpio -g /boot/initrd
</code></pre>

<h2>Amend the boot configuration</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi's boot is configured in two files, <code>/boot/config.txt</code> and
<code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code>. Both need to be modified to install the initrd.</p>

<p>First, add the following line to the end of the `/boot/config.txt' file:</p>

<pre><code>initramfs initrd 0x01f00000
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, unlike the other items in this file, the initramfs entry does not
contain an equals <code>=</code> sign.</p>

<p>Next, amend the <code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code> file to add</p>

<pre><code>...root=/dev/mmcblk0p1 initrd=0x01f00000 rootfstype=ext4...
</code></pre>

<p>Also, append an 'rw' otherwise the rootfs gets mounted read-only.</p>

<h2>Reboot</h2>

<p>With the above configuration in place, re-boot. If all is well, the system should
come back up as before, but will have used the initial ramdisk during boot. The
next step is to move the current root partition onto an LVM volume.</p>

<h1>Move Root partitition to LVM</h1>

<p>For the purpose of this example, we assume that you have a spare disk connected to 
the RPi's USB that is recognised as <code>/dev/sda</code>and has a partition on it for LVM, 
say <code>/dev/sda1</code>. We will copy the existing root partition into a new volume created
inside LVM.</p>

<h2>Set up LVM</h2>

<p>Set up LVM: create a new <em>volume group</em> and, within it, a <em>logical volume</em> for the root
partition:</p>

<pre><code># pvcreate /dev/sda1
# vgcreate storage /dev/sda1
# lvcreate -L 5G storage -n root
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a <em>volume group</em> called <code>storage</code> and adds the partition <code>/dev/sda1</code> to 
it. It creates a 5Gb <em>logical voulume</em> called <code>root</code> which can then be formatted and 
used like a regular partiton:</p>

<pre><code># mkfs.ext4 /dev/storage/root
# mount /dev/storage/root /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>Copy the current root onto it:</p>

<pre><code># rsync --progress -axv / /mnt/
</code></pre>

<h2>Configure the Boot process</h2>

<p>Configuring the boot process is a simple matter of changing the location of the root
partition in <code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code>. Change <code>root=/dev/mmcblk0p1</code> so that it points to
the new volume: <code>root=/dev/storage/root</code>.</p>

<p>Re-boot once more and, if all things go well, the system should reboot with its root
partition on the LVM volume.</p>

"Automatically connect trusted Bluetooth speaker","9858","","<p>I have followed the following tutorial (<a href=""http://mygeeks014.blogspot.nl/2015/01/audio-streaming-to-bluetooth-speaker.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://mygeeks014.blogspot.nl/2015/01/audio-streaming-to-bluetooth-speaker.html</a>) to connect a Bluetooth speaker to my Raspberry Pi. Everything works as it's supposed to, but the speaker will not automatically reconnect when the Raspberry gets restarted or the speaker gets turned on/off. Right now I manually reconnect the speaker via the Raspbian GUI, but I wonder if there's a simple solution to reconnect the speaker via the CLI. I will then be able to write a simple CRON to reconnect the speaker if it's not connected yet. </p>
","<p>Here is a very detail explanation:</p>

<p>Den3243</p>

<p>Here is a command line solution:</p>

<p>First, let's scan, pair, trust your device with 
""bluetoothctl"". To do that, run this at the 
command line, your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>bluetoothctl -a
</code></pre>

<p>You should get a different command prompt
like:</p>

<pre><code>[bluetooth]
</code></pre>

<p>With your BT speaker on, type this:</p>

<pre><code>scan on
</code></pre>

<p>In a few moments, you should see the BT
devices available. Next to the device will be
it's MAC address, like: 00:AA:22:BB:33. Now
type this:</p>

<pre><code>info &lt;your mac address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Exclude the greater than and less than 
characters. What your looking for is some
kind of previous association with your
BT speaker. You will know that there was
a previous association because bluetoothctl
will show information about your BT device.
Some of this information will be about the
device being paired and trusted. This is good.</p>

<p>If bluetoothctl complains about
there is no device, then we need to set that
up at this moment. To do that, type this:</p>

<pre><code>pair &lt;your mac address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You should see a success message about
your device pairing successfully. Now 
let's trust our new BT device. Type this:</p>

<pre><code>trust &lt;your mac address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, you should see a success message
about trusting. Let me pre-warn you. Your
BT device might connect then again it might
not. Never fear, we don't want it to connect.
Go ahead and let's exit ""bluetoothctl"". 
To do that, type:</p>

<pre><code>quit
</code></pre>

<p>Now you will be brought back to the 
command line prompt. In a previous post
I suggested for you to create a scripts 
directory in your home directory. If you
haven't, go ahead and do that now. Type
this at the command prompt:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/scripts
</code></pre>

<p>Press enter and now let's create our
autopair bash script. Type this:</p>

<pre><code>nano ~/scripts/autopair
</code></pre>

<p>Enter this code into the script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
bluetoothctl &lt;&lt; EOF
connect [enter your MAC add]
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>Exclude the brackets!</p>

<p>Now press CTRL + x at the same time, and 
now press enter to save the script. We need
to make it executable. To do that, type this:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x ~/scripts/autopair
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming that you don't use external 
analog speakers plug into the 3.5 mm 
jack. If this is true, let's disable alsa.
To do that, let's edit a file in the /boot
directory called config.txt. To do that,
type this in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Page down to the bottom of the file and
look for two lines that read:</p>

<pre><code># Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
dtparam=audio=on
</code></pre>

<p>Place a (pound sign #) in front of
the line that reads:</p>

<pre><code>dtparam=audio=on
</code></pre>

<p>To look like:</p>

<pre><code>#dtparam=audio=on
</code></pre>

<p>Press CTRL + x and then press Enter
to save your file.</p>

<p>I'm assuming you have pulseaudio installed?
If not, go ahead and run this command from
the command line:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install pulseaudio -y
</code></pre>

<p>This will get you a very important component to 
making bluetooth work! Now let's edit our .bashrc
file in our home directory. Type this:</p>

<pre><code>nano ~/.bashrc
</code></pre>

<p>Page down to the bottom and add this line:</p>

<pre><code>pulseaudio --start
</code></pre>

<p>Press CTRL + x and now press Enter to save
your file.</p>

<p>OK! We need to enter over into the Python
world. I have wrote a Python program that
will watch for the bluetooth device. 
In short, it will activate the connection
between RPi and your bluetooth speaker,
once your bluetooth speaker is turned on.
And vice versa. Let's create a directory
called python in your home directory
To do that, type this:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/python
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's create the python program file.
To do that, type this:</p>

<pre><code>nano ~/python/on.py
</code></pre>

<p>Inside that file, we need to copy and
paste the following:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
#
# Monitor removal of bluetooth reciever
import os
import sys
import subprocess
import time

def blue_it():
    status = subprocess.call('ls /dev/input/event0 2&gt;/dev/null', shell=True)
    while status == 0:
        print(""Bluetooth UP"")
        print(status)
        time.sleep(15)
        status = subprocess.call('ls /dev/input/event0 2&gt;/dev/null', shell=True)
    else:
        waiting()

def waiting():
    subprocess.call('killall -9 pulseaudio', shell=True)
    time.sleep(3)
    subprocess.call('pulseaudio --start', shell=True)
    time.sleep(2)
    status = subprocess.call('ls /dev/input/event0 2&gt;/dev/null', shell=True)  
    while status == 2:
        print(""Bluetooth DOWN"")
        print(status)
        subprocess.call('~/scripts/autopair', shell=True)
        time.sleep(15)
        status = subprocess.call('ls /dev/input/event0 2&gt;/dev/null', shell=True)
    else:
        blue_it() 

blue_it()
</code></pre>

<p>Now press CTRL + x and then press Enter to save
the Python program file. Now we need to make
this file executable. To do that, type this:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x ~/python/on.py
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, let's add this to our .bashrc script
in our home directory:</p>

<pre><code>nano ~/.bashrc
</code></pre>

<p>Page down to the bottom of the file and add these 
two lines:</p>

<pre><code>wait
~/python/on.py
</code></pre>

<p>Now press CTRL + x and then press Enter to save.
Turn your bluetooth speaker on and reboot your
Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Good Luck! </p>

"How to make a Raspberry Pi SD partition accessible from windows and raspbian?","9850","","<p>I'm trying to make a partition on my Raspberry Pi SD card that allows me to access it from a Windows system as well as from linux. How I've to proceed?</p>

<p>For example: On my SD card with 8GB I've 4GB used by the Raspbian partition and i want to create another partition with 4GB where I want to put files with Windows and the SD card conected to the PC (Who appears as a drive connected to the pc) and use this files also with the raspbian system.</p>
","<p>Format the second partition as FAT32 and you're set. Kinda...</p>

<p>You'll probably want to use a large boot partition (first partition). See below.</p>

<p>Windows is weird about partitions on removable media, you may need to use the raspberry's boot partiton as your cross platform partition as the raspberry only boots from the first partition, and Windows will only allow access to the first partition... (unless you hack the disk driver inf file or something like that)</p>

<p>Luckily the boot partition must be FAT32. So windows won't have any problem reading and writing to it. Just be careful not to clobber your boot files...</p>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>I use Arch Linux ARM on my Raspberries, I like the flexibility and ease of install. If you want a Windows compatible partition that just works, try this: 
Boot a Linux live CD or use a Linux system.</p>

<p>Partition the SD Card from a machine like this:
Parition Table: MS-DOS MBR
Partition 1: 1GB FAT32
Partition 2: 7GB(remaining) BTRFS</p>

<p>Download Arch Linux ARM for the Pi
Raspberry Pi:   <a href=""http://archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz</a>

<p>Mount the second partition, create the boot directory, then mount the first partition as the created boot directory.</p>

<p>Then untar the downloaded file to the root of the SD Card's second partition.</p>

<p>Modify the cmdline.txt file like this:</p>

<pre><code>root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait rootfstype=btrfs rootflags=rw,relatime,ssd_spread,space_cache console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 selinux=0 plymouth.enable=0 msc95xx.turbo_mode=N dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 elevator=noop
</code></pre>

<p>Then boot the Pi from the SD Card ans you're set to configure the system from there.</p>

<p>Windows should also auto mount the first partition (this boot partition) and you should be able to read and write files there.</p>

<p><strong>Hub</strong></p>

<p>You are not going to find USB2.0 HUBs that officially supports more then 500mA per port, for the simple reason that 500mA is the maximum power output for a single USB 2.0 port according to the USB 2.0 specifications. In reality however many of the USB Hubs just connect the input power supply to all the output power contacts of the various USB output ports of the hub, meaning that you could dissipate the full power of the Hubs power supply over one port. But for this you need to open the Hub and see if it is constructed like that, if so you can also add a bigger power supply to the Hub itself and dissipate 1A per port without problem, BUT AGAIN: You need to check this on a PER HUB basis!</p>

<li>the connection is reset if another USB device is plugged into the hub, even if the hard disk's connection is untouched.</li>

<p>How can I solve the problem of the hard drive becoming periodically unavailable?</p>
","<p>I finally managed to get a stable setup ( no connection lost for 10 days ). I have given up on the USB hub and the current Raspberry Pi charger.</p>

"How to hook up an AM2302 temperature & humidity sensor several feet away from the Raspberry pi?","9673","","<p>I have a raspberry pi running pipgio and am using the provided code under the python section to get the temperature and humidity reading from the AM2302 (<a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/products/393"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.adafruit.com/products/393</a>). If I connect: Pi &lt;--> breadboard wires &lt;--> AM2302 it will work fine. However that means the sensor has to be 6 inches away from the pi. I really need the sensor about 3 feet away from the pi so it is in a good location to get temperature and humidity. So I connected it like: Pi &lt;--> breadboard wires &lt;--> alarm wire similar gauge to breadboard wires &lt;--> AM2302 and I only get -999 back. In both cases I am connecting to GPIO 17 and using the 3.3 volts to power the sensor.</p>

<pre><code>   3.3V ----- Red wire

 Ground ----- Black wire

GPIO 17 ----- Yellow wire
</code></pre>

<p>So the question is two-fold:</p>

<p><strong>1. Is the alarm wire type causing issues?</strong> If so what is the recommended wire to use for this scenerio?</p>

<p><strong>2. Is using the 3.3v over a longer distance causing the issue?</strong> If so, can I use 5v to solve the issue? The datasheet (<a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/Digital%20humidity%20and%20temperature%20sensor%20AM2302.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/Digital%20humidity%20and%20temperature%20sensor%20AM2302.pdf</a>) says it can accept 3.3 - 5.5v. However, the script says to connect to 5v the below is required but use at your own risk. Is this the best way to connect through 5v? I am not understanding why all that is necessary if the sensor accepts 5v (unless because the pi gpio is not 5v?)</p>

<pre><code>   5V--5K_resistor--+--10K_resistor--Ground

                    |
   DHT22 pin 2 -----+

                    |
   gpio ------------+ 
</code></pre>
","<p>You will almost certainly need to use 5V for any sort of distance.</p>

<p>From an AM2302 pdf (Special instructions of the single bus communication)</p>

<ol>
<li>Typical application circuit recommended in the short cable length of
30 meters on the 5.1K pull-up resistor pull-up resistor according to
the actual situation of lower than 30 m</li>
<li>With 3.3V supply voltage, cable length shall not be greater than
100cm.  Otherwise, the line voltage drop will lead to the sensor
power supply, resulting in measurement error.</li>
<li>Read the sensor minimum time interval for the 2S; read interval is
less than 2S, may cause the temperature and humidity are not allowed
or communication is unsuccessful, etc.</li>
<li>Temperature and humidity values are each read out the results of the
last measurement For real- time data that need continuous read
twice, we recommend repeatedly to read sensors, and each read sensor
interval is greater than 2 seconds to obtain accurate the data.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't know if any of the wires should be twisted for best performance.  The pdf only says to use high quality shielded cable.</p>

<p>When powered from 5V the output pin will be at 5V.  The voltage divider is needed to cut the 5V data output to a Pi gpio safe 3V3.</p>

"Node.js v0.11.14 exits with ""Illegal Instruction""","9613","","<p>I would like to use some of the last features (e.g. generators) of javascript in Node.js, so I download the latest unstable version of Node.js (v0.11.14) and compiled it on my RPi.</p>

<p>But when I try to run it, it throws an <strong>Illegal Instruction</strong> error, except when I run <code>node --version</code> (which answers v0.11.14).</p>

<p>When I installed the stable version of Node (v0.10.32), I didn't have any problem, and I use the same command lines to build it :</p>

<pre><code>./configure --without-snapshot
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>I read <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/raspbian/+bug/1320337"">here</a> that it could be a problem with <strong>libv8</strong> but I'm not sure this is the same problem because this bug is about Node.js v0.10.26.</p>

<p>Does anybody encounter the same issue ?</p>

<p>For information, I'm using Raspbian.</p>
","<p>This is still an unresolved issue with the newest version of Node (as of this writing, v0.12.2)</p>

<p>When browsing Node distributions, the latest ARM build is in v0.11.9, meaning you will currently need to compile from the source, if you want Node.js v0.12.</p>

<p><strong>The following is only related to compiling from source in Raspbian.</strong></p>

<h1>Reason for 'Illegal instruction'</h1>

<p>The V8 Javascript engine used by Node, is issuing ARMv7 CPU instructions, while the Raspberry Pi only understands v6 instructions <em>(note: Raspberry Pi 2 uses an ARM v7 processor)</em></p>

<p>When compiling from source, V8 is compiled as well, and it does not detect and is not told, that the processor is ARMv6, so it is defaulting to ARMv7.</p>

<h1>Test node</h1>

<p>To test whether this is the reason you are experiencing the 'Illegal instruction' error, run
<code>node --v8-options</code>
and look at the second line. If it is:</p>

<pre>
ARMv7=1 VFP3=0 VFP32DREGS=0 NEON=0 SUDIV=0 ...
</pre>

<p>then the <code>ARMv7=1</code> hints that V8 is compiled for ARMv7.</p>

<h1>Raspberry Pi ARM version</h1>

<p>To see which ARM version the processor supports, open <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code></p>

<p>For Raspberry Pi model B (rev. 2), the <em>model name</em> is <code>ARMv6-compatible processor rev 7 (v6l)</code>.</p>

<h1>V8 ARM version detection</h1>

<p>V8 tries to detect which ARM version to use, but in this case, it does not get it right. The detection happens in <code>deps/v8/src/base/cpu.cc</code> (tip: search for <code>v6l</code> - lowercase L). The area of interest is:</p>

<pre>
// Unfortunately, it seems that certain ARMv6-based CPUs
// report an incorrect architecture number of 7!
//
// ...
//
// We try to correct this by looking at the 'elf_format'
// field reported by the 'Processor' field, which is of the
// form of ""(v7l)"" for an ARMv7-based CPU, and ""(v6l)"" for
// an ARMv6-one. For example, the Raspberry Pi is one popular
// ARMv6 device that reports architecture 7.
if (architecture_ == 7) {
  char* processor = cpu_info.ExtractField(""Processor"");
  if (HasListItem(processor, ""(v6l)"")) {
    architecture_ = 6;
  }
  delete[] processor;
}
</pre>

<p>( See also <a href=""https://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/base/cpu.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">V8 cpu.cc</a> )</p>

<p>Even though it tries to detect the <code>v6l</code> string in <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>, it is looking at the <em>Processor</em> field - but the info is in the <em>model name</em> field - as stated in the <em>Raspberry Pi ARM version</em> section of this post.</p>

<h1>Node configure script</h1>

<p>The configure script for Node also needs to be edited.</p>

<p>The code is:</p>

<pre>
  if is_arch_armv7():
    o['variables']['arm_version'] = '7'
  elif is_arch_armv6():
    o['variables']['arm_version'] = '6'
  else:
    o['variables']['arm_version'] = 'default'

  o['variables']['arm_fpu'] = 'vfpv3'  # V8 3.18 no longer supports VFP2.
  o['variables']['arm_neon'] = int(is_arm_neon())
  o['variables']['arm_thumb'] = 0      # -marm

"How do I get RCA video out of OpenELEC?","9610","","<p>Thanks to help received in here, I was able to get RCA video out of my Raspberry Pi 1 version B with NOOBS.</p>

<p>With Raspian (installed via NOOBS) all I had to do was editing the config.txt file to comment out <code>hdmi_force_hotplug=1</code> and uncomment <code>sdtv_mode=2</code> lines. All is fine and dandy. After that, Raspian was able to show the desktop on TV.</p>

<p>Now, OpenELEC with Kodi is a different beast. I was able to log in via SSH to modify both config.txt files (the one in boot and the one in boot-rp1) to reflect the same changes as above but...</p>

<p>No video output at all. I get a slight flicker at boot, I can hear sound but... the screen is dark.
Even if I add <code>hdmi_ignore_hotplug=1</code>.
I though I verified the files have been changed (even the one that can be seen from the recovery menu of Noobs reflects such changes).</p>

<p>But...where is the right config.txt for OpenELEC?
There is one each in</p>

<ul>
<li>/var/media/boot</li>
<li>/var/media/boot-rp1</li>
<li>/flash/boot</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two I was able to modify via SSH to carry the following lines (I also made sure there were no conflicting directives after them).</p>

<pre><code># hdmi_force_hotplug=1
hdmi_ignore_hotplug=1
sdtv_mode=2
</code></pre>

<p>But the one in /flash/boot/ is still carrying <code>hdmi_force_hotplug=1</code> and has the <code>sdtv_mode=2</code> commented out. So I guess that's the one I should be modifying. But if I try nano complains the file system is write only. 
Should I change permission for the whole directory, first, or are there more hoops I should be jumping into?</p>

<p>Why should I be jumping through all these hoops?
Shouldn't NOOBS be avoiding this by allowing simple switching between devices?</p>

<p>EDITed to remove the long config.txt file, since the problem seems to be elsewhere now. (file can still be seen in the edit history).</p>
","<p>For future reference.</p>

<p>OpenELEC config.txt file is in /flash</p>

<p>To modify it, you need to remount the /flash directory as rw, as it is read-only by default. The easiest way to do that is to have both the Pi and another computer on the same network and use SSH.</p>

<p>If you are using Windows, you can use PuTTY: launch the exe, put the IP address of your Pi (you can read it in the network connections page of your router, or in the System>System Info page of OpenELEC), let's say it's 192.168.0.3. Click on connect in Putty's window and you will be presented with a console. </p>

<p>Enter <code>root</code> as user, and <code>openelec</code> as password.
You will be presented with a console-like window.</p>

<p>Now, remount /flash as read-write</p>

<pre><code>mount -o remount,rw /flash
</code></pre>

<p>and launch nano to edit your config.txt file</p>

<pre><code>nano /flash/config.txt 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to make your OpenELEC switch to PAL when there is no HDMI cable connected to your Pi, I suggest you modify the last lines to show</p>

<pre><code># hdmi_force_hotplug=1
# hdmi_ignore_hotplug=1
sdtv_mode=2
</code></pre>

<p>The first one needs to be commented out so that the Pi won't always force HDMI output. The second one I like it to have it commented out (or not there at all) so that the Pi won't always force composite video output, regarless of the presence of an HDMI cable plugged in.
The third line tells the Pi to use PAL video output.</p>

<p>Once your are done modifying config.txt, press CTRL+x to exit, then Y to confirm you want to save the changes and ENTER to overwrite the config.txt file.</p>

<p>We're almost done: all we have to do now is to make /flash read-only again.</p>

<pre><code>mount -o remount,ro /flash
</code></pre>

<p>and then we can reboot</p>

<pre><code>reboot  
</code></pre>

<p>Close Putty's window and enjoy your OpenELEC on an HDMI TV when the HDMI cable is plugged in or on your old analog TV when there is no HDMI cable in and you have you TV hooked up via the yellow RCA connector. Audio signal will have to be tapped from the 3.5mm jack connector.</p>

<p>And you are hopefully done jumping through hoops.</p>

"Gertboard & pi-face, what are the major differences, and what could you use them for?","9593","","<p>I haven't tracked down a lot of information on this on the web, and the previous notable difference of the Gertboard being DIY no longer holds.</p>

<p>The kind of answers I'm looking for: <em>""If you want to do x, y, z, you should go for [Gertboard|Pi-Face]...""</em>, and <em>""If you know how to a, b, c, you're better off choosing the [Gertboard|Pi-Face]""</em></p>

<p>Go easy, I'm not a hardware expert...</p>

<p>(Apparently pi-face tag doesn't exist?)</p>

<p>(<a href=""http://piregistration.element14.com/signup.html?COM=e14_RaspberryPiAccessories"">Element14</a>, <a href=""http://www.tech-fruits.com/archives/6042"">Gertboard</a>, <a href=""http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/interface.htm"">Pi-Face</a>)</p>
","<p>If I compare the schematics of the two boards the first thing that I see is that the PiFace <a href=""http://piface.openlx.org.uk/kernel-driver-delays-and-new-interface-board"">(schematic)</a> is a much less complicated board then the Gertboard <a href=""http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1642649.pdf"">(Schematic on the last pages)</a>. </p>

<p><strong>PiFace</strong></p>

<p>The PiFace is actually an I/O extender that uses the SPI bus to extend the I/O capabilities of the RPi with 8 extra input and 8 extra output pins. While all 8 input and 8 ouput capabilities are routed to pins for external connection, some have a double function. 2 of the 8 output pins are used to drive a couple of Relays, and 4 of the 8 input pins are fitted with buttons on the board itself. Further the input pins are directly connected to the I/O extension IC, there is no protection for over voltage in these circuits. The 8 output pins are driven by a <a href=""http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/DATASHEET/CD00000179.pdf"">ULN2801A</a>, this means that each output pin can drive up to 500mA (externally supplied) at a maximum of 50V. </p>

<p>In theory you could connect 4 PiFace boards to the RPi, because the address of the SPI I/O extension chip (<a href=""http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21952b.pdf"">MCP23S17SP</a>) can be set using 2 jumpers. In reality this will be very hard to achieve because the PiFace is a board that needs to be stacked on top of the RPi and the main connector (the one on the bottom that connects to the GPIO pins on the RPi) is not fitted with a female counter part on the top to enable stacking more boards. I guess they did not do that because the Relays are too high anyway to enable stacking.</p>

<p>Further all the I/O is in a fixed setup, the board is AS IS and you cannot change it in any way. </p>

<p><strong>GertBoard</strong></p>

<p>The Gertboard on the other hand isn't fixed in any way, when you just connect it to the RPi, nothing (??) will work because nothing is actually connected to the GPIO pins. You need to use the scratch pad to manually make the connections to the desired parts of the board. This is done by using wires with a little connector on both ends. The number of options on this board are higher, but you cannot use everything together at the same time (??), so you will have to rewire the scratchpad when a different function is required.</p>

<p>It can also provide extra input and output (Low voltage TTL) pins to use externally, these can be configured for input or output individually, there are 12 of these available and these are buffered (input and output) and the first 3 are fitted with onboard buttons.</p>

<p>It also features 'power' outputs similar to the PiFace board, 6 of these are available, they can also provide a 500mA at a maximum of 50V (externally supplied)</p>

<p>Further is has Analog/Digital conversion, and Digital/Analog conversion, a motor driver that can power brushless motors (servos/stepper motors etc). It even has a separate AVR microcontroller which can be programmed from the RPi to perform separate tasks, independent of the RPi.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Back to your question and the way you wanted it answered, to give a set of general rules the way you asked for is nearly impossible. The only useful thing I can comment in the 'if .. then ..' style is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to experiment with various types of input and output, the Gertboard is the one to go, it features much more options,</li>
<li>If you need just some extra input and outputs without the hassle of using a scratchpad, the PiFace is the way to go.</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot compare both very well, for example I would never use the Gertboard in a product, I could however use the Gertboard for tests and use parts of it in a separate design to be used in a product. The PiFace could be used in a product if you just need some extra input and output contacts.</p>

<p>Within a learning context: The PiFace could be featured in the first lessons to get some basic feeling for input and output and how to handle those from the RPi, the Gertboard could be introduced after that for more advanced tasks.</p>

"using a SSH and can't login on my raspberry","9543","","<p>I'm on a Mac and using Ethernet through a thunderbolt adapter. I use Raspbian Debian Wheezy 2014-09-09. I'm using VirtualBox (program) for school, and Cyberduck to setup the SSH connection. I'm supposed to use this method:</p>

Okay, so I followed a PDF from my school to set up a virtual machine. The program to make this is Virtualbox. That virtual machine runs on Debian.

I needed to shut off my ethernet cables ipv4 automatic configure and give the raspberry the ip address: 192.168.1.1. I did that with the code </p>

<p><code>root@debianrouter:~# ssh -l pi 192.168.1.1</code></p>

<p><code>root@debianrouter:~# ssh -v pi 192.168.1.1</code></p>

<p>and that's where I'm stuck, I don't know what to do. I expect to just write:</p>

Everything above is done on the Virtual machine.</p>
","<p>The problem here is that the LAN connection can retrieve an IP Address (192.168.1.1). You have to turn IPv4 off in settings (for@jrust, check iArch_week3 @87) , so the virtual machine gives the Raspberry its own IP, in our case 192.168.1.100.</p>

  <p><strong>upgrade</strong> is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version. An update must be performed first so that apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.</p>
  
  <p><strong>dist-upgrade</strong> in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt-get has a ""smart"" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade command may remove some packages. The <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual packages.

<p>I'm a Windows user so be nice. :)</p>
","<p>There are two common ways to use BT (and often USB) devices for network. PAN/NAP (looks something like an ethernet chip) and modem emulation. NAP ought to be better, but it seems to be easier to use the modem.</p>

<p>A full-blown desktoppy way these days would probably to use <a href=""http://wiki.debian.org/NetworkManager"" rel=""nofollow"">networkmanager</a> and <a href=""http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=modemmanager"" rel=""nofollow"">modemmanager</a> and the matching GUI bits.</p>

<p>Without all that, I've found <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wvdial"" rel=""nofollow"">wvdial</a> makes it easy to dial 3G modems.</p>

<p>There should be a way to connect to BT NAP by commands alone. I don't know/remember how that works (but see links below).</p>

<p>Getting to the modem (emulation), I believe you use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_protocols#Radio_frequency_communication_.28RFCOMM.29"" rel=""nofollow"">rfcomm</a> to open a ""serial port"" to the phone. Then just use that device as a modem.</p>

<p>How you select between networks (3G/4G/wifi) etc. depends on your phone and phone settings. You may need the APN from your service provider's instructions in the PI's settings but shouldn't need to enter the PIN. The phone number dialed usually selects a profile from your phone's settings to use.</p>

<p>Either way, you'll of course need to connect/pair the phone and the computer succesfully. I think that's <a href=""http://wiki.debian.org/BluetoothUser"" rel=""nofollow"">the place to start</a>. :)</p>

<pre><code>Match User !root
    PasswordAuthentication no
</code></pre>

<p>And then you add a new user with limited permissions.Always log in as that user and when you need to do something as root you can just use <code>sudo ""command""</code> - enter the root password and it will do it and come back to your low privilege user.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To elevate into a root console from low privilege just type <code>sudo</code> enter your password. Once you are done type <code>exit</code> and you will drop back to the low privilege user.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I already say that removing root user password and ssh key login is a very bad idea on a device that will be publicly available. Never do this on a public device! </p></li>

<p>My <em>understanding</em> of open source hardware is that <em>every</em> single hardware component on it has to be open source in order for the unit as a whole to be OSH. But if ARM is proprietary, then how can RPi be OSH?!?</p>
","<p>Raspberry Pi has never maintained that the Pi is open source. There are many parts of it, especially the software, which <em>are</em> open source, but not everything is. There has been criticism of the Pi for having parts which are closed source, however given that the aim of the Pi is education of children, open sourcing everything is not seen as a priority.</p>

"DS18B20 temperature sensor not registered - debugging?","9368","","<p>Like other posters I have connected the temperature sensor (from ModMyPi Hacker Kit) a variety of ways and can not get my Raspberry Pi 2 to recognise it. I have unsuccessfully followed posts to diagnose on:</p>

<p>I see 0 devices found.</p>

<p>All the posts assume that the end user will find the device and there is no debugging assistance. As a new Raspberry Pi owner and novice, how do I go about debugging to find where the issue is i.e. is it the temperature sensor that I have fried or is it the w1 bus that is faulty, or even a bad breadboard?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 18/02/2015 # 1</strong>
<strong>SOLVED</strong>.<br>
I swapped all wires and the sensor now works. Must have been a combination of Device Tree, Raspian, firmware, and bad wires.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 18/02/2015</strong>
Updated Raspian (3.18.7-v7+ #756) 
Updated firmware. Still no joy. </p>

Still no luck I'm afraid. I have edited the <code>/boot/config.txt</code> as per @Geerlingguy. I now have devices listed in <code>/sys/bus/w1/devices</code>, but they don't look substantial. Running cat w1_slave in any of the subsequent directories fails. I suspect this is also because something is missing after the Device Tree firmware update. See the latest image below:</p>

<p>It is possible that other such cables exist and they do have Linux applications that can be run on <code>ARM</code> architecture but I doubt it.</p>

<p>It would also be possible to do similar cable in more system agnostic way - the cable could be implemented in a way that it is seen as a USB Ethernet card on both sides. I don't know it such cables exists, though.</p>

<p>I have attached an image of how the circuit is wired.<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vKRvf.png"" alt=""LEDciruit""></p>
","<p>The wiring looks correct for the code.</p>

<p>The problem is that the code is in a very tight loop. In theory, when the button is pressed, the loop body repeatedly turns the LED on and off. In theory, there would be a 50/50 chance the LED is left on (or off) when the button is released. Do you notice a change in brightness when the button is pressed. There might not be enough to be noticed.</p>

<p>In practice, the reason for the tendency to leave the LED on is the way you test to see if it already is on. Writing pin 0 HIGH applies 3.3 V to the output. But that wire is connected to the LED and the pin configured to be an output. The LED may be dropping the voltage low enough to not register as HIGH when it is read, but sometimes it does because it is near the cutoff.</p>

<p>In practice, code to turn the LED off and on with each button press would use a falling-edge-triggered interrupt. As pointed out in the comments, you would want to debounce the interrupt in that case. You could also do the same thing without interrupts by recording the previous state of the button and only changing the LED when the button state had changed. Debouncing as the code is written now makes no sense.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;wiringPi.h&gt;
int main (void)
{
    wiringPiSetup ();
    pinMode (0, OUTPUT);
    pinMode (1, INPUT);
    digitalWrite (0, LOW);

    int prevButton = HIGH, LED = 0;

    for(;;)
    {
        if(prevButton == HIGH &amp;&amp; digitalRead(1) == LOW)  // a falling edge
        {
            prevButton = LOW;

            if(LED)
            {
                LED = 0;
                digitalWrite(0, LOW);
            }
            else
            {
                LED = 1;
                digitalWrite(0, HIGH);
            }
        }
        else if(prevButton == LOW &amp;&amp; digitalRead(1) == HIGH)  // a rising edge, do nothing
        {
            prevButton = HIGH;

<p>I want to use the Raspberry Pi as the R36: No Ethernet cable, just two USB WiFi adapters; one to receive the signal and the other one to send it on. How do I enable this?</p>
","<p>You can configure the RPi as a bridge, including between 2 USB wifi interfaces, wired interfaces or any combination. Be aware, though, that most of the USB ""nano"" type wifi adapters don't perform at what you might expect from the packaging. I tested Edimax, TP-Link and generic adapters on a desktop PC, and none would connect at any higher than 54 Mbps in the same room as my wifi router, including the ""n"" compatible versions. The generic was limited to 35 or so Mbps. </p>

<p>The RPi 2B itself can bridge traffic at over 100 Mbps without a problem, despite the limitations of the USB-Ethernet controller. The cheap wifi adapters are the limitation. Using 2 wifi adapters, I couldn't get more than 10 Mbps of throughput. If this is sufficient, or if you're willing to buy adapters that cost more than the RPi itself, along with the appropriate antennas, you might be able to do this satisfactorily. </p>

<p>I am not sure if the device shown in the window on your drawing is just an external antenna, or a wireless-wired bridge. In any case, I'd expect to have to use some external antennas to get it to work unless that outdoor antenna is located very near to your house. So while you might be able to get a RPi to work, there may be special-purpose devices out there that will cost less in the end to get working.</p>

  <p>RPi.GPIO provides a built-in function
  GPIO.cleanup() to clean up all the ports you’ve used. But be very
  clear what this does. It only affects any ports you have set in the
  current program. It resets any ports you have used in this program
  back to input mode. This prevents damage from, say, a situation where
  you have a port set HIGH as an output and you accidentally connect it
  to GND (LOW), which would short-circuit the port and possibly fry it.
  Inputs can handle either 0V (LOW) or 3.3V (HIGH), so it’s safer to
  leave ports as inputs.</p>

"SD card write speed seems to be 14 times slower than read speed","9192","","<p>I was writing to an SD card this evening from a Mac Book Air internal card reader, and the performance reported was 1.4&nbsp;MB/sec. I later <em>read</em> tested it on the Raspberry Pi and got 20&nbsp;MB/sec. It is a class 6 card and neither of these figures sound realistic!</p>

<p>I am using <code>dd</code> for my tests. Results of identical tests of both read and write on both computers:</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi:    Read 20&nbsp;MB/sec. &nbsp;Write  11&nbsp;MB/sec... <br/>

<p>Read test:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dd of=/dev/null if=/dev/mmcblk0p3 bs=1M count=400

<p>This indicates that the perceived anomaly was in fact lousy performance of the integrated Mac Book Air SD card reader! It makes for very slow image creation.</p>
","<p>SD card speed class rating specifies <strong>minimal</strong> read/write performance the card should have while recording video. Class number is the lower speed limit in MB/s you should get when using the card.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that reading from card is usually much simpler (and thus faster) than writing. This is why usual class 6 card will have 6MB/s write speed by 15-20 MB/s read speed (but only 6MB/s is warranted).</p>

<p>Speed of reading/writing can be limited not only by a card but also by a lot of different factors, both hardware and software. Especially it can be limited by some problems with card reader/writer.</p>

<p>So in your situation, it seems that your card has really bad performance on your Mac Book Air while it has proper (and realistic) performance on RaspberryPi. We can't be sure, however, since you tested <strong>write</strong> speed on Mac Book and <strong>read</strong> speed on RaspberryPi and as I mentioned earlier, they are not comparable. It's also hard to comment on why you're getting such results since you didn't specify how are you testing those speeds.</p>

"How do I fix cracking sounds?","9134","","<p>I have installed RetroPie in my B+, but when I play a game, the sound cracks. I have connect my speakers using 3,5 mm jack.</p>
","<p>There are three solutions for this:</p>

<h2>Solution 1</h2>

<p>Make sure your Pi is getting enough power. This is the most common problem with Raspberry Pi's, because they don't come with a standardized power supply. Just make sure you are using a <strong>thick and short</strong> cord, and not a thin and long one like phone charging cords.</p>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>

<p>Pulseaudio. Pulseaudio is a package for the RPi that significantly increases the quality of the audio. Follow <a href=""https://dbader.org/blog/crackle-free-audio-on-the-raspberry-pi-with-mpd-and-pulseaudio"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2>Solution 3</h2>

<p>Buy an external USB sound card. This is what I do, just because I needed to record things and the RPi's audio jack is not capable of input. I use <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00M3UWE3Q"" rel=""nofollow"">this card</a>, it is very cheap at $3 and the quality exactly the same as the audio port on my Macbook.</p>

","<p>Apparently, <a href=""https://build.nethunter.com/rpi3-nexmon/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kali Linux 0.6 Raspberry Pi 3 w/ Nexmon</a> contains older packages. Once issuing the command <code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get -y upgrade &amp;&amp; apt-get -y dist-upgrade</code> <code>tightvncserver</code> gets replaced by <code>tigervncserver</code>. Thus, <code>TightVNC</code> isn't part of the official Kali Linux repositories anymore. <code>TigerVNC</code> is a fork that is supported by the standard Kali Linux repositories.</p>

<p>I managed to figure out a pretty good alternative to <code>TightVNC</code> and <code>TigerVNC</code>. Below is my expanded solution.</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>I would recommend using <code>x11vnc</code> as it provides the actual desktop experience rather than a virtual one. </p>

<p>To install <code>x11vnc</code> enter the following command:</p>

<p><code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y x11vnc</code></p>

<p>If you experience that the <code>framebuffer</code> size is too small, then to change it by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Locate <code>/boot/config.txt</code> and open it using <code>nano</code> or <code>vim</code></li>
</ol>

<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: If the file <code>/boot/config.txt</code> does not exist, safely power-off the Pi using the command, <code>poweroff</code> and take the Micro-SD card out and plug it into a laptop or desktop computer. When the Micro-SD card mounts, open it. The <code>config.txt</code> file should be on the root of the mounted Micro-SD card).</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>uncomment the following text in <code>config.txt</code>: </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Before</em>:</p>

<p><code>#framebuffer_width=1280</code></p>

<p><code>#framebuffer_height=720</code></p>

<p><em>After</em>:</p>

<p><code>framebuffer_width=1280</code></p>

<p><code>framebuffer_height=720</code></p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Save and exit the file. Then, reboot the Pi and start <code>x11vnc</code> by using the following command to push it into a background process: <code>x11vnc -usepw -reopen -bg -forever &amp;</code></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>If you would like to start <code>x11vnc</code> at boot, add the following to a file called <code>x11vnc.desktop</code> in <code>~/.config/autostart</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=x11vnc
Exec=x11vnc -usepw -reopen -bg -forever &amp;
Comment=Starts an x11vnc server on port kali:5900

<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: If <code>~/.config/autostart</code> does not exist, create the <code>autostart</code> directory by issuing the following command: <code>mkdir ~/.config/autostart</code>). </p>

"Launching vino-server on display :0 at boot","8970","","<p>I run my Raspberry Pi with <code>Raspbian</code> with an <code>X</code> server running but without a monitor connected to it. I installed <code>tightvncserver</code> and now running:</p>

<pre><code>vncserver :1 -geometry 1600x900 -depth 24
</code></pre>

<p>I can have a <code>lightdm</code> desktop session to connect to.</p>

<p>However, in this way, a totally new <code>lightdm</code> desktop session is created. This session is different from the one I see on my TV and that eats up another 20 megs of RAM. Obviously, this is not the best solution that can be achieved.</p>

<p>So I installed <code>vino</code>: I've already used it in Ubuntu with almost no problems at all. However, on <code>Raspbian</code>, I'm facing a weird problem when trying to have it launched after the first <code>lightdm</code> login. Given that <code>Desktop Session Settings</code> doesn't allow to add new entries via its graphical interface, I created a <code>vino-server.desktop</code> launcher (that calls <code>/usr/lib/vino/vino-server</code>) and I moved it to <code>/etc/xdg/autostart/</code>. This method also used to work in <code>Knoppix</code>, so I was somewhat confident. In fact, within <code>Desktop Session Settings</code> the new launcher was present and enabled.</p>

<p>After a reboot, no <code>/usr/lib/vino/vino-server</code> process was running. However, I know that the procedure is almost correct, because if I launch another <code>vncserver</code> session, I can see a <code>vino-server</code> process popping up inside the process list.</p>

<p>So the question is: what am I doing wrong? Why does this method work for any other <code>lightdm</code> session except the main one?</p>
","<p>Finally I've made it! The procedure was almost correct. I was just missing a few little details.</p>

<p>First, the timings: putting <code>/usr/lib/vino/vino-server</code> directly in <code>lightdm</code> autostart launched it before the <code>X</code> session was completely set-up. So I wrapped it into a script with a little bit of delay before the command:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

sleep 5
/usr/lib/vino/vino-server &amp;

"Is a super computer built from many RPis really practical or just a novelty?","8941","","<p>This question is inspired by <a href=""http://archive.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2012-09-12/supercomputer_gets_built_using_rasberry_pi_computers_and_lego.html"">this article</a>.</p>

<p>Currently I spend a lot of time in R to analyze data.  Some of the scripts I run in R could benefit from parallel computing in order to save time.  Let's say I could build a barebones ""real"" computer for maybe ~$300 and for that same $300 I could get 6 Pis (including power cable and SD card).  Assuming I had a task that was well suited for parallelization would I be better with the Pis or the ""real"" computer?</p>

<p>Would the answer change if I ramp up the ""real"" computer's hardware to something that may cost $1000 how would that fare against 20 Pis?</p>
","<p>If you want to analyse this, you have to step beyond saying 20 rpis vs. $1000 and decide for yourself what <em>you</em> can actually get and use for $1000.  <strong>Note that this is not the shopping channel.</strong></p>

<p>Let's say you can get a motherboard, power supply, 8 GB ram, a 6-core 3.4 Ghz i7 processor, and some old hard drive (still faster than an SD card!) for ~$1000.  The total cycles per second would be 6 * 3.4e9 = 20.4e9, vs. 20 * 0.7e9 = 14e9 for the pi supercomputer.</p>

<p>Now consider the fact that a multi-core processor is a multi-core processor, whereas the I/O betwixt pis (if this becomes a significant factor) is going to be orders of magnitude slower.</p>

<p>While I don't have a serious interest in (or knowledge of) pi supercomputers, I would assume they are for experimentation and educational purposes.  It's definitely a cheap cluster, but if your goal is to crunch numbers fast (as opposed to experimenting and educating), there's <em>no way</em> a pi cluster it is going to be more cost or energy effective than a normal PC.  </p>

"Kernel .config necessary options","8932","","<p>I'm interested in compiling a custom kernel for the pi.  I have the source from <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tree/rpi-4.0.y"">the github archive</a>, which includes a make target for a default configuration:</p>

<pre><code>make ARCH=arm bcmrpi_defconfig
</code></pre>

<p>But (as with normal linux distro kernels) this includes a lot of stuff I will never need, and some things that I'd like to change.</p>

<p>What are the options that are actually <em>required</em> to make various common pi-centric things work?</p>
","<p>Starting with the default configuration, or one you know works already, is a good idea.  Beware that <strong>for the Pi 2</strong>, you should use:</p>

<pre><code>make bcm2709_defconfig
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of <code>bcmrpi_defconfig</code>.</p>

<p>Note that if you want to avoid clobbering an existing kernel install of the same version, set the <em>General setup -> Local version - append to kernel release</em> string to a unique value.</p>

<p>I've used the actual labels from <code>.config</code> here, sans <strong>CONFIG_</strong>; if you are using e.g., <code>make menuconfig</code>, you can find the relevant option with the search (forward slash <kbd>/</kbd>).  These labels are also used at the top of the ""Help"" page for each option.  Note that the term <em>enable(d)</em> refers to something which causes an option to appear, distinct from actually <em>selecting</em> the option to be built.</p>

<p>Where there are differences between the A/B/B+/A+ boards and the Pi 2, this is indicated.  In some places this is the difference between the Broadcom 2708 and 2709 families, but in other places, the Pi 2 uses the same 2708 (or 2835) option as the other boards.</p>

<li><strong>SENSORS_BCM2835</strong> (Device Drivers->Hardware Monitoring support->Broadcom BCM2835 HWMON Driver).  This is at the bottom of the list <em>if</em> you don't select ""BCM2835 Thermal Driver"", below.  It gives you access to thermal stuff in <code>/sys/devices/platform/bcm2835_hwmon</code> -- <code>temp1_input</code> and <code>temp1_max</code>.  The former is the same <code>/sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp</code>; the latter is always 85000 (i.e. 85 °C).</li>
<li><strong>THERMAL_BCM2835</strong> (Device Drivers->Generic Thermal sysfs driver->BCM2835 Thermal Driver).  Also choose Device Drivers->Hardware Monitoring support (but not the individual driver in that menu) so that ""Expose thermal sensors as hwmon device"" appears here and you can choose that (4.0.y seems to not have this). Choosing this will unchoose SENSORS_BCM2835, above.  It gives you access to the easier to remember and find <code>/sys/class/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0</code> which includes <code>temp</code> and <code>trip_point_0_temp</code> (the same as <code>temp1_max</code>, above).

"Raspberry Pi cluster running as gaming server (TF2 modded minecraft)","8913","","<p>I am new to raspberry pi and I am keen to play with its capabilities. I am a keen gamer as well and would like to see if I could link the two. I have been reading up on raspberry clusters and I would like to make a cluster of my own and run some gaming servers on it for example modded minecraft (heavily modded) and a team fortress 2 server (just a dream). I have a rough idea of what is required to cluster pi's I would just like some advice and guidance on whether it is possible and what I should look out for.</p>
","<p>I was thinking about something similiar but being done with spare motherboards in my house.</p>

<p><strong>Clusters don't work like normal PCs. A cluster of slow computers is not the same as one fast.</strong> Clusters are designed to run cluster-targeted software. This software is coded to divide similiar parts of work to be done onto smaller pieces ready to be executed paralelly (at the same time). I am not sure if there is any cluster-targeted minecraft of TF2 server software.</p>

<p><strong>Most of the software available for Minecraft servers isn't low-RAM optimized</strong></p>

<p>I don't know about TF2 servers because im a Minecraft server specialist.</p>

<p><em>Let's say you have a cluster of Pi's (or any other computers).</em>
Now, if you run a Minecraft server (= a process) which is not designed to run on cluster, <strong>Linux will execute this process on the core ( = raspi) it likes</strong> and the rest of pi's would be idle or doing something else. Also, <strong>a modded Minecraft server hardly goes on 2GB RAM</strong>, and one B+ pi has only 512MB. I have a pc with 2GB ram and the Bukkit server eats it all up.</p>

<p><strong>TL-DR/Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p><em>16 x 512MHz PC cluster is not the same as 8GHz PC</em></p>

<p>You can make yourself a cluster, but it would be useless without software to run on a cluster (I don't mean the software controlling the cluster).</p>

<p>Note: The hosting companies for Minecraft servers use clusters, but their clusters are made of fast PCs and they run multiple server instances.</p>

"Is there a way to Stop/Pause an actively recording/on raspi camera?","8912","","<p>Starting the <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/camera"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raspi Camera</a> is rather trivial:</p>

<pre><code>raspivid -t 10000 -o test.h264
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>There is no way to stop this. This seems really stupid to me as, to the best of my knowledge, there is no camera available for retail which requires the user to specify how many seconds to run for, and then runs for that many seconds before stopping. </p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>This presents a huge problem in surveillance. I am creating a program where home surveillance is switched on when the user leaves, and then off again when they return. If motion is detected just before the user returns, the camera starts recording for a predetermined period of time (ie. 10 mins), but since the <code>raspivid</code> command is blocking, I get a situation where the user is physically in the house, but the program is in the <code>surveillance</code> state. To get around this, I launch a thread to launch the <code>raspivid</code> command, so now the states are correctly updated based on when the user comes and goes. However, now other states don't work. For example, I can't switch to the <code>TV</code> state as I can not record HD footage and watch it at the same time. Similarly, I can't switch to the <code>Party</code> state (constant video recording of parties) as the camera is already recording.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Solution:</strong></p>

<p>Using code I found on the web (but can't find the link to any more), I found a hack whereby I kill the thread which launched the <code>raspivid</code> command. Unfortunately this is considered blasphemy by SO (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/323972/is-there-any-way-to-kill-a-thread-in-python"">here</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6524459/stopping-a-thread-python"">here</a>), which I agree with not only because it might corrupt the <code>.h264</code> files and lead to memory leaks, but also because it is a nightmare for me to code (I have to have locks and semaphores everywhere as I am launching other threads for motion detection as well).</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>Is there any way to stop a recording raspi camera? If not, why not?</p>
","<p>Inspecting the source code to <code>Raspivid</code> reveals that there are two ways to interrupt the capture.</p>

<p>The first method is to send any SIGNAL to the capture process.  The signal is processed by the following code in <code>Raspivid</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    /**
     * Handler for sigint signals
     *
     * @param signal_number ID of incoming signal.
     *
     */
    static void signal_handler(int signal_number)
    {
        // Going to abort on all signals
        vcos_log_error(""Aborting program\n"");

        // TODO : Need to close any open stuff...how?

       exit(255);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the capture process ending execution in 100ms on average.</p>

<p>As noted in the comments to this answer this can be accomplished in Python by using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    popen = subprocess.Popen ( cmd )
    .
    .
    .
    popen.send_signal ( signal.SIGINT )
</code></pre>

<p>Another method would be using user data callback, that has field:</p>

<pre><code>    callback_data.abort = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>and you may guess what happens if you set this field to anything except zero =)</p>

"Can the Pi Emulate an HID device with via USB?","8869","","<p>Does the Raspberry Pi model B+ have the capabilities of acting as a Human Interface Device (HID) with no extra hardware (other than a USB to USB cable)? </p>

<p>I saw <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/22264/can-the-new-raspberry-pi-b-act-as-a-usb-sniffer"">this question</a> but it was about capturing output from the computer. My goal would be to trick a computer into thinking a mouse/keyboard is attached and send key presses or mouse clicks. Any ideas?</p>
","<p>Even though the USB port of the RPi is technically an On-the-go (OTG) chip that should support both a reduced set of host and client functionality (and could therefore play the role of an USB slave such as an HID) the B/B+ type of the RPi does not support the device mode. That is related to the included USB hub and the fact that the ethernet is tunneled through USB (<a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=15696"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see</a>).</p>

<p>But... the Human Interface Devices (HID) only need the USB 1.1 <em>Low Speed</em> with 1.5 MBit/s data rate (well almost they say). So there are many solutions out there that use software based USB stacks to emulate an USB device. Those examples typically use microcontrollers that are way less ""powerful"" than the RaspberryPi (but of course they also have a significantly lower overhead). Examples include the Igor Plug (an IR remote control receiver based on an Atmel microcontroller) or microcontroller based ""fake"" keyboards or ""key loggers"". </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Connecting a keyboard to the device and running suggested command is an option, but outside of this question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Jessie uses systemd which includes a new-fangled logger, journald.  I think systemd is great, but since journald <em>keeps its log in a binary format</em>, it is a PITA for stuff like this (where you want/need to look for errors in the log without the system running).</p>

<p>There is a way to examine journald files using a journald tool on another system (see Wilf's comment below).  Raspbian by default keeps the journald log on disk, but I've always disabled this since it tends to become ginormous (i.e., the binary format is not a space saving one).</p>

<p>This does indicate an advantage to journald, namely it keeps a system log in memory and hence does not require a read-write filesystem be available (making it particularly useful if you are running in emergency mode).</p>

<p>Fortunately, logging to disk can also be done in a human readable format via old school syslog, and Raspbian is default configured that way.  The configuration (see <code>/etc/rsyslog.conf</code>) dumps a copy of everything to <code>/var/log/syslog</code>.  This includes stuff from the kernel that you can view with <code>dmesg</code> when the system is running.</p>

<p>There is a caveat: If the system failed before the root filesystem was mounted read-write, <strong>there will be nothing to read</strong> about whatever happened and no indication in the on disk logs that the system even booted.</p>

"Is SD card corruption still an issue?","8823","","<p>For a project I'm using a 16GB class 10 Sandisk micro SD card (in an Adafruit micro SD card adaptor). I've got a Model B Raspberry Pi that's not overclocked, nor has it ever been. Since I'm running it headless I have assigned 48M to the GPU (lower than that and the Pi refuses to boot). I use a 2A USB charger to power the Pi.</p>

<p>I've read a lot about SD card corruption and people having issues in general with different types of SD cards or power supplies. Having never run into any of these problems before myself, I wonder if SD card corruption is still an issue or if it is something that will, no matter what, creep up over time because the SD card simply deteriorates.</p>

<p>Anyone who could shed a light on this?</p>

<p>If indeed this is still a problem, an solution could apparently be to boot from and SD card and have the root partition (and any other partitioins) on a USB stick. Why then would the partition on the USB stick not get corrupted?</p>
","<p>Yes. SD cards are volatile, and, as all memory does, <em>will</em> deteriorate over time. Nothing you really can do about it besides not use the device. This is  because of the need to be small, the technology isn't quite as long lasting as a Hard Drive or SSD/RAM. Basically, all memory <em>will</em> deteriorate eventually, it just depends on the use it is put through. </p>

<p>More Read/Write cycles will break your SD card faster than less Read/Write, which might be rather obvious to some. Thus, if you are using the Pi for data gathering or serving up a web page, or anything that read/writes a lot, you should probably use USB data storage, to protect your Pi's SD card.</p>

<p>That said, your solution of booting from the SD card and then having all the other partitions on USB <em>should</em> extend your SD card life. If you want to find more about corruption and how to prevent it, check <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/7978/how-can-i-prevent-my-pis-sd-card-from-getting-corrupted-so-often?rq=1"">here</a>.

However, searching that in Arch AUR doesn't return anything.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=7471"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This thread</a> looked like it would work, but the top link is dead!</p>

<p>What should I be looking for? I am comfortable with compiling software, if need be, and I have a USB hub, so I can transfer files to the Pi that way. Where can I find the driver necessary to run this dongle and how should I install it? </p>
","<p>The driver you need is in the repositories.</p>

<pre><code>pacman -Sy dkms-8192cu
</code></pre>

<p>If you could get internet access temporarily, you could simply download and install it.</p>

"Can I stream 1080p video from the Pi?","8818","","<p>We all know the Pi can play 1080p video no problem, but is it fast enough to act as the basis for a file server that can stream 1080p video over its wired network connection?</p>

<p>I'm thinking of using mine as a media server of sorts to stream 1080p HD video, (with DTS-HD audio), and I am interested to know if anyone else has tried it or if the Pi is up to the task.</p>
","<p>I tested network throughput with <code>iperf</code> and it can push around 90 Mbps of TCP through happily. If I recall corectly, Full HD video requires around 25-35 Mbps, so my guess would be that yes.</p>

<p>You may want to consider something faster than a SD card to store media files on. While a Class 6 is probably enough, Class 4 probably isn't.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
I did a more realistic test of I/O - reading from SD card and pushing the data over the network.</p>

<p>On Raspberry Pi (Raspbian):</p>

<pre><code>nc 192.168.105.225 337 &lt; /dev/mmcblk0
</code></pre>

<p>On another machine on the same LAN (bridged):</p>

<pre><code>nc -l 337 &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>The router (bridge) showed 44 Mbps of traffic being pushed by Pi. Considering that I have a Class 4 SD card this implies that I/O on Pi is not a bottleneck at these speeds.</p>

<p>Resource consumption during a test (it's quite high):
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YFcGl.png"" alt=""top""></p>

<p>I will try with an attached USB hard drive soon to see if it can push a full 100 Mbps.</p>

<pre><code>sudo a2ensite default

<p>That command essentially renews the symlinks between the two directories.
So, the default site configuration is broken, but it's not actually needed. You can safely delete the contents of <code>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>apache2.conf</code> file already contains a site configuration at the bottom, so it should work without any sites enabled, but add any new sites into the <code>sites-available/</code> directory and enable them with the <code>a2ensite</code>.</p>

<p>Now I want to use <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/openhab/"" rel=""nofollow"">openHAB</a> version 1.3 with the new Z-Wave binding. </p>

<p>The [documentation] (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/openhab/wiki/ZWaveBinding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/openhab/wiki/ZWaveBinding</a>) on binding tells that the zwave:port has to be /dev/ttyS0 on linux systems:</p>

<p>What is the right value?</p>
","<p>The right device is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/dev/ttyAMA0</p>

<p>Make sure that the openHAB process has sufficient rights and that Z-Way (if installed) is stopped (/etc/init.d/Z-Way stop).</p>

<p>Because of the uncommon name of the Device, you have to tell openHAB at startup that this is a RXTX device - append </p>

"PiGPIO Library Example for Bit-Banging a UART","8799","","<p>The PiGPIO library
<a href=""http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/index.html</a> mentions that one of it's features is ""software serial links using any user gpio"". </p>

<p>I take this to mean that you can use it to generate a software UART on any 2 free GPIO pins. </p>

<p>In the projects' examples page, there is are no examples for this feature and I have found none on Google.</p>

<p>Has anyone done this? If so please point me to the example.</p>

<p>If not, are there any alternative libraries for bit-banging a UART?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
","<p>Here is some Python I used to test the reliability of software serial.  The input side is fairly trivial.  You just make the appropriate bit bang serial open calls in Python or C.  The output side is more involved as you have to use waveforms to construct the bit stream.</p>

<p>The code here is using 7-bit rather than 8-bit data.  The test was written at about the same time as I was adding support for different bits per byte.</p>

<p>The code writes blocks of binary data to a gpio connected to a laptop (via serial dongle).  The laptop echoes the incoming serial data to its output serial line.  The Pi reads the serial data on another gpio.</p>

<p>The code checks for discrepancies between the sent and received data.  The laptop is assumed to be error free, so any errors are assumed to be in the bit banging.</p>

<p>Looking at the logs anything less than 19.2kbps was solid.  Anything up to 115.2kbps was reasonable (but would require checksumming) and 230.4kbps gave a 13% byte error rate.</p>

"How can I get Raspivid to skip h264 encoding? (getting rid of 5 second latency streaming video)","8698","","<p>There are gazillions of forums and threads about getting rid of a 5 second latency when using a Pi together with a PI-Cam as a surveillance camera. Many tutorials show how to use vlc to encode and stream the images using the RTP protocol which results in a ~5 second lag.</p>

<p>According to me, the reason is that raspivid is encoding the stream to H264, while VLC has to decode it again and re-encode it to whatever RTP is. The commandline looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>raspivid -w 640 -h 480 -o - -t 0 |cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' :demux=h264
</code></pre>

<p>The first part tells raspivid to stream video to the standard output:</p>

<pre><code>raspivid -w 640 -h 480 -o - -t 0 
</code></pre>

<p>The part after the pipe, tells VLC to pick it up, and decode it using h264:</p>

<pre><code>cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' :demux=h264
</code></pre>

<p>This mux-ing and demux-ing is quite a waist of resources!</p>

<p>I found the <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland/blob/master/host_applications/linux/apps/raspicam/RaspiVid.c"">sources of raspicam</a> at github, and I think something can be done in the encoder_buffer_callback method (currently at line 848) to skip the encoding. However I'm not good at c, and not familiar with video encoding at all, so I don't have a clue where to begin.</p>

<p>On Github I can see 330 forks, but they don't seem to be specifically for raspicam (rather for the whole userland project). I got lost trying to find a fork that removed encoding or implemented something simpler like mjpeg.</p>

<p>Could someone with c and video codec knowledge help me and the other gazillion users to get rid of the latency? Probably the solution is already out there in one of those forks, but I've spent hours searching for it without any luck.</p>

<p>p.s. I'm not looking for a <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43&amp;t=63276&amp;p=468491#p468491"">browser solution</a>, but I ultimately want to stream it to a Synology, preferably using mjpeg streaming (but not via a webpage, rather a standard mjpeg stream that comes built into most commercial ip-cams). First step is gettig rid of h264.</p>
","<p>Some folks have been working hard on this since I first asked this question, and by this time there are a few options (strange that no-one has responded to this question yet). I have tried <a href=""http://www.sonsoftone.com/?page_id=287"" rel=""nofollow"">RaspberrIPCam</a> and had some success, however it seems like the rtsp packets had an extremely short TTL or something. Having the Pi hooked up directly to a router next to my PC it would work perfectly. But as soon as I installed the cam where I wanted it, and tried to access the stream with two routers between, no image would arrive. I checked the source-code and found the TTL set to maximum. I never figured it out completely.</p>

<p>Currently I would recommend <a href=""https://github.com/ronnyvdbr/RaspberryIPCamera"" rel=""nofollow"">RaspberryIPCamera</a> wich has a nice user interface (see <a href=""http://ronnyvdbr.github.io/RaspberryIPCamera/"" rel=""nofollow"">screenshots</a>) and there even is a ready-made SD-card image for it. I have tried the SD-card, but reverted to doing a manual install as described <a href=""https://github.com/ronnyvdbr/RaspberryIPCamera/blob/master/installation.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> with great success (my current setup). Instructions for hooking it up to a Synology DiskStation are <a href=""http://random-notes-of-a-sysadmin.blogspot.nl/2016/03/howto-set-up-raspberry-ip-camera-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">also available</a> and are working perfectly on my system. The problem with the SD card image was that I was unable to expand the filesystem to the full extent of the SD card (I also want to run some other stuff on it to control some relays via the GPIO pins).</p>

<p>The above solution uses components of the UV4L project. The documentation of the UV4L project on this <a href=""http://www.linux-projects.org/uv4l/tutorials/streaming-server/"" rel=""nofollow"">page</a> also mentions: </p>

<p>There is no need for many USB cables to carry more than a fraction of an amp so they would be built with thin wire.  Thin wire is cheaper and lighter than slightly thicker wire.

I read <a href=""https://github.com/retropie/retropie-setup/wiki/Nintendo-DS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> there is a nds emulator for Retropie called ""desmume"".</p>

<p>People say that to run that kind of roms (.nds files) there are 2 problems with the Pi:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first is, the Pi 3 does not have enough processing power to have a good experience running nds games. It seems it gives a very low FPS. (I don't know because it didn't worked for me yet).</li>
<li>Secondly,  you need a X server and Desktop Environment to run it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure about the second point... I read <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=78&amp;t=51494"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> you can set up desmume using cli. I followed the steps described there... I installed ""desmume"" using <code>sudo apt-get install desmume</code>. I already created the nds folder on config and roms directory, I put nds roms there, I added to <code>/etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg</code> the code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;nds&lt;/name&gt;

    &lt;platform&gt;nds&lt;/platform&gt;
    &lt;theme&gt;nds&lt;/theme&gt;
&lt;/system&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I did the trick suggested there to use desmume-cli instead of desmume to avoid the need to have a X system. I added a retroarch.cfg file copied from other emulator directory and added on it:</p>

<pre><code>input_remapping_directory = ""/opt/retropie/configs/nds/""
</code></pre>

<p>And also added the emulators.cfg file with this content:</p>

default=""desmume""
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can see the Nintendo DS with the roms on Emulationstation menues but it didn't worked for me. Any advice from anybody who made it work? Where can I see some kind of log to see what is happenning? Thanks.</p>

<p>Since it identifies itself by chip manufacturer and model number.  Beware that if you plug this dongle in while the pi is running, it will kill the power momentarily -- causing an unclean shutdown and a reboot.  So don't do that, it could lead to grief.  Plug it in before you boot or use a hub.  Unplugging it is okay.</p>

<p>The driver for this is the <strong>8192cu</strong> driver, which should be bundled with the kernel whatever distro you are using.  While it's plugged in, try <code>lsmod | grep 8192</code> and you should see it listed.  If so, the dongle has been detected and is ready to use, try <code>iwconfig</code> and you should see somewhere in there:</p>

<pre><code>wlan0     unassociated  Nickname:""&lt;WIFI@REALTEK&gt;""

<p>If not, try <code>modprobe 8192cu</code> and see what that says (if it says nothing, run <code>lsmod</code> again and check).</p>

<p>In my experience, the dongle runs a bit glitchy on the pi -- used on another linux system with the same driver, it's fine, but on the pi it seems to drop the connection occasionally.  Also, on the other system the little blue led inside stays on -- on the pi it blinks.  However, if your software compensates for the occasionally disconnect, it is not noticeable and works fine.</p>

<p>Not a chance.  Unfortunately, most manufacturers do not support linux and so other people have to write the drivers, which is why there is not necessarily a perfect one for every device.

<p>This is using the latest hf Arch Arm kernel. </p>
","<p>Quoting from <code>ntpd</code> <a href=""http://doc.ntp.org/4.1.0/ntpd.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In case there is no TOY chip or for some reason its time is more than
  1000s from the server time, ntpd assumes something must be terribly
  wrong and the only reliable action is for the operator to intervene
  and set the clock by hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, quoting from the <code>ntpd</code> man page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-s</strong> Set the time immediately at startup if the local clock is off by more than 180 seconds.  Allows for a large time correction, eliminating the need to run rdate(8) before starting.</p>

<p>So a <code>ntpd -s</code> in a terminal should be sufficient to fix the problem and let <code>ntpd</code> adjust the time normally from there on.</p>

"Can't send data from the Raspberry Pi via rs485 and serial port","8423","","<p>I have Raspberry 2B with Raspbian Jessie. I want my Raspberry Pi can communicate with some sensors via RS-485 interface. I tried to use three types of adapters:</p>

<ul>
<li>USB-RS-485 adapter;</li>
<li>USB-RS-232 adapter with RS-232 to RS-485 converter;</li>
<li>MAX485.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGtXX.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGtXX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>At first I tried to communicate with the sensors from my PC (Windows) and everything works just fine, serial ports and adapters work perfectly. Next I tried to repeat this on my Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>A have done all preparations on the Raspberry Pi to communicate via serial port and RS-485 (using <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Read-and-write-from-serial-port-with-Raspberry-Pi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> and others in the Internet). Then I wrote a communication script with Python (and Mono + C#, and C++ but there was the same problem). There is Python code for serial port connection, sender and receiver:</p>

<pre><code>import serial
import time

# Such parameters are required for the sensors so I use them
receiver = serial.Serial(     
     port='/dev/ttyUSB0',
     baudrate = 9600,
     parity=serial.PARITY_EVEN,
     stopbits=serial.STOPBITS_ONE,
     bytesize=serial.SEVENBITS,
     timeout=1
     )

while 1:
      x = receiver.readline()
      print x

# -----------------------------------
sender = serial.Serial(     
     port='/dev/ttyUSB1',
     baudrate = 9600,
     parity=serial.PARITY_EVEN,
     stopbits=serial.STOPBITS_ONE,
     bytesize=serial.SEVENBITS,
     timeout=1
     )

while 1:
      sender.write('Test message')
      time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>

<p>When I connect both adapters to the Raspberry (to make an echo) this script works fine, I can send and receive messages in both directions. It's OK!</p>

<p><strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong> when I try to connect the Raspberry with the sensors or with the PC with same Python script the Raspberry can <strong>only receive messages from the outside but it can't send messages outside</strong> (with different parameters, program languages, etc.). They are just lost. There are no any exceptions, error codes or something else.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what could be the problem? Help me please! Googling does not help. Maybe the problem is in permissions? Maybe I forgot about some settings of serial ports? Or do I use wrong devices (but they work with my PC)?</p>
","<p>Alexander.
I also try to use this adapters :<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vvRl7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vvRl7.jpg"" alt=""USB-RS485""></a> <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QFBCz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QFBCz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>.</p>

<p>I need this adapters to polling counters of electroenergy (like Энергомера CE102M, Меркурий 230) with using Raspberry Pi. My Raspberry Pi is model B+ with raspbian jessie.</p>

<p>First, USB-RS485, recognized as /dev/ttyUSB0. But his driver (ch341) does not support mode 9600/7databits/even/1stopbit (as writen here (<a href=""http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c?v=4.4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c?v=4.4</a>), this does not support parity, various count databits and stopbits).
However, there is driver (<a href=""http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_LINUX_ZIP.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_LINUX_ZIP.html</a>) where fixed some problems. E.g. serial device now responds on changing count of databits. But not for parity. To test this i connect 2 same devices between themselves via RS485 and connect them to Raspberry Pi.  Then i use picocom to change device paramters and trancive data between them. 
When i use this adapter with Windows, this works perfectly in mode 9600/7databits/even/1stopbit. Because used other driver. </p>

<p>Second, UART-RS485, recognized as /dev/ttyAMA0 (if all preparations is fine).
With this device i don't find true way to connect this to GPIO (i relied on this scheme <a href=""https://www.homegear.eu/index.php/RS485_Serial_Module"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.homegear.eu/index.php/RS485_Serial_Module</a>). As i understand, besides GPIO 14 (UART RX) and GPIO 15 (UART TX), need RTS and CTS signals to hardware flow control. These features may get as described here (<a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=768770#p768770"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=768770#p768770</a>) on GPIO 16 and GPIO 17. I try this, but i recieve echo-signal when send some data over this device. And programm for polling my devices over RS-485 recieve error. If i don't use RTS/CTS, i can only write to this device, but can't read. I think, when use /dev/ttyAMA0, need right use RTS/CTS signals and use rtscts=True when create object of Serial:</p>

<p><code>ser=serial.Serial(port='/dev/ttyUSB0',baudrate = 9600,rtscts=True)</code></p>

<p>I also try connect these adapters together via RS-485 to test them (see <a href=""http://raspberrypi.ru/forum/topic/1044/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://raspberrypi.ru/forum/topic/1044/</a>). </p>

<p>I also have USB-RS-485/CAN adapter (<a href=""http://incotex-counter.blogspot.ru/2012/04/usb-rs485can.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://incotex-counter.blogspot.ru/2012/04/usb-rs485can.html</a>), that works fine with two types of my devices (Энергомера СЕ102М (amount:36) and Меркурий 230 (amount:6), all devices connected to one bus RS-485). It connected to Raspberry Pi where runnning ser2net (to access to serial port over Internet). This device based on FTDI chip and his driver support all modes of serial ports (various parity, databits, stopbits).</p>

<p>Update. 
Now i build driver ch34x from sources (<a href=""http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_LINUX_ZIP.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_LINUX_ZIP.html</a>):
<code>make
make load</code>
and i have driver ch34x. Then i assign this driver to usb-rs485 dongle (see this <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/284106/using-specific-driver-version-for-the-device-jointly-defaul-driver"">https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/284106/using-specific-driver-version-for-the-device-jointly-defaul-driver</a>). Now, on restart this driver loaded firtst to work with usb-rs485. To polling Энергомера CE120M via RS-485 i use ser2net with config (<code>/etc/ser2net.conf</code>):
<code>#Energomera CE102M
2000:raw:200:/dev/ttyUSB0:9600 7DATABITS EVEN 1STOPBIT
</code>. In AminTools i use channel based on Ethernet (i use ip-address of Raspberry Pi and tcp port 2000). For Энергомера СЕ303 settings are same (7databits/even/1stopbit), beside you need select appropriate device type in AdminTools.</p>

"Verified 4G USB dongles","8414","","<p>Is it possible that there are no verified 4G USB dongles for RPI, or <a href=""http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals"" rel=""nofollow"">the following link</a> is out of date?</p>

<p>If so, why is it?
If not, where are they listed?</p>
","<p>The elinux pages are sometimes out-of-date, but it is also worth noting that those lists are not <em>exhauastive</em> by nature, hopefully that does not require further explanation.</p>

<p>Whether a device will work is largely dependent on whether a driver for it exists, which is dependent on the operating system.  Elinux is obviously linux-centric and I'll presume you're using some form of such too, e.g., Raspbian, although what's really of concern here is <em>the kernel</em> (""Linux"" proper actually only refers to the kernel) since that's what controls hardware and where drivers are implemented, and there is really only one series of the kernel version in use on the pi regardless of distro.</p>

<p>There are various 4G USB modem drivers referenced by USB ID in the kernel source.  The hard part, without actually having the dongle, is getting the USB ID appropriate to the chipset it uses.  Sometimes you can find them online.  USB IDs are in the form <code>xxxx:xxxx</code>, where the x's are hexadecimal digits.  For example, <a href=""https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#q=Airtel%20MF825A%20USB%20id"" rel=""nofollow"">searching ""Airtel MF825A USB id""</a> yields various hits including <a href=""http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/bb/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1645"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>, from which it is pretty easy to garner the USB ID is <code>19d2:1408</code>.</p>

<p>Now for the even more tedious part, checking <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">the kernel source</a> to see if there's a driver that references this.  Despite the awkwardness, this is a pretty reliable technique because it is those numbers that USB devices report when they are plugged in, and then the kernel uses them to locate a driver.</p>

<p>All the USB networking driver sources are in the <code>drivers/net/usb</code> directory, which for the pi kernel in particular you can <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tree/rpi-4.1.y/drivers/net/usb"" rel=""nofollow"">browse here</a> although it is unlikely to be any different than the vanilla version in this context.  Anyway, <code>grep 19d2 *</code> in that directory does turn up a list of things from the <code>qmi_wwan</code> driver, but it doesn't include 1408 -- however, there is a list of other models identified in comments there.  If we have one of those, the question then is whether that driver was included in the pre-built pi kernel; you can browser the modules in your own <code>/lib/modules/xxx</code> (for <code>xxx</code>, check <code>uname -r</code>) or <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/modules"" rel=""nofollow"">in the firmware repo in the Foundation's github</a>.  It's the <code>kernel/drivers/net/usb</code> directory we want to look in.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>And low and behold, <code>qmi_wwan.ko</code> is there, so things such as the ""ZTE MF683"", mentioned at line 718 of <a href=""https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-4.1.y/drivers/net/usb/qmi_wwan.c"" rel=""nofollow"">that source</a>, should work.</p>

<p>That's an idealized version of a procedure.  Basically, if you have something in mind start by searching online for ""linux Acme XY700"" and go from there.  Don't include ""raspberry pi"" in the search or the results will be much more limited, but once you believe that the device does have a linux driver, you probably do want to make sure it is included in the pi kernel (e.g., by asking here directly).</p>

<p><sub>1. Beware the difference between the <code>kernel/drivers/net/...</code> directory and <code>kernel/net/...</code> directory with this stuff.</sub></p>

<p>You should be able to just change <code>stretch</code> to <code>buster</code>, and then run:</p>

<hr>

<p>On to your bonus question: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where should I drop the request to update the default PHP version of Raspbian?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The default version of PHP in Raspbian is extremely <strong>unlikely to be changed</strong> for now, because of the <a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases#Release_statistics"" rel=""noreferrer"">way that Debian's release cycles work</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the above array, data closely following ""current"" releasing tendencies have been highlighted in green. What can be deduced from those data is that the ""most-typical"" Debian release:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>endures a freeze cycle of 7 +/- 1 months before getting released.</li>
  <li>is released about 2 years after the previous one (the often cited example of Debian Sarge being quite an exceptional event in Debian history).</li>
  <li>leaves users about 1 year to upgrade to the next one once this latter itself gets released.</li>
  <li>has (from release to the end of security updates) a total lifetime of about 3 years.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Stretch was frozen <a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStretch"" rel=""noreferrer"">in February 2017</a>, so there will be no new feature updates to the PHP package in the Stretch repositories. So, for the foreseeable future, the PHP package will remain outdated in stable until Raspbian <a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBuster"" rel=""noreferrer"">Buster</a> becomes stable (at which point, the PHP package there will become outdated, ad infinitum).</p>

<p>It's just the nature of Debian: you trade away the newest packages in exchange for greater stability, and you'll have to stick to the testing release if you want the latest features.</p>

"Pi to act as GSM voice phone","8349","","<p><em>I won't know for certain until I've implemented it, but I've marked ppumkin's answer as The Answer.</em></p>

<p>I will have a Huawei 3G (or GSM) dongle attached to my raspberry pi. I haven't purchased it yet, since the model may be determined by the answer to this question.</p>

<p>I would like my raspberry pi to be able to receive a phone call through the dongle, using a headset to allow the user to hold a conversation. It has no need to initiate the phone call. </p>

<p>Basically I'd like my raspberry pi to act as a voice-only phone. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>This project uses Python on Raspbian Wheezy.</p>

<p>One more note: I'd rather not use a full PBX system like Asterisk because this functionality forms only part of the overall system. </p>

<p>EDIT: To narrow the question, I'm concerned mainly with the communication between the dongle and my python program. I expect that playing sounds and capturing microphone input is widely documented. To be more specific: <strong>If a call is made to the GSM dongle attached to my pi, how do I get a python script to answer the call?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT 2: <a href=""http://wiki.e1550.mobi/doku.php?id=requirements"" rel=""nofollow"">This list</a> of dongles that can be used with Asterisk leads me to believe that it is possible (thanks ppumkin)</p>

<p><strong>A little background on the project</strong><br>
I will be putting one piece of equipment each in a series of rural classroooms in Southern Africa (to start with). The kit will consist of a projector, an Rpi, and a GSM dongle. The purpose of the kit is to allow teachers anywhere in the world to hold remote lessons with students there who would not otherwise have access to education. Since the kit will have to be built through donations, the price of the components is crucial. </p>

<p>The teachers will have 2-way voice communication and 1-way blackboard. The blackboard will be controlled via SMS, but the voice communication needs to be done over GSM voice. The geographic locations that I'm looking at will have GSM coverage but, if anything at all, they will have at most 2G data coverage.</p>

<p>All communication over GSM will come from a server which will be hosted in the same country as the classrooms and the link between that server and the teachers will be over TCP/IP.</p>
","<p><em>For the default use of them that is not possible with GPRS/EDGE/3G/HSDPA/4G dongles. They are designed for data only.</em></p>

<p>But as pointed out by the OP there does seem to some development for Huawei dongles. What it requires though:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check if the dongle supports voice. Some microchips have the audio processor built in with everything else but the firmware disables it usage.</li>
<li>Flash the dongle with a custom firmware that will enable the audio hardware and API</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Loading custom firmware might brick (render the device useless) so take extreme care before trying anything like this.</strong></p>

<p>It is the flashing of custom firmware that will unlock the GSM API and the use of a experimental Asterisk channel provider <a href=""http://wiki.e1550.mobi/doku.php?id=introduction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chan_dongle</a>.</p>

<p>It all seems experimental at the moment, however looking at the site people manage to set up 48 GSM channels using Asterisk! Pretty impressive...</p>

<p>I suspect Asterisk does all the encoding and decoding of audio and passes the data to the custom firmware which allows you to make a normal phone call. </p>

<p><strong>The alternatives</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What you can do though is <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/9196/using-raspberry-pi-as-voip-phone-with-usb-sound-device/9198#9198"">run Asterisk on the Pi and connect to VoiP servers</a>.But there is no microphone the Pi and <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/search?q=recording%20audio"">USB Audio devices seem to cause allot of problems with recording audio</a>.</li>
<li>Just buy a cheap mobile phone if you need to make phone calls.</li>
<li>You can buy a hardware GSM gateway. You put sim cards in there and the hardware does all the work. You just use Asterisk to connect to it like a VoiP connection.</li>

<p>Compiling <code>mongopi</code> will stop at the exact same file with the same error message.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I realized that my system was dramatically outdated. But even upgrading to the latest versions didn't resolve the problem. At this point, I'm assuming that it is indeed an issue with free memory. Given that I only have an early 256 MB model.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Please note that this answer only applied to the 256 MB version of the Raspberry Pi. The 512 MB version should have sufficient free memory to compile MongoDB without additional adjustments</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While reading about low-memory situation's in general, I found suggestions to simply increase the swap space to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>So, after reading <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/4914/87"">bearbin's answer</a>, I was convinced that this could be a valid option. However, I opted to add swap space <em>without</em> utilizing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRam"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">zRAM</a>.</p>

<p>Because I can never remember the full process for <em>anything</em>, I followed the guide <a href=""http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-add-a-swap-file-howto/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Linux Add a Swap File – Howto</a> by Nixcraft.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create swap file/storage space:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=524288
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Set space up as swap area:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkswap /swapfile1
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Only allow root to read/write:  </p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod 0600 /swapfile1
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Enable swap area:</p>

<pre><code>sudo swapon /swapfile1
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Afterwards, <code>scons</code> completed successfully and I was able to install MongoDB. I used the <code>mongopi</code> fork in the end.</p>

"How to make the Raspberry Pi consume less power","8323","","<p>What methods can be used to reduce the amount of power a Raspberry Pi uses? </p>
","<p>Unplug it from mains power :)</p>

<p>But seriously: the Pi has a ""base"" power usage when run headless, without anything plugged in (no monitor, no usb devices, just the power supply). Use a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00009MDBU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kill-A-Watt meter</a> to measure the powerusage of this setup. Then do the following:</p>

<p>If you want to further reduce this power usage, you can look into disabling a few things. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=99372"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">According to this article</a>, if you have an rPi2, you can reduce<br>
the number of cores by adding the following lines into<br>
<code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code>:</p>

<p><code># replace N with the number of cores you want to keep using</code><br>
   <code>maxcpus=N</code></p></li>
<li><p>You could look into disabling power to the USB bus by issuing the
following (from <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8448/disabling-usb-ports"">this post</a> on this forum):</p>

<p><code>echo 0x0 &gt; /sys/devices/platform/bcm2708_usb/buspower</code></p>

<p>NOTE OF WARNING: This might also disable your network port, so don't
use this in a headless setup until you have made sure you can recover
from it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Use the Kill-A-Watt meter to check the impact these changes have to power usage.</p>

<p>If you need to use additional devices, such as an HDMI monitor, USB devices including WiFi dongles etc., keep the Kill-A-Watt meter hooked up to your Pi and look at the impact of adding each device in (shut down Pi, add 1 device, reboot Pi, make sure device is in use (E.g. WiFi dongle is connected/connecting to network) and observe the output of the Kill-A-Watt meter.</p>

"Arduino Serial Port via Raspberry Pi SSH","8262","","<p>I have just bought an Arduino Uno R3 and I would like to view the Serial Monitor using my Raspberry Pi via SSH. </p>

<p>I have looked around on forum sites but cannot seem to find the proper software or commands. I recently saw the I could use <code>screen</code> on the Pi but no clue where to use it. Also how do I go about finding the UART address under  <code>/dev/tty</code> on my Pi which is connected to my Arduino. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>I think the OP wants to SSH into the Pi and read the UART from the Arduino! :)  </p>

<p>You first need to work out which UART to look on. The Pi has 2 UART's but only 1 is availble, which by default is in use by the console. <a href=""http://www.raspberry-projects.com/pi/pi-operating-systems/raspbian/io-pins-raspbian/uart-pins"" rel=""nofollow"">You need to turn this off first and reboot!</a> Unless you are using a USB serial port. </p>

<p>A roboust serial manage is minicom!</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install minicom
</code></pre>

<p>And since you are using the UART port you just disabled you know its called AMA0. You just need to know what baud the Arduino is running at, its usually setup to default at 9600. But, you may have changed it to 115000 - With the Pi the 115kbs might not work and its better to start of at 9600, then work up if you need more speed. But usually only binary data needs higher baud, which I don't think you are doing.</p>

<pre><code>minicom -b &lt;baud&gt; -o -D /dev/ttyAMA0
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can write text by typing as usual, and it will go to your Arduino via minicom, or just read the output if you logging stuff on the Arduino and dumping it to <code>serial</code></p>

<p>You are correct, you can use screen on the Pi while on a SSH session. <code>screen</code> is used to execute things in a separate ""screens"". You can use many screens running and switch between them via one SSH session.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install screen
</code></pre>

<p>and then again just run it like</p>

I have not done any tests, yet, but I am under the assumption (and correct me if I am wrong) that a 3G modem plugged into a Raspberry Pi and connected to a network will use power, and given the environment, any extra power usage is a non requirement. So, how, programmatically, can I turn on and off a 3G modem, or the USB connector on a Raspberry Pi? </p>
","<p>Sadly there is no way to fully power off with software alone. You will need to add a switching circuit connected over the GPIO pins to trigger a ""hardware disconnect"" by cutting power to your hardware.</p>

<p>To switch with GPIO it's just a simple transistor circuit.</p>

Normal audio works as expected, when playing a shockwave file in Midori with gnash for example.</p>

<p>I turned the <strong>Audible bell</strong> setting in <strong>LXTerminal</strong> preferences <strong>ON</strong>, and tried the following:</p>

There is no option, like in the Windows version of PuTTY, to play a custom sound file when a bell occurs.</p>

<p>I've read that running <code># modprobe snd_hda_intel</code> on other linux machines can redirect sound output intended for the PC speaker (which the raspberry lacks) to ALSA.  Running that command tells me that this module is not found.  I don't know how to acquire it with apt. </p>

<p>The system will run all day long, and I hope it can last at least 5 years without troubles.</p>

<p>It will run on UPS, with everything needed for autoreboot, and good SD cards.</p>

<p>I know that a computer with no moving parts is already a good idea for that purpose, but I can't find info about long term reliability of the Raspberry Pi (except about pure hardware failures on the Pi itself). </p>

<p>Is the Raspberry Pi suitable for such long term exploitation? Does anyone have info about years-long uptime with Raspberry Pi?</p>
","<p>I assume you're talking about using the Pi for digital signage purposes. 
For the last years we have deployed hundreds of Pi's doing exactly that.</p>

<p>Many of our Pi's are not as lucky as yours: they're not on UPS and/or are on 'dirty' power lines.  Lost phases, powercuts and power surge peaks are common.  Roughly calculated we have about 1% failure - totally over all the years over all the Pis.  This includes human originated damage.</p>

<p>Many people complain or warn about potential SD card failure.  I mustn't pretend that this is not true.  But I personally haven't had any issues with that.  Granted, we don't write that often but we also don't avoid writing.  If you not log every time the seconds change, I doubt that it's going to be an issue.  Definitely not for digital signage.</p>

<p>Our setup generally is: Pi, $0.1 heatsink, $3 power adaptor, $1 HDMI cable, $0.01 plastic business card box casing with holes punched into them.  For SD we use a variety of sizes and brands.  Actually mostly non-brands; 4GB class 4 cards often collected from the bottom of drawers or pen holders.  Or new $2 retail Sandisk class 4 cards. The stuff nobody wants.  If I could buy them by the kilo I would.</p>

<li>Compile Node.js yourself <sup>(as <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/4629/5556"">ppumkin already pointed out</a>)</sup>&mdash;takes about 2 hours on a Raspberry Pi. </li>

</ol>

<h1>Performance</h1>

<p>I did a quick performance test (to give a rough first impression):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My Raspberry Pi is overclocked (Turbo) with default memory_split (64)</p></li>
<li><p>Tests were performed over my local network (802.11g Wifi).</p></li>
<li><p>I used the standard ""Hello World"" example from the Node.js website:</p>

<pre><code>var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(1337, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/');

<p>The first card I did this on (sandisk class 4) gave a write speed of 5.4 MB/s, which is about what I expected based on the results on that page.  However, the read speed was 21.6 MB/s, which there are almost no class 4 cards listed that come anywhere close.</p>

<p>The other card (adata class 10) had a (disappointing) write speed of 7.6 MB/s, and <em>an identical read speed</em>, 21.6 MB/s.</p>

<p>1) Is this possible?</p>

<p>2) Is there an easy way to revert back to normal?</p>

<p>3) Is there a way to use less CPU if desired?</p>

<p>I'm thinking of a command line interaction like:</p>

<p><code>pi@raspberry:~ $ sudo turnOnFourCores python run.py</code></p>
","<p>By default, any computer will try to use all of its cores when it can. However, it can only achieve this when an application is multi-threaded. If it is not (i.e. a Python script that doesn't use the <code>threading</code> module), then it can only use at maximum, one core. This equates to 25% of the CPU on a four-core CPU. If you'd like to modify your script to use multiple cores, you can split your calculation into multiple parts, and multi-thread it as shown in the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>As <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/75527/62449"">Anon answered</a>, this will fail to work without working with Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). This allows tasks to operate (seemingly) at the same time, but does not allow code to run across multiple cores. If you are using modules written in C (e.g. numpy), they can <a href=""https://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/ParallelProgramming"" rel=""noreferrer"">allow you to use multiple cores</a> go around that limitation. Additionally, if that is not an option, Python offers <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">multiprocessing</a>, which allows you to run any task on multiple cores.</p>

"Would you recommend a Raspberry Pi as a remote file backup device?","8171","","<p>I'd like to have a computer at home that I <code>rsync</code> my files to from anywhere, preferably at any time I choose. The daily volume of data will rarely exceed 100M. It needs to be cheap and easy to replace, not fast (it's for backup/archiving purposes only).</p>

<p>One idea is to use a Raspberry Pi with a USB hard disk.  (Or two.)
Would you? Can you list any drawbacks that make alternatives obviously superior?</p>
","<p>I also think this is a good setup. I currently do run a Raspberry Pi, connected directly with a 3.5'' USB 2.0 hard disk (Western Digital, 1.5 TB) with external power, and it works like a charm: I get hourly backups when I'm home, and the Raspberry is also an excellent file/media server.</p>

<p>I get 23MB/s instead of 30MB/s on the hard disk, but that's still quite good.
I can stream movies off the hard disk (through Samba or MiniDLNA) without problems.</p>

<p>In fact, the hourly backups are done from my laptop using Apple Time Machine, but using <code>rsync</code> shouldn't change much.</p>

<p>As <strong>@goldilocks</strong> mentioned, hard disks without external power (like most 2.5'' hard disk) will require a powered hub: my Raspberry <strong>shuts down</strong> as soon as I try attaching one directly (<strong>edit</strong>: that was with a 5V-1.2A power supply, but still happens when attaching directly with a 5V-2A power supply; a powered hub solves the problem).</p>

<p>In addition, I've installed BarracudaDrive (<a href=""http://barracudadrive.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://barracudadrive.com/</a>), available for free from the PiStore, which I'll use as my personal cloud in the future.</p>

<h2>Hard disk reliability</h2>

<p>The USB HD powers down when not used, but this is implemented by the HD enclosure (most recent ones I bought have this).</p>

<p>Note that spinning down and up is a stress in itself for the hard disk if done too often, but since you can't set the spindown timeout, this is only a problem if the producer chose the wrong setup.</p>

<p>(Google for ""ubuntu destroys hard disk"" to find discussions such as: <a href=""https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Known_issues#Drives_which_perform_frequent_head_unloads_under_Linux"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Known_issues#Drives_which_perform_frequent_head_unloads_under_Linux</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway, you should simply use a reliable USB hard disk designed for your kind of scenarios. Or two ones in mirroring (<strong>edit</strong>: but I would check performance first, since mirroring would double the required USB bandwidth for the same amount of writes).</p>

<p>Instead of mirroring, I carry a rugged hard disk always with me and do backups also there.</p>

<h2>General software setup tips</h2>

<p>Of course, you should pay attention to the filesystem you use on the HD: nowadays ext4 is probably the safest choice since it's easiest to recover it.</p>

<p>You might want to use <code>rdiff-backup</code> instead of <code>rsync</code>, to have access to historic backups.</p>

<p>Finally, since you'll probably do rsync over SSH, you might want to select the RC4 cipher for extra speed (<strong>edit</strong>: but see the warnings about security <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/5198/4395"">in this other answer</a> if you do that over the Internet).

"How can I detect that I'm compiling for Raspberry Pi?","8171","","<p>As Raspberry Pi needs a bit of special code (I'm talking about <code>C/C++</code>) for accessing some hardware features (e.g. a call to <code>bcm_host_init()</code>). I'm looking for a reliable and elegant way to detect this automatically. I don't think there are any compiler <code>#defines</code> such as <code>_WIN32</code> I could abuse, so detecting it from <code>CMake</code> (which can execute shell scripts) would suffice. I'd also like the method to work in most if not all distros.</p>

<p>One way I can think of is that I could look for e.g. <code>/opt/vc/include/bcm_host.h</code> file (which is not difficult), and also check that the architecture is ARM (which is easy at compile time as there are <code>#define</code> macros for that, e.g. <code>__arm__</code> of <code>__ARMEL__</code>). This extra arch check is to prevent false-positives when you have a cross-compiling environment on another machine but are not currently cross-compiling. Is there a different, better way than this?</p>
","<p>Checking at configure/compile time for the <em>features</em> your code depends upon is the way to go. Checking for specific devices is problematic because avoiding false-positives is virtually impossible (someone could lie to you deliberately even with little effort) <em>and</em> the aim of such checks is to answer the question: <em>""can I build here? If yes what code path should I be using?""</em>, not <em>""is this a device I like the name of?""</em></p>

<hr>

<p>According to <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/predef/index.php?title=Architectures#ARM"" rel=""noreferrer"">this reference</a> (a great source of information on predefined macros in general) you can use the macro:</p>

<pre><code>__arm__
</code></pre>

<p>To detect the GCC/Arm combination.</p>

<p>I checked this out on mine with:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
  #ifdef __arm__
  printf(""Why yes it is, thank you\n"");
  #endif
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which did indeed print the message.</p>

<p>Note that this will also catch <em>all</em> Arm devices, so my recommendation would be to use part of your build tool (e.g. <code>cmake/autoconf</code>) to check for the presence of <code>/opt/vc/include/bcm_host.h</code> as well. </p>



<p>For example with <pre><a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.67/html_node/Generic-Headers.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>AC_CHECK_HEADERS</code></a></pre> in autoconf:</p>



<pre><code>AC_CHECK_HEADERS(/opt/vc/include/bcm_host.h)
</code></pre>

<p>causes:</p>



<pre><code>HAVE__OPT_VC_INCLUDE_BCM_HOST_H
</code></pre>

<p>to be defined in config.h</p>

<p>Or for CMake:</p>



<pre><code>include(CheckIncludeFile)
CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE(/opt/vc/include/bcm_host.h BCMHOST)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think there's a better way of detecting this really - you could have configure/CMake look for hardware specific things, but there will be other platforms out there with the same SoC so even that's not really reliable and what you actually care about is the existence of that header file, since that informs you as to how to build for the given target. Even if you can prove it's a Raspberry Pi but can't find the right header file you're still stuck and an error early on is better than a miss-build.</p>

<p>If you really want to check it is a Pi (or sufficiently similar) you can resort to something simple like:</p>

<pre><code>grep -o BCM2708 /proc/cpuinfo
</code></pre>

<p>or (for raspberrypi 2 and 3):</p>

<pre><code>grep -o BCM2709 /proc/cpuinfo
</code></pre>

<p>at configure time, which will match the SoC the Raspberry Pi is based on. </p>

<p>You could throw in a few more tests (e.g. USB will help you figure it out a bit more and even hint if it's a Model A or B device), but nothing is sufficient to say for certain. </p>

<p>You could check the hashes of files in /boot against a known list, but then you won't be able to build if there's a firmware update or an unofficial one you didn't know about. (Or other similar non-Pi devices with the same booting setup)</p>

"USB stick gets very hot","8097","","<p>I have a 32GB, USB 2.0 ICIDU USB stick that I want to connect to my Raspi for storing ownCloud files. The stick is FAT32 formatted, from factory. My Raspi is running ownCloud 6 using this image: <a href=""http://www.owncloudbook.com/owncloud-on-raspberry-pi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.owncloudbook.com/owncloud-on-raspberry-pi/</a></p>

<p>When connecting the stick it gets very warm/hot after only 1 or 2 minutes (just sitting idle). Unfortunately the stick doesn't have an activity light; I can't see if my Raspi is doing anything to it. 
I've hooked up a simple power measuring device and the Raspi consumes 370mA on its own and jumps to 470mA with the USB stick. When the stick is connected to my Windows PC it draws about 90mA, but it does <em>not</em> turn warm, not even a little bit.</p>

<p>So the question is: what could cause the stick to warm up when connected to the Raspi, and what can I do to prevent it?</p>

<p>UPDATE
The stick also gets hot when connected to a Windows PC while files are being copied. It is safe to assume read/write actions cause the stick to heat up. Power consumption rises from 90mA to 140mA during active periods.</p>

<p>I previously had the stick mounted as /var/www to store ownCloud files on it. Mounting the stick in /media/usbstick doesn't cause heat. Somehow Apache2 seems to cause constant read/write activity when the stick is mounted in /var/www</p>

<p>UPDATE 2
Here's what I did to keep temperature down :)
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pae8a.jpg"" alt=""USB stick with heat sink""></p>

<p>The heat sink comes from an old 7805 voltage stabilizer. Surprisingly, it fits exactly. The stick has an aluminium casing, which helps with heat dissipation.</p>
","<p>It is not common for flash drives to get warm but it is not uncommon for USB devices to warm up quite a bit. </p>

<p>It is possible the MCU on the flash drive makes it get hot while you are doing lots of transferring because it has to deal with even wear leveling and smart sectoring.</p>

<p>As long as your device is a legitimate, FCC/ECC/EU approved device then you have nothing to worry about. If you bought it from China of eBay, then it MAY be one of those devices that were not approved, and GREY imported, and those MAY cause serious problems.</p>

<p>Some devices I have used can get to 60 degrees celsius . That is hot to handle but still safe. As long as you are not approaching 80 or 100 degrees celsius  you are OK</p>

"Reduce Ubuntu mate 16.04 img file size","8069","","<p>I downloaded the official <code>ubuntu-mate-16.04.img.xz</code> (which is about 1.1GB) and extracted it. But the extracted <code>.img</code> is about 8.1 GB which is about 162 MB larger than the size of my sd card. So, I can't restore the <code>.img</code> to sd card. In other words Raspberry Pi MATE 16.04 Image is too Large for 8GB sd card</p>

<p>Since the <code>.xz</code> file was so small compared to <code>.img</code>, I suspect that the <code>.img</code> has free space, so I mounted the img and found that there was 4GB free space.</p>

<p>How do I resize the <code>.img</code> to reduce its size so that I can restore it to my sd card?</p>
","<p>Ok so I finally found an answer and I wish to share it with you guys.
My guess is that the creators created the compressed file from an expanded image by mistake.</p>

<p>The fact that the compressed file is nearly 1.1 GB, compared to 8.1 GB of the extracted files, proves this. Empty space will compress to a couple of bytes. If there were additional packages, there would have been a noticeable size disparity between the two images.</p>

<p><strong>Shrinking the image</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ sudo modprobe loop # to enable loopback
$ sudo losetup -f  #request a new loopback device

#This will return the path to a free loopback device.this is /dev/loop0 for me

$ sudo losetup /dev/loop0 ubuntu-mate-16.04-desktop-armhf-raspberry-pi.img
$ sudo partprobe /dev/loop0
$ sudo gparted /dev/loop0

<p>Now a separate window will show up with /dev/loop0 .. you will see two mounted partitions a boot and a root partition.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zOW4o.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zOW4o.png"" alt=""gparted snapshot ""></a></p>

<p>In my case the root partition had about 3.74 GB unused space, so right click on root and click resize and reduce the free space to about 10-20MB then click apply.</p>

"Is there anything I can do to improve boot speed?","8065","","<p>I love my Pi, but it takes a considerable time to boot. If I want to use it as a Media Centre, it's quite important that it powers up quickly.</p>

<p>Are there any steps I can take to improve boot performance?</p>
","<p>Certain things can be disabled that improve boot up speed - swap for instance (my Pi takes ages to activate it.)</p>

<p>However, SD card reads are comparatively slow, and the device itself isn't all that fast - I don't think there's a magic bullet to make it boot up that much faster than by default.</p>

<p>I know it's something you've considered already, but personally I would just leave it on. The two main reasons for not doing so appear to be stability (which could be solved by a cron job reboot every so often if it proves to be an issue at all) and SD card wear. While I don't have any figures on how quickly the latter will take place, there's things you can do to mitigate it (disabling swap) and for the price of SD cards, I'd be tempted to just see what happens. If it dies relatively quickly, you can revisit it and you've not thrown away that much. If it lasts for a couple of years or more (which I highly suspect may well be the case, though I have no benchmarks for that) I think £10 every few years is a rather low maintenance cost in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>As mentioned already the main thing that kills SD cards is lots of writes, and I can't think of anything that would really be doing that (or should be doing that) when the Pi is sitting idle.</p>

When a login shell exits, bash reads and executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes commands from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist.

This may be inhibited by using the --norc option. The --rcfile file option will force bash to read and execute commands from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.

<p>I have looked up the <a href=""http://data.designspark.info/uploads/images/53bc258dc6c0425cb44870b50ab30621"" rel=""nofollow"">exact pin out</a> of the Raspberry Pi B+ and used it to double check that I am getting the pin out correct, considering that most of the tutorials are using RPi model B's. </p>

<p>The libraries I have tried using are the following:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>At first I tried using the one by Stanley Seow, but it had been updated a bit since the tutorial so I was getting function input errors while trying to run the code that comes with the tutorials listed above. I was able to try out the examples included with the library, but none of them worked. Whenever I would run the function <code>radio.printDetails()</code>, I would get an output like the following:</p>

<p>On the Pi, with CE going to GPIO 25 and CSN going to GPIO 8 (CE0)</p>

<pre><code>===============SPI Configuration ====================
CSN Pin      = CEO (PI Hardware Driven)

<p>On the arduino, with the pins quadruple checked and in the right spot I get the same thing, everything is <code>0xff...fff</code></p>

<p>What could be wrong here? I've tried all of the examples included in all of the libraries listed above and everything either gives me the <code>radio.printDetails()</code> output listed above or one with all <code>0x0000</code>'s.</p>
","<p>I finally figured it out. What happened was that when I first got the modules I accidentally hooked them both up to a 5V rail instead of the recommended 3.3V, or at least this is my best guess as to why nothing was working. I got another pair of the RF modules today and made sure to only connect them to 3.3V and they work absolutely perfectly with all of the tutorials listed above.</p>

<p>You've read the accepted answer there wrong.   Ikku is saying if there is a <code>/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf</code>, you have a hard float Raspbian.  I don't think there is even a soft float repo around anymore.</p>

<p>There are two versions of java widely used on GNU/Linux including Raspbian, however.  The default one is <em>usually</em> <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">openJDK</a>, since it is open source.  The other, which <em>usually</em> requires a download from Oracle, is of course Oracle java.  They both follow the same standard and so should be interchangeable version for version, but the Oracle one presumably has more money behind it and not surprisingly thus might generally outperform openJDK -- you'd have to look around, I'd assume various people have benchmarked this online.</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/oracle-java-on-raspberry-pi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the link you included</a>, the Pi Foundation claims Oracle definitely is better on ARM, and hence they are now including Oracle in the repos.  You can check which version you have installed:</p>

"Can I power a Raspberry Pi 3 with a Smart TV's USB-Port?","7924","","<p>We use a Raspberry Pi to display infos on a TV. The content is more or less HTML with some Animations. Currently we use a Pi2 and the power does not seem to be a problem. Recently we came up with the idea of using a Pi3 as it already provides a WLAN module. Now my question:</p>

<p>Does a the USB-Port of a TV supply enough power to run a <em>Raspberry Pi 3</em>?</p>
","<p>According to the Raspberry Pi FAQ on Power requirements <strong>(</strong> which can be found here <strong>--></strong> <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#powerReqs"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#powerReqs</a> <strong>)</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maximum draw from USB = 1.2A</p>
  
  <p>Recommended Power Source = 2.5A</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, according to USB specifications power output for USB works like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>USB 1.x and 2.0 specifications provide a 5 V supply on a single wire
  to power connected USB devices. A unit load is defined as 100 mA in
  USB 2.0, and 150 mA in USB 3.0. And, a device may draw a maximum of 5
  unit loads (500 mA) from a port in USB 2.0; 6 (900 mA) in USB 3.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, that means even if your TV provided USB3 ports that were up to spec you would not be able to deliver enough power to your Pi3.</p>

<p><strong>Short Answer:</strong></p>

<p>You should check your TV's manual to see exactly how much power is being output by it's USB ports, but it is very, very unlikely it will give your Pi3 enough power. <strong>I suggest using an external power source, such as a wall jack with a good power adapter (such as the RAVPower QC 3.0 30W Dual-Port Wall Charger).</strong></p>

"Pi Headless: How to confirm that the Pi is shut down","7897","","<p>I am running my Pi headless connected to my wireless router using a ethernet cable. I wanted to shut down the pi remotely even when I am not connected to it using SSH/Putty to shut it down exclusively.</p>

<p>I put a question here: <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/13423/shutting-down-my-pi-safely"">Shutting down my Pi safely</a> and following the solution provided.</p>

<p>Now is there a way to verify that the Pi is shut down when the router is switched off? Any LED indication possible?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I tried to observe the LED on the attached USB HDD and saw no change (it was already in a standby mode).</p>

<p>I just saw this: <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=72&amp;t=58098"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=72&amp;t=58098</a></p>

<p>Is there anybody in this site who have tried and tested this? I do not have a ready jumper to test it now. But once I do, I shall update this.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Update</strong></p>

<p>I finally stopped working on an implementation to create the indicator to show that the Pi is shut down. This is because, I have trust on the cron and I have checked it visually multiple times. So within two minutes of shutting down the router (<code>eth=down</code>), I see the 10 steady blinking of the ACT LED and the Pi goes to halt. I am so happy. I feel sorry that I had a doubt on my cute Pi!</p>
","<p>Your solution is simple, use an inverter, and a start up script. When The script runs, have an IO pin go high, which will force the LED off. When the OS is off, and the script driving the IO pin is off, the LED will illuminate. </p>

<p>I still haven't made it back to my Pi location, but it may be possible to do this without an inverter. </p>

<p>You would add you script to run by setting up </p>

<pre><code>sudo vim /etc/rc.local
</code></pre>

<p>At the bottom, just above exit 0 we’ll add a call to our script.</p>

<pre><code>python /home/pi/run.py
</code></pre>

<p>Your script would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
pinNum = 8
GPIO.setup(pinNum,GPIO.OUT) 
GPIO.output(pinNum,GPIO.HIGH)
</code></pre>

<p>Indent that last line.</p>

<p>You can see I am assuming the name <code>run.py</code> and that you have a user directory named <code>/home/pi</code></p>

<p>Here is a picture of the schematic.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/90QUV.jpg"" alt=""Invert output""></p>

<p>Now, if you wanted to get a little extra fancy, you could have a green and red LED, one on either side of the inverter. When the OS is on, one led would be driving high the green LED, and low on the  RED LED low. then when the OS were off, the green led would be off, and the red led, on.  (I think that would be neat.) or not. do whatever you like. </p>

"12V device to a Raspberry Pi","7862","","<p>For my school engineering project, I have a coin acceptor device which I would like to link to the Raspberry Pi. However the device requires 12V in power.

<p>Is there anything I can do to get around this? Or is this not likely to happen?</p>

<p>Here's the link to the coin acceptor I'm hoping to use:
<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sintron-Acceptor-Vending-Machine-Message/dp/B00C16P03I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385370033&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coin+acceptor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sintron-Acceptor-Vending-Machine-Message/dp/B00C16P03I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385370033&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coin+acceptor</a></p>
","<p>As I read your question, you need to power the Coin Acceptor using 12v, and reading the output using your RPi.</p>

<p>To power the Coin Acceptor it is best you use an external power supply, as the coil in the acceptor might reset the RPi as it draws a relative large ammount of current when it operates.</p>

<p>Find a 12v power supply, connect <code>-</code> on the PSU to a common ground and <code>+</code> on the PSU to the coin acceptor. That should allow you to configure the coins that should be validated.</p>

<p>I have a similar coin validator, and mine works by connecting the COIN pin to ground or leaving it unconnected (not entirely, it just has a large resistance). Depending on your setting on the switch, COIN is either NC/Normally Closed (default GND) or NO/Normally Open (default not connected). When the acceptor delivers a pulse, the mode switches and you can detect the change using the RPi.</p>

<p>In order to be able to detect the change, you need to drive the COIN pin to a higher voltage, else it will be a voltage comparable to GND at all times.</p>

<p>Wire the COIN pin to the input on the RPi, through a resistor (try 1k ohm).
To pull up (when COIN is on the acceptor is open), wire the 3.3v on the RPi to the input on the RPi (I suggest you use the same resistance).</p>

<p>That will lead to a voltage of ~3.3 v when the contact is open, and a voltage of about half when the contact is closed. If the RPi becomes unstable, you might be drawing too much current, so try to move it up. If the RPi can't detect anything on the pin, try to go with a smaller resistor.</p>

<p><strong>Make sure to measure everything before you connect it to the RPi</strong>, as your coin acceptor might work in a different way. If you can find another 3.3v or 5v source, try to connect instead of 3.3v on the RPi, and measure over GND and the RPi input using a multimeter or oscilloscope.</p>

<p>You can get a really good help with any of this on the electronics stackoverflow - they can help you with wiring and components, so you make sure you don't blow anything up. :-)</p>

<p>First off, using this image:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/image/data/tutorial/raspberry-pi/gpio-pinout.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/image/data/tutorial/raspberry-pi/gpio-pinout.jpg</a></p>

<p>I think I have worked out that I should be doing this:</p>

<pre><code>RPi pin 7 (GPIO 4)   -&gt; RGB LED Common Anode
RPi pin 11 (GPIO 17) -&gt; RGB LED Red -&gt; Resistor -&gt; Ground wire
RPi pin 13 (GPIO 21) -&gt; RGB LED Green -&gt; Resistor -&gt; Ground wire
RPi pin 15 (GPIO 22) -&gt; RGB LED Blue -&gt; Resistor -&gt; Ground wire
RPi pin 6 (Ground)   &lt;- Ground wire
</code></pre>

<p>Given this RGB LED (Common Anode):</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/2128500.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/2128500.pdf</a></p>

<p>It seems the Vf is:</p>

<pre><code>Red: 2V 20mA
Green: 3.5V 20mA
Blue: 3.5V 20mA
</code></pre>

<p>And I'm trying to calculate what resistor I should be using.. My first question is... are the pins on the GPIO 3.3V or 5V?</p>

<p>The main point I'm trying to wrap my brain around is if I'm supposed to subtract the Vf of the LED from the volts provided.  Example:</p>

<p>Assuming the pin output is 3.3V, the Red is Vf of 2V with a current of 20mA, how would I calculate the correct resistance?</p>

<pre><code>3.3V / 0.02A = 165ohms ??
or
(3.3V - 2.0V) / 0.02A = 65ohms ??
</code></pre>

<p>Or, given a 5V GPIO </p>

<pre><code>5.0V / 0.02A = 250ohms ??
or
(5.0V - 2.0V) / 0.02A = 150ohms ??
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, with the Green and Blue.. if they have a 3.5 Vf, and the pin output is only 3.3V, do I need a resistor at all?</p>
","<p>So the answer to my question is actually that using a Common Anode is unnecessarily complicated for the Pi GPIO.</p>

<p>The better way is to use a Common Cathode, and do this:</p>

<pre><code>RPi pin 11 (GPIO 17) -&gt; Resistor -&gt; RGB LED Red
RPi pin 13 (GPIO 21) -&gt; Resistor -&gt; RGB LED Green
RPi pin 15 (GPIO 22) -&gt; Resistor -&gt; RGB LED Blue
RPi pin 6 (Ground)   &lt;- RGB Common Cathode
</code></pre>

<p>As far as calculating the resistor goes, you do need to subtract the forward voltage, but the forward current is not what I expected.  The pi gpio pins output 3.3v 16mA.  And, you need to use a RGB LED with a forward voltage on all pins something lower than 3.3v so it will actually light up.</p>

<li>Red pin resistor: <a href=""http://led.linear1.org/1led.wiz?VS=3.3;VF=2;ID=16"" rel=""nofollow"">http://led.linear1.org/1led.wiz?VS=3.3;VF=2;ID=16</a></li>

</ul>

<p>So the algorithm for a single LED pin is</p>

<pre><code>Min Resistor (ohms) = (3.3V - (Vf of the anode)) / 0.016A
</code></pre>

<p>in this case, for the red pin that is</p>

<pre><code>82 ohms ~= (3.3V - 2.0V) / 0.016A
</code></pre>

<p>Which is confirmed by the links above.  </p>

<p>The ""best"" way would be to use an external power source, and a transistor controled via the GPIO, but I'm lazy and won't be doing that.</p>

2. I have checked other similar questions on this website but they dont have accepted answer or the answer that helps me.</p>

<p>Or How to setup Raspberry Pi without display?</p>
","<p>If you are using NOOBS you need to setup it before use, that means you cannot use it without display on first use.<br>
To solve this problem I am using <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/"" rel=""nofollow"">Raspbian</a>, raspbian by default comes with <code>ssh</code> enabled. All you need to do is download the image and burn it using image writer and you are good to go.</p>

<p>After you burn the image to SD card, insert it into Raspberry Pi and turn it on by connecting the power source (which is, nowadays, a charger of smart-phones), then connect Ethernet port. You need to have a router with DHCP enabled. Now you have to find the IP address of RP, for that, on Linux distribution, you can use <code>zenmap</code> or <code>nmap</code>.<br>
After you know the IP address of RP, you can ssh into it from your computer/laptop</p>

<pre><code>ssh pi@&lt;IP address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>by default, the username is <code>pi</code> and password is <code>raspberry</code>, here IP address will be local IP address starting with either <code>192.168.*.*</code> or <code>10.*.*.*</code> or <code>172.16-31.*.*</code></p>

","<p>What you want to do is possible, but how you're approaching it isn't correct</p>

<p>In order to talk serial over a bluetooth link, you need to use <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/1/rfcomm"" rel=""nofollow"">rfcomm</a> to setup a serial connection. With that in place, you then open the rfcomm /dev/ entry, and a connection is initiated over bluetooth (or an error returned). Finally, you then read and write from the rfcomm device to send and receive your serial data.</p>

<p>If you are only ever going to be talking to a single static Bluetooth device, your best bet is to define the link in <code>/etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf</code> so that the rfcomm device is always created. If you're going to be talking to lots of different devices, you'll need to do something (perhaps using <code>hcitool scan</code> or <code>sdptool browse</code>) to identify the bluetooth address + channel, then use <code>rfcomm bind ....</code> to setup the rfcomm object, and finally connect to that from python.</p>

<p>If you're new to all this, I'd suggest you follow tutorials like <a href=""http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_setup_Bluetooth#Serial_connection_over_Bluetooth"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> or <a href=""http://www.heatxsink.com/entry/how-to-pair-a-bluetooth-device-from-command-line-on-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> to get started.</p>

<p>If you wanted to connect to the Dial Up Networking rfcomm serial service, and there was only one device offering that in range, you'd do something like:</p>

<pre><code>$ hcitool dev
Devices:
hci0    74:AA:BB:CC:80:FF

$ hcitool scan
Scanning ...

$ rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm1 AA:BB:CC:AA:BB:CC 1

# Open /dev/rfcomm1 in python and read/write to it

<p>With that, we scan to find the address of the remote device (must be visible!), we sdp browse to find the rfcomm channel of the remote service, then rfcomm bind to create a /dev/ entry that'll connect us to that channel on that host.

"Default kernel preemption vs real time patch?","7807","","<p>Is the default Raspbian shipped with the real time patch?</p>

<p>I'm using the <code>.config</code> of the default Raspbian installation as a base for a custom kernel compilation. In the section:</p>

<pre><code> &gt;Kernel Features      
  -&gt; Preemption Model (&lt;choice&gt; [=y])
</code></pre>

<p>The selected option is <code>Preemptible Kernel (Low-Latency Desktop)</code>.</p>

<p>The description of the option is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This option reduces the latency of the kernel by making all kernel
  code (that is not executing in a critical section) preemptible.  This
  allows reaction to interactive events by  permitting a low priority
  process to be preempted involuntarily even if it is in kernel mode
  executing a system call and would  otherwise not be about to reach a
  natural preemption point.  This allows applications to run more
  'smoothly' even when the  system is under load, at the cost of
  slightly lower throughput  and a slight runtime overhead to kernel
  code.  </p>
  
  <p>Select this if you are building a kernel for a desktop or  embedded
  system with latency requirements in the milliseconds range.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, when I did some testing, in which I generated a software PWM on the GPIO with the frequency 1kHz, the behaviour was far from real time.</p>

<p>Does kernel preemption mean that rt_patch is included in the kernel?
What else would I gain with the real time patch if the kernel is already preemptive? If the kernel is preemptive, why was the PWM unclean?</p>
","<p>You can check what preempt is currently ""active"" by checking the kernel's configuration from /proc/config.gz:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
</code></pre>

<p>The configuration option for the rt_patch is:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_BASE=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_FULL=y
</code></pre>

<p>Which doesn't seem to be availabe in the stock kernel.</p>

<p>From what I have researched, achievements of the RT_PREEMPT development have been gradually ported into the kernel, and I feel that the PREEMPT is a first-step towards preemption that has appeared. <a href=""https://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Frequently_Asked_Questions"" rel=""nofollow"">RT Kernel wiki</a> states, about CONFIG_PREEMPT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 2.6 Linux kernel has an additional configuration option, CONFIG_PREEMPT, which causes all kernel code outside of spinlock-protected regions and interrupt handlers to be eligible for non-voluntary preemption by higher priority kernel threads. With this option, worst case latency drops to (around) single digit milliseconds, although some device drivers can have interrupt handlers that will introduce latency much worse than that. If a real-time Linux application requires latencies smaller than single-digit milliseconds, use of the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT patch is highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RT_PREEMPT will further break control loops in the kernel, making them preemptiible, and resulting in further lower latencies.</p>

<p>But even the RT_PREEMPT seems only to better the response time by an additional small amount. According to <a href=""https://www.osadl.org/fileadmin/dam/rtlws/12/Brown.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Brown and Martin</a>, the best refence I fould about Real-Time linux, if you need hard real-time you will have to look into Xenomai, or possibly RTAI.</p>

<p>If you want to use the RT_PREEMPT patch, there is a <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=39951"" rel=""nofollow"">thread</a> about it.</p>

<p>First, you'll need to install  <code>curl</code>, <code>git</code>, and <code>build-essential</code> for your operating system. If you don't know how to install software for your system please refer to <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/387/46"">How do I install new software?</a>.</p>

<p>Next you need to download and run the bash script they provide.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
</code></pre>

<p>Next you can do one of two things.</p>

<ol>
<li>Close and reopen your terminal session, or</li>
<li><p>Source the rvm script like so.</p>

<pre><code> $ source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can check if RVM is installed by running the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ type rvm | head -n 1
rvm is a function
</code></pre>

<p>If you get a response like the above one RVM has been loaded and you can install a specific Ruby version. It is recommended that you install the latest stable release; which is Ruby 1.9.3 as of July 11, 2012.</p>

<pre><code>$ rvm install 1.9.3
</code></pre>

<p>Now the final the step is to tell RVM which version to use. In order to use a specific Ruby version for the duration of the current terminal session run the following.</p>

<pre><code>$ rvm use 1.9.3
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use that specific version every time you open a new terminal session though you are going to have to tell RVM to set it as the default Ruby. Like so.</p>

<pre><code>$ rvm use --default 1.9.3
</code></pre>

<p>Congratulations, you have successfully installed RVM on your Raspberry Pi!</p>

","<p>RaZberry uses only four pins: Vcc, Gnd, Tx, Rx. Unfortunatelly, 10 pins are covered by the pinholder, since Vcc and Gnd/Tx/Rx are in different corners, so this is more to keep the board stable on pins.</p>

<p>You can use unused pins just by soldering wires to RaZberry board or by breaking a bit the pinholder of RaZberry, releasing uneeded pins for other applications.</p>

So, basically, for a 10m cable you will be fine if you use 100kHz standard transmission mode. For longer cables you might need to lower your transmission speed, people on the net talk about 100m length clocked at 500Hz.</p>

"How can I change the keyboard layout for the GUI? (console is OK)","7712","","<p>I reinstalled my Raspberry Pi with the latest Raspbian wheezy (<code>2013-05-25-wheezy-raspbian</code>) and modified the console keyboard with <code>raspi-config</code> to match my AZERTY setup. The layout is now OK on the console.</p>

<p>It is still QWERTY on the GUI, though. I tried to find the relevant entry in the menus but I just found how to set speed, sensitivity, etc. - but not the localization.</p>

<p>What is the proper way to set up and AZERTY keyboard on the GUI?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>My Pi is running headless, so I can't test this, but first have a <a href=""http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Change_keyboard_layouts"" rel=""nofollow"">look at this page</a>. Then try if you can set the keymap from a terminal:</p>

<pre><code>setxkbmap fr
</code></pre>

<p>This should switch to french azerty layout. You can put this command into your <code>~/.xinitrc</code> if it works. There are also many other keyboard layouts available (like <code>be</code> for Belgian azerty). </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: If you want to make this permanent, you need to make sure the <code>~/.xinitrc</code> still starts the default WM and desktop. So put these lines into your <code>~/.xinitrc</code>, if it does not exist yet:</p>

<pre><code>setxkbmap fr
. /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
</code></pre>

<p>This will run the default xinit script after setting up the keyboard layout.</p>

"Purpose of "" 127.0.1.1	raspberrypi "" entry in file /etc/hosts","7708","","<p>I was playing with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">/etc/hosts</a> file on my Raspbian installation and outcommented the ""127.0.1.1 raspberry"" line. I know that the host file is basically there to facilitate address look up. However, by doing this, it started giving me following error whenever I try to run a  command with sudo.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>unable to resolve host raspberrypi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, I noticed an abnormal behavior. For example, running <code>df -h</code> when it's been outcommented. It shows my rootfs being full.</p>

<pre><code>pi@raspberrypi ~ $ df -h

<p>While uncommenting it and bringing it back to normal, it makes it normal as follows:</p>

<pre><code>pi@raspberrypi ~ $ df -h

<p>I followed a couple of links, like <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/183176/what-is-the-use-of-etc-hosts"">this</a> and <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;t=49925"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>, but I couldn't figure out <strong>why</strong> it's happening and how removing a host affects applications in general. What is the reason?</p>
","<p>Using <code>127.0.1.1</code> in addition to <code>127.0.0.1</code> is just a Debian convention; <a href=""https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html#_the_hostname_resolution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's the justification</a>. It is not a bad thing. These two addresses amount to the same thing anyway; a more widespread methodology would be to use an alias:</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain raspberry.pi
</code></pre>

<p>But using a distinct address is perhaps a better practice since it would allow you to distinguish one from the other in certain situations.</p>

<p>The purpose of <code>/etc/hosts</code> is described in <code>man 5 hosts</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>whenever I try to run a command with sudo</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For an explanation of why that is, <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/429790/sudo-command-trying-to-search-for-hostname"">see here</a>, which I'll briefly quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The /etc/sudoers file is designed to be able to be distributed among multiple servers. In order to accomplish this, each permission in the file has a host portion. [...] In order for sudo to know whether this rule should be applied, it needs to lookup the host it is running on. It uses a call that relies on the /etc/hosts being correct, which is why it fails if it is not right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how removing host affects applications in general</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applications use networking mechanisms to communicate with each other, and if these are IP based they may use <code>localhost</code> to do this. The loopback interface is conceptual and implemented in the kernel (i.e., it doesn't involve actual network hardware). I don't think that explains your <code>df</code> issue, but if it is consistently reproducible (I could not get the output of <code>df</code> to change by commenting everything in <code>/etc/hosts</code> out) then obviously there's some connection. </p>

"How do I wait for interrupts in different languages?","7708","","<p>I have a IR photo gate sensor that I have attached to my Raspberry Pi, and it is working nicely as I test with WebIOPi and a C program using the wiringPi library.</p>

<p>I would like to use some other languages to access this device while making use of the same kind waitForInterrupt() functionality made available by wiringPi. I haven't found any tutorials that show how to block waiting for an interrupt in Python or (I know this one is a long shot) Erlang.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to do this, or can you point me at instructions? I suppose I could always call out to C code to do that blocking, but I am hoping I can avoid that.</p>

<p>If it helps or you're curious, I am working on a project like this one: <a href=""http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/131</a>, and I don't think a polling approach will give me the kind of results I want.</p>
","<p>In general, you cannot access interrupts directly from a userland program. Those interrupts need to be exposed via some kernel facility to do what you want.</p>

<p>The kernel exports gpio devices as <code>/sys/class/gpio/gpio*</code> devices, and GPIO pins can be exported for userland use. This facility also provides edge triggering for GPIO, and can be configured to trigger an edge either on the rising or falling edge of a signal. This edge triggering is used by <code>poll()</code>:ing the opened gpio device. These are <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/gpio.txt"">documented</a> as part of the kernel. Check for <code>Sysfs Interface for Userspace</code>.</p>

<p><code>poll()</code> can easily be used from both Python and Erlang, but I am not sure if any of the existing Raspberry Pi libraries wrap it in an easy to use manner. However, this is just a simple programming endeavour, and is not specific to the hardware or any of the GPIO internals.</p>

"Addition to cron is not executed","7707","","<p>I am trying to implement a watchdog script which I basically got from <a href=""http://blog.eracc.com/2010/05/08/linux-monitor-a-service-with-a-watchdog-script/comment-page-2/#comment-53857"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Script works fine, starts up process if not running, does nothing if running. Now implementation into crontab gives me headaches!</p>

<p>Opened crontab in leafpad... (what are those leading nubers for? those aren't mentioned anywhere...) so I added */5 * * * * root /path/to/watchdog/script</p>

<p>For my understanding cron should now call up my watchdog script every 5min (on 5, 10, etc.)
But it doesn't.</p>

<p>Help appreciated,
Lars</p>
","<ol>
<li>Be sure that the crontab file is <strong>not</strong> executable or writable by other users.</li>
<li>You should edit the file with <strong>crontab -e</strong> <em>filename</em> rather than with a general purpose editor.</li>
<li>cron needs to be told to re-read crontabs after a modification thereto, with SIGHUP.  I believe (but RTM to be sure) that <strong>crontab -e</strong> will send the signal but if you use another method to edit the file, you'll have to do it yourself with <strong>kill -HUP</strong> <em>PID</em></li>
