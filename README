Local Stack Exchange Explorer (LSEE)
Created 12/28/2018 By Luke Samuel Dupont
Github Repository at: https://github.com/cajuncoder/Local-Stack-Exchange-Explorer


PURPOSE
To provide a local, searchable "dictionary" of StackExchange / StackOverflow questions and answers.
LSEE allows you to:
- Search and browse StackExchange questions and answers offline
- Use a local CLI program rather than having to open a tab in a browser
- Create, search, and view your own custom SQL queries for specific tags


SCOPE
It's my intention to keep this application very simple and easy to understand / modify so as not to impose too much specific structure and keep it accessible to programmers of all levels.
