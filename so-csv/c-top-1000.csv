"How to initialize all members of an array to the same value?","1445269","","<p>I have a large array in C (not C++ if that makes a difference). I want to initialize all members to the same value. I could swear I once knew a simple way to do this. I could use <code>memset()</code> in my case, but isn't there a way to do this that is built right into the C syntax?</p>
","<p>Unless that value is 0 (in which case you can omit some part of the initializer
and the corresponding elements will be initialized to 0), there's no easy way.</p>

<p>Don't overlook the obvious solution, though:</p>

<pre><code>int myArray[10] = { 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 };
</code></pre>

<p>Elements with missing values will be initialized to 0:</p>

<pre><code>int myArray[10] = { 1, 2 }; // initialize to 1,2,0,0,0...
</code></pre>

<p>So this will initialize all elements to 0:</p>

<pre><code>int myArray[10] = { 0 }; // all elements 0
</code></pre>

<p>In C++, an empty initialization list will also initialize every element to 0.
This is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/17589839"">not allowed</a> with C:</p>

<pre><code>int myArray[10] = {}; // all elements 0 in C++
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that objects with static storage duration will initialize to 0 if no
initializer is specified:</p>

<pre><code>static int myArray[10]; // all elements 0
</code></pre>

<p>And that ""0"" doesn't necessarily mean ""all-bits-zero"", so using the above is
better and more portable than memset(). (Floating point values will be
initialized to +0, pointers to null value, etc.)</p>

"How do I determine the size of my array in C?","1156246","","<p>How do I determine the size of my array in C? </p>

<p>That is, the number of elements the array can hold?</p>
","<p>Executive summary:</p>

<pre><code>int a[17];
n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>To determine the size of your array in bytes, you can use the <code>sizeof</code>
operator:</p>

<pre><code>int a[17];
int n = sizeof(a);
</code></pre>

<p>On my computer, ints are 4 bytes long, so n is 68.</p>

<p>To determine the number of elements in the array, we can divide
the total size of the array by the size of the array element.
You could do this with the type, like this:</p>

<pre><code>int a[17];
int n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(int);
</code></pre>

<p>and get the proper answer (68 / 4 = 17), but if the type of
<code>a</code> changed you would have a nasty bug if you forgot to change
the <code>sizeof(int)</code> as well.</p>

<p>So the preferred divisor is <code>sizeof(a[0])</code>, the size of the
zeroeth element of the array.</p>

<pre><code>int a[17];
int n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>Another advantage is that you can now easily parameterize
the array name in a macro and get:</p>

<pre><code>#define NELEMS(x)  (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))

int a[17];
int n = NELEMS(a);

"How do you set, clear, and toggle a single bit?","828117","","<p>How do you set, clear, and toggle a bit in C/C++?</p>
","<h1>Setting a bit</h1>

<p>Use the bitwise OR operator (<code>|</code>) to set a bit.</p>

<pre><code>number |= 1UL &lt;&lt; x;
</code></pre>

<p>That will set bit <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>Use <code>1ULL</code> if <code>number</code> is wider than <code>unsigned long</code>; promotion of <code>1UL &lt;&lt; x</code> doesn't happen until after evaluating <code>1UL &lt;&lt; x</code> where it's UB to shift by more than the width of a <code>long</code>.  The same applies to all the rest of the examples.</p>

<h1>Clearing a bit</h1>

<p>Use the bitwise AND operator (<code>&amp;</code>) to clear a bit.</p>

<pre><code>number &amp;= ~(1UL &lt;&lt; x);
</code></pre>

<p>That will clear bit <code>x</code>. You must invert the bit string with the bitwise NOT operator (<code>~</code>), then AND it.</p>

<h1>Toggling a bit</h1>

<p>The XOR operator (<code>^</code>) can be used to toggle a bit.</p>

<pre><code>number ^= 1UL &lt;&lt; x;
</code></pre>

<p>That will toggle bit <code>x</code>.</p>

<h1>Checking a bit</h1>

<p>You didn't ask for this but I might as well add it.</p>

<p>To check a bit, shift the number x to the right, then bitwise AND it:</p>

<pre><code>bit = (number &gt;&gt; x) &amp; 1U;
</code></pre>

<p>That will put the value of bit <code>x</code> into the variable <code>bit</code>.</p>

<h1>Changing the <em>n</em>th bit to <em>x</em></h1>

<p>Setting the <code>n</code>th bit to either <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> can be achieved with the following on a 2's complement C++ implementation:</p>

<pre><code>number ^= (-x ^ number) &amp; (1UL &lt;&lt; n);
</code></pre>

<p>Bit <code>n</code> will be set if <code>x</code> is <code>1</code>, and cleared if <code>x</code> is <code>0</code>.  If <code>x</code> has some other value, you get garbage.  <code>x = !!x</code> will booleanize it to 0 or 1.</p>

<p>To make this independent of 2's complement negation behaviour (where <code>-1</code> has all bits set, unlike on a 1's complement or sign/magnitude C++ implementation), use unsigned negation.</p>

<pre><code>number ^= (-(unsigned long)x ^ number) &amp; (1UL &lt;&lt; n);
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>unsigned long newbit = !!x;    // also booleanize to force 0 or 1
number ^= (-newbit ^ number) &amp; (1UL &lt;&lt; n);
</code></pre>

<p>It's generally a good idea to use unsigned types for portable bit manipulation.</p>

"How do I concatenate const/literal strings in C?","718485","","<p>I'm working in C, and I have to concatenate a few things.</p>

<p>Right now I have this:</p>

<pre><code>message = strcat(""TEXT "", var);

message2 = strcat(strcat(""TEXT "", foo), strcat("" TEXT "", bar));
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you have experience in C I'm sure you realize that this gives you a segmentation fault when you try to run it. So how do I work around that?</p>
","<p>In C, ""strings"" are just plain <code>char</code> arrays. Therefore, you can't directly concatenate them with other ""strings"". </p>

<p>You can use the <code>strcat</code> function, which appends the string pointed to by <code>src</code> to the end of the string pointed to by <code>dest</code>:</p>

<pre><code>char *strcat(char *dest, const char *src);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstring/strcat.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">example from cplusplus.com</a>:</p>

<pre><code>char str[80];
strcpy(str, ""these "");
strcat(str, ""strings "");
strcat(str, ""are "");
strcat(str, ""concatenated."");
</code></pre>

<p>For the first parameter, you need to provide the destination buffer itself.  The destination buffer must be a char array buffer.  E.g.: <code>char buffer[1024];</code></p>

<p><strong>Make sure</strong> that the first parameter has enough space to store what you're trying to copy into it.  If available to you, it is safer to use functions like: <code>strcpy_s</code> and <code>strcat_s</code> where you explicitly have to specify the size of the destination buffer. </p>

<p><em>Note</em>: A string literal cannot be used as a buffer, since it is a constant. Thus, you always have to allocate a char array for the buffer.</p>

<p>The return value of <code>strcat</code> can simply be ignored, it merely returns the same pointer as was passed in as the first argument. It is there for convenience, and allows you to chain the calls into one line of code:</p>

<pre><code>strcat(strcat(str, foo), bar);
</code></pre>

<p>So your problem could be solved as follows:</p>

<pre><code>char *foo = ""foo"";
char *bar = ""bar"";
char str[80];
strcpy(str, ""TEXT "");
strcat(str, foo);
strcat(str, bar);

"Difference between float and double","682208","","<p>I know, I've read about the difference between double precision and single precision, etc. But they should give the same results on most cases right?</p>

<p>I was solving a problem on a programming contest and there were calculations with floating point numbers that were not really big, so I decided to use float instead of double, and I checked it - I was getting the correct results. But when I send the solution, it said only 1 of 10 tests was correct. I checked again and again, until I found that using float is not the same using double. I put double for the calculations and double for the output, and the program gave the SAME results, but this time it passed all the 10 tests correctly.</p>

<p>I repeat, the output was the SAME, the results were the SAME, but putting float didn't work - only double. The values were not so big too, and the program gave the same results on the same tests both with float and double, but the online judge accepted only the double-provided solution.</p>

<p>Why? What is the difference?</p>
","<p>Huge difference.</p>

<p>As the name implies, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>double</code></a> has 2x the precision of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_precision_floating-point_format"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>float</code></a><sup>[1]</sup>. In general a <code>double</code> has 15 decimal digits of precision, while <code>float</code> has 7.</p>

<p>Here's how the number of digits are calculated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>double</code> has 52 mantissa bits + 1 hidden bit: log(2<sup>53</sup>)÷log(10) = 15.95 digits</p>
  
  <p><code>float</code> has 23 mantissa bits + 1 hidden bit: log(2<sup>24</sup>)÷log(10) = 7.22 digits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This precision loss could lead to truncation errors much easier to float up, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>    float a = 1.f / 81;
    float b = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 729; ++ i)
            b += a;
    printf(""%.7g\n"", b);   // prints 9.000023
</code></pre>

<p>while</p>

<pre><code>    double a = 1.0 / 81;
    double b = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 729; ++ i)
            b += a;
    printf(""%.15g\n"", b);   // prints 8.99999999999996
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the maximum value of float is about <code>3e38</code>, but double is about <code>1.7e308</code>, so using <code>float</code> can hit Infinity much more easily than double for something simple e.g. computing 60 factorial.</p>

<p>Maybe their test case contains these huge numbers which causes your program to fail.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course sometimes even <code>double</code> isn't accurate enough, hence we sometimes have <code>long double</code><sup>[1]</sup> (the above example gives 9.000000000000000066 on Mac), but all floating point types suffer from round-off errors, so if precision is very important (e.g. money processing) you should use <code>int</code> or a fraction class.</p>

<hr>

<p>BTW, don't use <code>+=</code> to sum lots of floating point numbers as the errors accumulate quickly. If you're using Python, use <code>fsum</code>. Otherwise, try to implement the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kahan summation algorithm</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>[1]: The C and C++ standards do not specify the representation of <code>float</code>, <code>double</code> and <code>long double</code>. It is possible that all three are implemented as IEEE double-precision. Nevertheless, for most architectures (gcc, MSVC; x86, x64, ARM) <code>float</code> <em>is</em> indeed a IEEE single-precision floating point number (binary32), and <code>double</code> <em>is</em> a IEEE double-precision floating point number (binary64).</sup></p>

","<p><code>""%f""</code> is the (or at least one) correct format for a double.

<p>Note that this is one place that <code>printf</code> format strings differ substantially from <code>scanf</code> (and <code>fscanf</code>, etc.) format strings. For output, you're passing a <em>value</em>, which will be promoted from <code>float</code> to <code>double</code> when passed as a variadic parameter. For input you're passing a <em>pointer</em>, which is not promoted, so you have to tell <code>scanf</code> whether you want to read a <code>float</code> or a <code>double</code>, so for <code>scanf</code>, <code>%f</code> means you want to read a <code>float</code> and <code>%lf</code> means you want to read a <code>double</code> (and, for what it's worth, for a <code>long double</code>, you use <code>%Lf</code> for either <code>printf</code> or <code>scanf</code>).</p>

The rest of its functions should be made <code>static</code>, so that the user won't be able to access them. This is encapsulation, a good practice.</p>

<p>Quoting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_variable"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the C programming language, static
  is used with global variables and
  functions to set their scope to the
  containing file. In local variables,
  static is used to store the variable
  in the statically allocated memory
  instead of the automatically allocated
  memory. While the language does not
  dictate the implementation of either
  type of memory, statically allocated
  memory is typically reserved in data
  segment of the program at compile
  time, while the automatically
  allocated memory is normally
  implemented as a transient call stack.</p>

<p>And to answer your second question, it's not like in C#.</p>

<p>In C++, however, <code>static</code> is also used to define class attributes (shared between all objects of the same class) and methods. In C there are no classes, so this feature is irrelevant.</p>

"How do function pointers in C work?","635818","","<p>I had some experience lately with function pointers in C.</p>

<p>So going on with the tradition of answering your own questions, I decided to make a small summary of the very basics, for those who need a quick dive-in to the subject.</p>
","<h1>Function pointers in C</h1>

<p>Let's start with a basic function which we will be <em>pointing to</em>:</p>

<pre><code>int addInt(int n, int m) {
    return n+m;
}
</code></pre>

<p>First thing, let's define a pointer to a function which receives 2 <code>int</code>s and returns an <code>int</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int (*functionPtr)(int,int);
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can safely point to our function:</p>

<pre><code>functionPtr = &amp;addInt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have a pointer to the function, let's use it:</p>

<pre><code>int sum = (*functionPtr)(2, 3); // sum == 5
</code></pre>

<p>Passing the pointer to another function is basically the same:</p>

<pre><code>int add2to3(int (*functionPtr)(int, int)) {
    return (*functionPtr)(2, 3);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can use function pointers in return values as well (try to keep up, it gets messy):</p>

<pre><code>// this is a function called functionFactory which receives parameter n
// and returns a pointer to another function which receives two ints
// and it returns another int
int (*functionFactory(int n))(int, int) {
    printf(""Got parameter %d"", n);
    int (*functionPtr)(int,int) = &amp;addInt;
    return functionPtr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But it's much nicer to use a <code>typedef</code>:</p>

<pre><code>typedef int (*myFuncDef)(int, int);
// note that the typedef name is indeed myFuncDef

myFuncDef functionFactory(int n) {
    printf(""Got parameter %d"", n);
    myFuncDef functionPtr = &amp;addInt;
    return functionPtr;
}

<p>In any case, follow the guideline ""prefer <code>++i</code> over <code>i++</code>"" and you won't go wrong.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>extern ""C"" {

","<p>extern ""C"" makes a function-name in C++ have 'C' linkage (compiler does not mangle the name) so that client C code can link to (i.e use) your function using a 'C' compatible header file that contains just the declaration of your function. Your function definition is contained in a binary format (that was compiled by your C++ compiler) that the client 'C' linker will then link to using the 'C' name.</p>

<p>Since C++ has overloading of function names and C does not, the C++ compiler cannot just use the function name as a unique id to link to, so it mangles the name by adding information about the arguments.  A C compiler does not need to mangle the name since you can not overload function names in C.  When you state that a function has extern ""C"" linkage in C++, the C++ compiler does not add argument/parameter type information to the name used for linkage.</p>

<p>Just so you know, you can specify ""C"" linkage to each individual declaration/definition explicitly or use a block to group a sequence of declarations/definitions to have a certain linkage:</p>

  7.17 and 7.18.3).</p>
  
  <p><code>size_t</code>is an unsigned data type
  defined by several C/C++ standards,

  that is defined in <code>stddef.h</code>.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Size_t"" rel=""noreferrer"">1</a> It can
  be further imported by inclusion of

  <p>This type is used to represent the
  size of an object. Library functions
  that take or return sizes expect them
  to be of type or have the return type
  of <code>size_t</code>. Further, the most
  frequently used compiler-based
  operator sizeof should evaluate to a

"typedef struct vs struct definitions","457129","","<p>I'm a beginner in C programming, but I was wondering what's the difference between using typedef when defining a structure versus not using typedef. It seems to me like there's really no difference, they accomplish the same.</p>

<pre><code>struct myStruct{
    int one;
    int two;
};
</code></pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct{
    int one;
    int two;
}myStruct;
</code></pre>
","<p>The common idiom is using both: </p>

<pre><code>typedef struct X { 
    int x; 
} X;
</code></pre>

<p>They are different definitions. To make the discussion clearer I will split the sentence:</p>

<pre><code>struct S { 
    int x; 
};

typedef struct S S;
</code></pre>

<p>In the first line you are defining the identifier <code>S</code> within the struct name space (not in the C++ sense). You can use it and define variables or function arguments of the newly defined type by defining the type of the argument as <code>struct S</code>:</p>

<pre><code>void f( struct S argument ); // struct is required here
</code></pre>

<p>The second line adds a type alias <code>S</code> in the global name space and thus allows you to just write:</p>

<pre><code>void f( S argument ); // struct keyword no longer needed
</code></pre>

<p>Note that since both identifier name spaces are different, defining <code>S</code> both in the structs and global spaces is not an error, as it is not redefining the same identifier, but rather creating a different identifier in a different place.</p>

<p>To make the difference clearer:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct S { 
    int x; 
} T;

void S() { } // correct

//void T() {} // error: symbol T already defined as an alias to 'struct S'
</code></pre>

<p>You can define a function with the same name of the struct as the identifiers are kept in different spaces, but you cannot define a function with the same name as a <code>typedef</code> as those identifiers collide.</p>

<p>In C++, it is slightly different as the rules to locate a symbol have changed subtly. C++ still keeps the two different identifier spaces, but unlike in C, when you only define the symbol within the class identifier space, you are not required to provide the struct/class keyword:</p>

<pre><code> // C++
struct S { 
    int x; 
}; // S defined as a class

void f( S a ); // correct: struct is optional
</code></pre>

<p>What changes are the search rules, not where the identifiers are defined. The compiler will search the global identifier table and after <code>S</code> has not been found it will search for <code>S</code> within the class identifiers.</p>

<p>The code presented before behaves in the same way:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct S { 
    int x; 
} T;

void S() {} // correct [*]

//void T() {} // error: symbol T already defined as an alias to 'struct S'
</code></pre>

<p>After the definition of the <code>S</code> function in the second line, the struct S cannot be resolved automatically by the compiler, and to create an object or define an argument of that type you must fall back to including the <code>struct</code> keyword:</p>

<pre><code>// previous code here...

    S(); 
    struct S s;

"In C, how should I read a text file and print all strings","405039","","<p>I have a text file named <code>test.txt</code></p>

<p>I want to write a C program that can read this file and print the content to the console (assume the file contains only ASCII text).</p>

<p>I don't know how to get the size of my string variable. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>char str[999];
FILE * file;
file = fopen( ""test.txt"" , ""r"");
if (file) {
    while (fscanf(file, ""%s"", str)!=EOF)
        printf(""%s"",str);
    fclose(file);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The size <code>999</code> doesn't work because the string returned by <code>fscanf</code> can be larger than that.  How can I solve this?</p>
","<p>The simplest way is to read a character, and print it right after reading:</p>

<pre><code>int c;
FILE *file;
file = fopen(""test.txt"", ""r"");
if (file) {
    while ((c = getc(file)) != EOF)
        putchar(c);
    fclose(file);
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>c</code> is <code>int</code> above, since <code>EOF</code> is a negative number, and a plain <code>char</code> may be <code>unsigned</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to read the file in chunks, but without dynamic memory allocation, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>#define CHUNK 1024 /* read 1024 bytes at a time */
char buf[CHUNK];
FILE *file;
size_t nread;

file = fopen(""test.txt"", ""r"");
if (file) {
    while ((nread = fread(buf, 1, sizeof buf, file)) &gt; 0)
        fwrite(buf, 1, nread, stdout);
    if (ferror(file)) {
        /* deal with error */
    }
    fclose(file);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The second method above is essentially how you will read a file with a dynamically allocated array:</p>

<pre><code>char *buf = malloc(chunk);

if (buf == NULL) {
    /* deal with malloc() failure */
}

/* otherwise do this.  Note 'chunk' instead of 'sizeof buf' */
while ((nread = fread(buf, 1, chunk, file)) &gt; 0) {
    /* as above */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your method of <code>fscanf()</code> with <code>%s</code> as format loses information about whitespace in the file, so it is not exactly copying a file to <code>stdout</code>.</p>

"What is a segmentation fault?","396242","","<p>What is a segmentation fault? Is it different in C and C++? How are segmentation faults and dangling pointers related?</p>
","<p>Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that “does not belong to you.” It’s a helper mechanism that keeps you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory – accessing variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc. Segmentation fault is essentially the same in most languages that let you mess with the memory management, there is no principial difference between segfaults in C and C++.</p>

<p>There are many ways to get a segfault, at least in the lower-level languages such as C(++). A common way to get a segfault is to dereference a null pointer:</p>

<pre><code>int *p = NULL;
*p = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Another segfault happens when you try to write to a portion of memory that was marked as read-only:</p>

<pre><code>char *str = ""Foo""; // Compiler marks the constant string as read-only
*str = 'b'; // Which means this is illegal and results in a segfault
</code></pre>

<p>Dangling pointer points to a thing that does not exist any more, like here:</p>

<pre><code>char *p = NULL;
{
    char c;
    p = &amp;c;
}
// Now p is dangling
</code></pre>

<p>The pointer <code>p</code> dangles because it points to character variable <code>c</code> that ceased to exist after the block ended. And when you try to dereference dangling pointer (like <code>*p='A'</code>), you would probably get a segfault.</p>

"How do you pass a function as a parameter in C?","394242","","<p>I want to create a function that performs a function passed by parameter on a set of data. How do you pass a function as a parameter in C?</p>
","<p><strong>Declaration</strong></p>

<p>A prototype for a function which takes a function parameter looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>void func ( void (*f)(int) );
</code></pre>

<p>This states that the parameter <code>f</code> will be a pointer to a function which has a <code>void</code> return type and which takes a single <code>int</code> parameter. The following function (<code>print</code>) is an example of a function which could be passed to <code>func</code> as a parameter because it is the proper type:</p>

<pre><code>void print ( int x ) {
  printf(""%d\n"", x);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Function Call</strong></p>

<p>When calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function. Use the function's name (without parentheses) for this:</p>

<pre><code>func(print);
</code></pre>

<p>would call <code>func</code>, passing the print function to it.</p>

<p><strong>Function Body</strong></p>

<p>As with any parameter, func can now use the parameter's name in the function body to access the value of the parameter. Let's say that func will apply the function it is passed to the numbers 0-4. Consider, first, what the loop would look like to call print directly:</p>

<pre><code>for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr &lt; 5 ; ctr++ ) {
  print(ctr);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>func</code>'s parameter declaration says that <code>f</code> is the name for a pointer to the desired function, we recall first that if <code>f</code> is a pointer then <code>*f</code> is the thing that <code>f</code> points to (i.e. the function <code>print</code> in this case). As a result, just replace every occurrence of print in the loop above with <code>*f</code>:</p>

<pre><code>void func ( void (*f)(int) ) {
  for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr &lt; 5 ; ctr++ ) {
    (*f)(ctr);
  }

<pre><code>typedef struct

    char k;
} elem;

</code></pre>

<p>Why is it needed so often? Any specific reason or applicable area?</p>
","<p>As Greg Hewgill said, the typedef means you no longer have to write <code>struct</code> all over the place. That not only saves keystrokes, it also can make the code cleaner since it provides a smidgen more abstraction.</p>

<p>Stuff like</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
  int x, y;
} Point;

Point point_new(int x, int y)
{
  Point a;
  a.x = x;
  a.y = y;
  return a;
}
</code></pre>

<p>becomes cleaner when you don't need to see the ""struct"" keyword all over the place, it looks more as if there really is a type called ""Point"" in your language. Which, after the <code>typedef</code>, is the case I guess.</p>

<p>Also note that while your example (and mine) omitted naming the <code>struct</code>  itself, actually naming it is also useful for when you want to provide an opaque type. Then you'd have code like this in the header, for instance:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct Point Point;

Point * point_new(int x, int y);
</code></pre>

<p>and then provide the <code>struct</code> declaration in the implementation file:</p>

<pre><code>struct Point
{
  int x, y;
};

Point * point_new(int x, int y)
{
  Point *p;
  if((p = malloc(sizeof *p)) != NULL)
  {
    p-&gt;x = x;
    p-&gt;y = y;
  }
  return p;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this latter case, you cannot return the Point by value, since its declaration is hidden from users of the header file. This is a technique used widely in <a href=""http://www.gtk.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GTK+</a>, for instance.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Note that there are also highly-regarded C projects where this use of <code>typedef</code> to hide <code>struct</code> is considered a bad idea, the Linux kernel is probably the most well-known such project. See Chapter 5 of <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#typedefs"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Linux Kernel CodingStyle document</a> for Linus' angry words. :) My point is that the ""should"" in the question is perhaps not set in stone, after all.</p>

"What does ""dereferencing"" a pointer mean?","357660","","<p>Please include an example with the explanation.</p>
","<h2>Reviewing the basic terminology</h2>

<p>It's <em>usually</em> good enough - unless you're programming assembly - to envisage a <strong><em>pointer</em></strong> containing a numeric memory address, with 1 referring to the second byte in the process's memory, 2 the third, 3 the fourth and so on....</p>

<ul>
<li>What happened to 0 and the first byte?  Well, we'll get to that later - see <em>null pointers</em> below.</li>
<li>For a more accurate definition of what pointers store, and how memory and addresses relate, see <em>""More about memory addresses, and why you probably don't need to know""</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you want to access the data/value in the memory that the pointer points to - the contents of the address with that numerical index - then you <strong><em>dereference</em></strong> the pointer.</p>

<p>Different computer languages have different notations to tell the compiler or interpreter that you're now interested in the pointed-to value - I focus below on C and C++.</p>

<h2>A pointer scenario</h2>

<p>Consider in C, given a pointer such as <code>p</code> below...</p>

<pre><code>const char* p = ""abc"";
</code></pre>

<p>...four bytes with the numerical values used to encode the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', and a 0 byte to denote the end of the textual data, are stored somewhere in memory and the numerical address of that data is stored in <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>For example, if the string literal happened to be at address 0x1000 and <code>p</code> a 32-bit pointer at 0x2000, the memory content would be:</p>

<pre><code>Memory Address (hex)    Variable name    Contents
1000                                     'a' == 97 (ASCII)
1001                                     'b' == 98
1002                                     'c' == 99
1003                                     0
...
2000-2003               p                1000 hex
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there is no variable name/identifier for address 0x1000, but we can indirectly refer to the string literal using a pointer storing its address: <code>p</code>.</p>

<h2>Dereferencing the pointer</h2>

<p>To refer to the characters <code>p</code> points to, we dereference <code>p</code> using one of these notations (again, for C):</p>

<pre><code>assert(*p == 'a');  // The first character at address p will be 'a'
assert(p[1] == 'b'); // p[1] actually dereferences a pointer created by adding
                     // p and 1 times the size of the things to which p points:
                     // In this case they're char which are 1 byte in C...
assert(*(p + 1) == 'b');  // Another notation for p[1]
</code></pre>

<p>You can also move pointers through the pointed-to data, dereferencing them as you go:</p>

<pre><code>++p;  // Increment p so it's now 0x1001
assert(*p == 'b');  // p == 0x1001 which is where the 'b' is...
</code></pre>

<p>If you have some data that can be written to, then you can do things like this:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 2;
int* p_x = &amp;x;  // Put the address of the x variable into the pointer p_x
*p_x = 4;       // Change the memory at the address in p_x to be 4
assert(x == 4); // Check x is now 4
</code></pre>

<p>Above, you must have known at compile time that you would need a variable called <code>x</code>, and the code asks the compiler to arrange where it should be stored, ensuring the address will be available via <code>&amp;x</code>.</p>

<h2>Dereferencing and accessing a structure data member</h2>

<p>In C, if you have a variable that is a pointer to a structure with data members, you can access those members using the <code>-&gt;</code> dereferencing operator:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct X { int i_; double d_; } X;
X x;
X* p = &amp;x;
p-&gt;d_ = 3.14159;  // Dereference and access data member x.d_
(*p).d_ *= -1;    // Another equivalent notation for accessing x.d_
</code></pre>

<h2>Multi-byte data types</h2>

<p>To use a pointer, a computer program also needs some insight into the type of data that is being pointed at - if that data type needs more than one byte to represent, then the pointer normally points to the lowest-numbered byte in the data.</p>

<p>So, looking at a slightly more complex example:</p>

<pre><code>double sizes[] = { 10.3, 13.4, 11.2, 19.4 };
double* p = sizes;
assert(p[0] == 10.3);  // Knows to look at all the bytes in the first double value
assert(p[1] == 13.4);  // Actually looks at bytes from address p + 1 * sizeof(double)
                       // (sizeof(double) is almost always eight bytes)
assert(++p);           // Advance p by sizeof(double)
assert(*p == 13.4);    // The double at memory beginning at address p has value 13.4
*(p + 2) = 29.8;       // Change sizes[3] from 19.4 to 29.8
                       // Note: earlier ++p and + 2 here =&gt; sizes[3]
</code></pre>

<h2>Pointers to dynamically allocated memory</h2>

<p>Sometimes you don't know how much memory you'll need until your program is running and sees what data is thrown at it... then you can dynamically allocate memory using <code>malloc</code>. It is common practice to store the address in a pointer...</p>

<pre><code>int* p = malloc(sizeof(int)); // Get some memory somewhere...
*p = 10;            // Dereference the pointer to the memory, then write a value in
fn(*p);             // Call a function, passing it the value at address p
(*p) += 3;          // Change the value, adding 3 to it
free(p);            // Release the memory back to the heap allocation library
</code></pre>

<p>In C++, memory allocation is normally done with the <code>new</code> operator, and deallocation with <code>delete</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int* p = new int(10); // Memory for one int with initial value 10
delete p;

p = new int[10];      // Memory for ten ints with unspecified initial value
delete[] p;

p = new int[10]();    // Memory for ten ints that are value initialised (to 0)
delete[] p;
</code></pre>

<p>See also <em>C++ smart pointers</em> below.</p>

<h2>Losing and leaking addresses</h2>

<p>Often a pointer may be the only indication of where some data or buffer exists in memory. If ongoing use of that data/buffer is needed, or the ability to call <code>free()</code> or <code>delete</code> to avoid leaking the memory, then the programmer must operate on a copy of the pointer...</p>

<pre><code>const char* p = asprintf(""name: %s"", name);  // Common but non-Standard printf-on-heap

// Replace non-printable characters with underscores....
for (const char* q = p; *q; ++q)
    if (!isprint(*q))
        *q = '_';

printf(""%s\n"", p); // Only q was modified
free(p);
</code></pre>

<p>...or carefully orchestrate reversal of any changes...</p>

<pre><code>const size_t n = ...;
p += n;
...
p -= n;  // Restore earlier value...
</code></pre>

<h2>C++ smart pointers</h2>

<p>In C++, it's best practice to use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer"" rel=""noreferrer"">smart pointer</a> objects to store and manage the pointers, automatically deallocating them when the smart pointers' destructors run. Since C++11 the Standard Library provides two, <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>unique_ptr</code></a> for when there's a single owner for an allocated object...</p>

<pre><code>{
    std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; p{new T(42, ""meaning"")};
    call_a_function(p);
    // The function above might throw, so delete here is unreliable, but...

<h2>Null pointers</h2>

<p>In C, <code>NULL</code> and <code>0</code> - and additionally in C++ <code>nullptr</code> - can be used to indicate that a pointer doesn't currently hold the memory address of a variable, and shouldn't be dereferenced or used in pointer arithmetic. For example:</p>

<pre><code>const char* p_filename = NULL; // Or ""= 0"", or ""= nullptr"" in C++
char c;
while ((c = getopt(argc, argv, ""f:"")) != EOF)
    switch (c) {
      case f: p_filename = optarg; break;
    }
if (p_filename)  // Only NULL converts to false
    ...   // Only get here if -f flag specified
</code></pre>

<p>In C and C++, just as inbuilt numeric types don't necessarily default to <code>0</code>, nor <code>bools</code> to <code>false</code>, pointers are not always set to <code>NULL</code>. All these are set to 0/false/NULL when they're <code>static</code> variables or (C++ only) direct or indirect member variables of static objects or their bases, or undergo zero initialisation (e.g. <code>new T();</code> and <code>new T(x, y, z);</code> perform zero-initialisation on T's members including pointers, whereas <code>new T;</code> does not).</p>

<p>Further, when you assign <code>0</code>, <code>NULL</code> and <code>nullptr</code> to a pointer the bits in the pointer are not necessarily all reset: the pointer may not contain ""0"" at the hardware level, or refer to address 0 in your virtual address space. The compiler is allowed to store something else there if it has reason to, but whatever it does - if you come along and compare the pointer to <code>0</code>, <code>NULL</code>, <code>nullptr</code> or another pointer that was assigned any of those, the comparison must work as expected. So, below the source code at the compiler level, ""NULL"" is potentially a bit ""magical"" in the C and C++ languages...</p>

<h2>More about memory addresses, and why you probably don't need to know</h2>

<p>More strictly, initialised pointers store a bit-pattern identifying either <code>NULL</code> or a (often <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_address_space"" rel=""noreferrer"">virtual</a>) memory address.</p>

<p>The simple case is where this is a numeric offset into the process's entire virtual address space; in more complex cases the pointer may be relative to some specific memory area, which the CPU may select based on CPU ""segment"" registers or some manner of segment id encoded in the bit-pattern, and/or looking in different places depending on the machine code instructions using the address.</p>

<p>For example, an <code>int*</code> properly initialised to point to a <code>int</code> variable might - after casting to a <code>float*</code> - access a value in ""GPU"" memory quite distinct from the <code>int</code> variable, then once cast to a function pointer might refer to distinct memory holding the machine opcodes for the function.</p>

<p>3GL programming languages like C and C++ tend to hide this complexity, such that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the compiler gives you a pointer to a variable or function, you can dereference it freely (as long as the variable's not destructed/deallocated meanwhile) and it's the compiler's problem whether e.g. a particular CPU register needs to be restored beforehand, or a distinct machine code instruction used</p></li>
<li><p>If you get a pointer to an element in an array, you can use pointer arithmetic to move anywhere else in the array, or even to form an address one-past-the-end of the array that's legal to compare with other pointers to elements in the array (or that have similarly been moved by pointer arithmetic to the same one-past-the-end value); again in C and C++, it's up to the compiler to ensure this ""just works""</p></li>
<li><p>Specific OS functions for e.g. shared memory mapping may give you pointers, and they'll ""just work"" within the range of addresses that makes sense for them</p></li>
<li><p>Attempts to move legal pointers beyond these boundaries, or to cast arbitrary numbers to pointers, or use pointers cast to unrelated types, typically have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>undefined behaviour</em></a>, so should be avoided in higher level libraries and applications, but code for OSes, device drivers, etc. may need to rely on behaviour left undefined by C or C++, that is never-the-less well defined by their specific hardware.</p></li>

<p>Every program is starting with the <code>main(int argc, char *argv[])</code> definition. </p>

<p>I don't understand what it means. I would be very glad if somebody could explain why we use these arguments if we don't use them in the program? Why not just: <code>int main()</code>?</p>

<p>Is the name of the program one of the elements of <code>*argv[]</code> and <code>argc</code> is the count of the number of arguments in <code>*argv[]</code>? What are the other arguments sent to <code>*argv[]</code>? How do we send them?</p>
","<p>The arguments <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> of <code>main</code> is used as a way to send arguments to a program, the possibly most familiar way is to use the good ol' terminal where an user could type <kbd><code>cat file</code></kbd>. Here the word <code>cat</code> is a program that takes a file and outputs it to standard output (<code>stdout</code>).</p>

<p>The program receives the number of arguments in <code>argc</code> and the vector of arguments in <code>argv</code>, in the above the <strong>arg</strong>ument <strong>c</strong>ount would be two (The program name counts as the first argument) and the <strong>arg</strong>ument <strong>v</strong>ector would contain [<code>cat</code>,<code>file</code>,<em>null</em>]. While the last element being a null-pointer.</p>

<p>Commonly, you would write it like this:</p>

<pre><code>int  // Specifies that type of variable the function returns.
     // main() must return an integer
main ( int argc, char **argv ) {
     // code
     return 0; // Indicates that everything went well.
}
</code></pre>

<p>If your program does not require any arguments, it is equally valid to write a <code>main</code>-function in the following fashion:</p>

<pre><code>int main() {
  // code
  return 0; // Zero indicates success, while any 
  // Non-Zero value indicates a failure/error
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the early versions of the C language, there was no <code>int</code> before <code>main</code> as this was implied. Today, this is considered to be an error.</p>

<p>On <strong>POSIX</strong>-compliant systems (and Windows), there exists the possibility to use a third parameter <code>char **envp</code> which contains a vector of the programs <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>env</strong>ironment  variables</a>. Further variations of the argument list of the <code>main</code> function exists, but I will not detail it here since it is non-standard.</p>

<p>Also, the naming of the variables is a <em>convention</em> and has no actual meaning. It is always a good idea to adhere to this so that you do not confuse others, but it would be equally valid to define <code>main</code> as</p>

<pre><code>int main(int c, char **v, char **e) {
   // code
   return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And for your second question, there are several ways to send arguments to a program. I would recommend you to look at the <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/3/exec"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>exec*()</code>family of functions</a> which is <strong>POSIX</strong>-standard, but it is probably <strong>easier</strong> to just use <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/3/system"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>system</code></a><code>(""command arg1 arg2"")</code>, but the use of <code>system()</code> is usually frowned upon as it is not guaranteed to work on every system. I have not tested it myself; but if there is no <code>bash</code>,<code>zsh</code>, or other shell installed on a *NIX-system, <code>system()</code> will fail.</p>

"strdup() - what does it do in C?","320262","","<p>What is the purpose of the <code>strdup()</code> function in C?</p>
","<p>Exactly what it sounds like (assuming you're used to the abbreviated way in which C and UNIX assigns words), it <strong>duplicates strings</strong>.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind it's actually not part of the ISO C standard itself (it's a POSIX thing), it's effectively doing the same as the following code:</p>

<pre><code>char *strdup (const char *s) {
    char *d = malloc (strlen (s) + 1);   // Space for length plus nul
    if (d == NULL) return NULL;          // No memory
    strcpy (d,s);                        // Copy the characters
    return d;                            // Return the new string
}
</code></pre>

<p>In other words:</p>

<ol>
<li>It tries to allocate enough memory to hold the old string (plus a null character to mark the end of the string).</li>
<li>If the allocation failed, it sets <code>errno</code> to <code>ENOMEM</code> and returns <code>NULL</code> immediately (setting of <code>errno</code> to <code>ENOMEM</code> is something <code>malloc</code> does so we don't need to explicitly do it in our <code>strdup</code>).</li>
<li>Otherwise the allocation worked so we copy the old string to the new string and return the new address (which the caller is responsible for freeing at some point).</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep in mind that's the conceptual definition. Any library writer worth their salary may have provided heavily optimised code targeting the particular processor being used.</p>

<p>If you're part of the crowd that abhors multiple exit points in functions (I don't unless it affects readability, which I don't believe to be the case for such a short function), you can write the code as:</p>

<pre><code>char *strdup (const char *s) {
    char *d = malloc (strlen (s) + 1);   // Allocate memory
    if (d != NULL) strcpy (d,s);         // Copy string if okay
    return d;                            // Return new memory

"Improve INSERT-per-second performance of SQLite?","318742","","<p>Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.</p>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> <em>Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing.</em> It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack&nbsp;Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.</p>

<p><strong>The Experiment:</strong> Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. <em>""Use a transaction!""</em>), I thought it best to write some C code and <em>actually measure</em> the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:</p>

<ul>

<li>My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.</li>
<li>The code is compiled with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Visual C++</a> 2005 as ""Release"" with ""Full Optimization"" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).</li>
<li>I'm using the SQLite ""Amalgamation"", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Let's write some code!</em></p>

<h2>The ""Worst-Case-Scenario""</h2>

<p>We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:</p>

<pre><code>sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')"", sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);
sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<p>This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. <em>How slow?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 9933.61
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only <strong>85 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using a Transaction</h2>

<p>By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    ...

}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 38.03
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to <strong>23,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using a Prepared Statement</h2>

<p>Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code> to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using <code>sqlite3_bind_text</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open input file and import into the database */
cStartClock = clock();

sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)"");
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;stmt, &amp;tail);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t"");   /* Get Route */
    sBR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Branch */
    sVR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Version */
    sST = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Stop Number */
    sVI = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Vehicle */
    sDT = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Date */
    sTM = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);

    sqlite3_step(stmt);

    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

printf(""Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\n"", n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);

sqlite3_finalize(stmt);
sqlite3_close(db);

return 0;

<p>Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call <code>sqlite3_clear_bindings</code> and <code>sqlite3_reset</code>), but we've more than doubled our performance to <strong>53,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF</h2>

<p>By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting <code>synchronous = OFF</code>, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 12.41

</blockquote>

<p>The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to <strong>69,600 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>

<p>Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating <code>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</code>. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 13.50
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little slower than the previous optimization at <strong>64,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF <em>and</em> PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>

<p>Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 12.00
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fantastic! We're able to do <strong>72,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using an In-Memory Database</h2>

<p>Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:</p>

<pre><code>#define DATABASE "":memory:""
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 10.94
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform <strong>79,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Refactoring C Code</h2>

<p>Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra <code>char*</code> assignment operations in the <code>while</code> loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of <code>strtok()</code> directly into <code>sqlite3_bind_text()</code>, and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:</p>

<pre><code>pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */
    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 8.94
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform <strong>96,700 inserts per second.</strong> I think it's safe to say that this is <em>plenty fast</em>. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Summary (so far)</h2>

<p><em>I hope you're still with me!</em> The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go <strong>from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX</h2>

<p>Before we start measuring <code>SELECT</code> performance, we know that we'll be creating indexes. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:</p>

<p><strong>Create Index then Insert Data</strong></p>

<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
...
</code></pre>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Insert Data then Create Index</strong></p>

<pre><code>...
sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 13.66
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. <strong>Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.</p>
","<p>Several tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put inserts/updates in a transaction.</li>
<li>For older versions of SQLite - Consider a less paranoid journal mode (<code>pragma journal_mode</code>). There is <code>NORMAL</code>, and then there <code>OFF</code> which can significantly increase insert speed if you're not too worried about the database possibly getting corrupted if the OS crashes. If your application crashes the data should be fine. Note that in newer versions, the <code>OFF/MEMORY</code> settings are not safe for application level crashes.</li>
<li>Playing with page sizes makes a difference as well (<code>PRAGMA page_size</code>). Having larger page sizes can make reads and writes go a bit faster as larger pages are held in memory. Note that more memory will be used for your database.</li>
<li>If you have indices, consider calling <code>CREATE INDEX</code> after doing all your inserts. This is significantly faster than creating the index and then doing your inserts.</li>
<li>You have to be quite careful if you have concurrent access to SQLite, as the whole database is locked when writes are done, and although multiple readers are possible, writes will be locked out. This has been improved somewhat with the addition of a WAL in newer SQLite versions.</li>
<li>Take advantage of saving space...smaller databases go faster. For instance, if you have key value pairs, try making the key an <code>INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</code> if possible, which will replace the implied unique row number column in the table.</li>
<li>If you are using multiple threads, you can try using the <a href=""http://sqlite.org/c3ref/enable_shared_cache.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">shared page cache</a>, which will allow loaded pages to be shared between threads, which can avoid expensive I/O calls.</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/5431941/6850771"">Don't use <code>!feof(file)</code>!</a></li>

","<p>Read it backwards (as driven by <a href=""http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Clockwise/Spiral Rule</a>)... </p>

<ul>
<li><code>int*</code> - pointer to int</li>
<li><code>int const *</code> - pointer to const int</li>
<li><code>int * const</code> - const pointer to int</li>
<li><code>int const * const</code> - const pointer to const int</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the first const can be on either side of the type so:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>const int *</code> == <code>int const *</code></li>
<li><code>const int * const</code> == <code>int const * const</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to go really crazy you can do things like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>int **</code> - pointer to pointer to int</li>
<li><code>int ** const</code> - a const pointer to a pointer to an int</li>
<li><code>int * const *</code> - a pointer to a const pointer to an int</li>
<li><code>int const **</code> - a pointer to a pointer to a const int</li>
<li><code>int * const * const</code> - a const pointer to a const pointer to an int</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>And to make sure we are clear on the meaning of const</p>

<pre><code>const int* foo;
int *const bar; //note, you actually need to set the pointer 
                //here because you can't change it later ;)
</code></pre>

<p><code>foo</code> is a variable pointer to a constant int. This lets you change what you point to but not the value that you point to. Most often this is seen with cstrings where you have a pointer to a <code>const char</code>. You may change which string you point to but you can't change the content of these strings. This is important when the string itself is in the data segment of a program and shouldn't be changed.</p>

<p><code>bar</code> is a const or fixed pointer to a value that can be changed. This is like a reference without the extra syntactic sugar. Because of this fact, usually you would use a reference where you would use a <code>T* const</code> pointer unless you need to allow null pointers.</p>

"How do you make an array of structs in C?","314555","","<p>I'm trying to make an array of structs where each struct represents a celestial body for the problem that I'm working on in my class.  I don't have that much experience with structs, which is why I decided to try to use them instead of a whole bunch of arrays, however, I keep on running into numerous different errors, even though I've tried to implement the techniques that I've seen on various threads and on stackoverflow (such as at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2575921/array-of-structs-in-c"">Array of structs in C</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4173518/c-initialize-array-of-structs"">C - initialize array of structs</a>), however not all of them were applicable, so I wasn't able to completely copy the way to do it.

<p>Just so you know, <code>n</code> is something that I've legitimately defined (i.e. <code>#define n 1</code>).  </p>

"Initialization of a normal array with one default value","302971","","<p><a href=""http://www.fredosaurus.com/notes-cpp/arrayptr/array-initialization.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">C++ Notes: Array Initialization</a> has a nice list over initialization of arrays. I have a</p>

<p>The code</p>

<p>works just fine and sets each element to 0.</p>

<p>What am I missing here.. Can't one initialize it if the value isn't zero ?</p>

<p>2: Is the default initialization (as above ) faster than the usual loop through the whole array and assign a value or does it do the same thing?</p>
","<p>Using the syntax that you used,</p>

<pre><code>int array[100] = {-1};

<p>says ""set the first element to <code>-1</code> and the rest to <code>0</code>"" since all omitted elements are set to <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>In C++, to set them all to <code>-1</code>, you can use something like <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill_n"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>std::fill_n</code></a> (from <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code>):</p>

"Difference between a Structure and a Union","302963","","<p>Is there any good example to give the difference between a <code>struct</code> and a <code>union</code>?
Basically I know that <code>struct</code> uses all the memory of its member and <code>union</code> uses the largest members memory space. Is there any other OS level difference? </p>
","<p>With a union, you're only supposed to use one of the elements, because they're all stored at the same spot. This makes it useful when you want to store something that could be one of several types. A struct, on the other hand, has a separate memory location for each of its elements and they all can be used at once.</p>

<p>To give a concrete example of their use, I was working on a Scheme interpreter a little while ago and I was essentially overlaying the Scheme data types onto the C data types. This involved storing in a struct an enum indicating the type of value and a union to store that value.</p>

<pre><code>union foo {
  int a;   // can't use both a and b at once
  char b;
} foo;

struct bar {
  int a;   // can use both a and b simultaneously
  char b;
} bar;

union foo x;
x.a = 3; // OK
x.b = 'c'; // NO! this affects the value of x.a!

struct bar y;
y.a = 3; // OK
y.b = 'c'; // OK
</code></pre>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> If you're wondering what setting x.b to 'c' changes the value of x.a to, technically speaking it's undefined. On most modern machines a char is 1 byte and an int is 4 bytes, so giving x.b the value 'c' also gives the first byte of x.a that same value:</p>

<pre><code>union foo x;
x.a = 3;
x.b = 'c';
printf(""%i, %i\n"", x.a, x.b);
</code></pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre><code>99, 99
</code></pre>

<p>Why are the two values the same? Because the last 3 bytes of the int 3 are all zero, so it's also read as 99. If we put in a larger number for x.a, you'll see that this is not always the case:</p>

<pre><code>union foo x;
x.a = 387439;
x.b = 'c';
printf(""%i, %i\n"", x.a, x.b);
</code></pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre><code>387427, 99
</code></pre>

<p>To get a closer look at the actual memory values, let's set and print out the values in hex:</p>

<pre><code>union foo x;
x.a = 0xDEADBEEF;
x.b = 0x22;
printf(""%x, %x\n"", x.a, x.b);
</code></pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre><code>deadbe22, 22
</code></pre>

<p>You can clearly see where the 0x22 overwrote the 0xEF.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong></p>

<p>In C, the order of bytes in an int are <strong>not defined.</strong> This program overwrote the 0xEF with 0x22 on my Mac, but there are other platforms where it would overwrite the 0xDE instead because the order of the bytes that make up the int were reversed. Therefore, when writing a program, you should never rely on the behavior of overwriting specific data in a union because it's not portable.</p>

"What does void mean in C, C++, and C#?","297950","","<p>Looking to get the fundamentals on where the term VOID comes from and why it would be called void. The intention of the question is to assist someone who has no C experience and is suddenly looking at a C-based codebase. </p>
","<p>Basically it means ""nothing"" or ""no type""</p>

<p>There are 3 basic ways that void is used:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Function argument: <code>int myFunc(void)</code>
-- the function takes nothing. </p></li>
<li><p>Function return value: <code>void myFunc(int)</code>
-- the function returns nothing</p></li>
<li><p>Generic data pointer: <code>void* data</code>
-- 'data' is a pointer to data of unknown type, and cannot be dereferenced</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: the <code>void</code> in a function argument is optional in C++, so <code>int myFunc()</code> is exactly the same as <code>int myFunc(void)</code>, and it is left out completely in C#. It is always required for a return value.</p>

","<p>In C, using a previously undeclared function constitutes an implicit declaration of the function.  In an implicit declaration, the return type is <code>int</code> if I recall correctly.  Now, GCC has built-in definitions for some standard functions.  If an implicit declaration does not match the built-in definition, you get this warning.</p>

<p>To fix the problem, you have to declare the functions before using them; normally you do this by including the appropriate header.  I recommend not to use the -fno-builtin-* flags if possible.</p>

<p>Note that this returns the time as a floating point type. This can be more precise than a second (e.g. you measure 4.52 seconds). Precision depends on the architecture; on modern systems you easily get 10ms or lower, but on older Windows machines (from the Win98 era) it was closer to 60ms.</p>

  <p>AceUnit (Advanced C and Embedded Unit) bills itself as a comfortable C code unit test framework. It tries to mimick JUnit 4.x and includes reflection-like capabilities. AceUnit can be used in resource constraint environments, e.g. embedded software development, and importantly it runs fine in environments where you cannot include a single standard header file and cannot invoke a single standard C function from the ANSI / ISO C libraries. It also has a Windows port. It does not use forks to trap signals, although the authors have expressed interest in adding such a feature. See the <a href=""http://aceunit.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">AceUnit homepage</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>GNU Autounit</h3>
  
  <p>Much along the same lines as Check, including forking to run unit tests in a separate address space (in fact, the original author of Check borrowed the idea from GNU Autounit). GNU Autounit uses GLib extensively, which means that linking and such need special options, but this may not be a big problem to you, especially if you are already using GTK or GLib. See the <a href=""http://autounit.tigris.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GNU Autounit homepage</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>cUnit</h3>
  
  <p>Also uses GLib, but does not fork to protect the address space of unit tests.</p>

<h3>HWUT</h3>

<p>HWUT is a general Unit Test tool with great support for C. It can help to create Makefiles, generate massive test cases coded in minimal 'iteration tables', walk along state machines, generate C-stubs and more. The general approach is pretty unique: Verdicts are based on 'good stdout/bad stdout'. The comparison function, though, is flexible. Thus, any type of script may be used for checking. It may be applied to any language that can produce standard output. See <a href=""http://hwut.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">HWUT</a> homepage.</p>

"Typedef function pointer?","279986","","<p>I'm learning how to dynamically load DLL's but what I don't understand is this line</p>

<pre><code>typedef void (*FunctionFunc)();
</code></pre>

<p>I have a few questions. If someone is able answer them I would be grateful.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why is <code>typedef</code> used?</li>
<li>The syntax looks odd; after <code>void</code> should there not be a function name or something? It looks like an anonymous function.</li>
<li>Is a function pointer created to store the memory address of a function?</li>
</ol>

<p>So I'm confused at the moment; can you clarify things for me?</p>
","<p><code>typedef</code> is a language construct that associates a name to a type.<br/>
You use it the same way you would use the original type, for instance</p>

<pre><code>  typedef int myinteger;
  typedef char *mystring;
  typedef void (*myfunc)();
</code></pre>

<p>using them like</p>

<pre><code>  myinteger i;   // is equivalent to    int i;
  mystring s;    // is the same as      char *s;
  myfunc f;      // compile equally as  void (*f)();
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, you could just replace the <em>typedefed</em> name with its definition given above.<br/></p>

<p>The difficulty lies in the pointer to functions syntax and readability in C and C++, and the <code>typedef</code> can improve the readability of such declarations. However, the syntax is appropriate, since functions - unlike other simpler types - may have a return value and parameters, thus the sometimes lengthy and complex declaration of a pointer to function.</p>

<p>The readability may start to be really tricky with pointers to functions arrays, and some other even more indirect flavors.</p>

<p>To answer your three questions</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why is typedef used?</strong>
To ease the reading of the code - especially for pointers to functions, or structure names. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The syntax looks odd (in the pointer to function declaration)</strong>
That syntax is not obvious to read, at least when beginning. Using a <code>typedef</code> declaration instead eases the reading</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is a function pointer created to store the memory address of a function?</strong>
Yes, a function pointer stores the address of a function. This has nothing to do with the <code>typedef</code> construct which only ease the writing/reading of a program ; the compiler just expands the typedef definition before compiling the actual code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>typedef int (*t_somefunc)(int,int);

int product(int u, int v) {
  return u*v;
}

t_somefunc afunc = &amp;product;
...
int x2 = (*afunc)(123, 456); // call product() to calculate 123*456

","<p>There could be many reasons, but the most common are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The port is not open on the destination machine.</p></li>

<li><p>A firewall between the client and server is blocking access (also check local firewalls).</p></li>

","<p>The <strong>do while</strong> loop executes the content of the loop once before checking the condition of the while. </p>

<p>Whereas a <strong>while</strong> loop will check the condition first before executing the content.</p>

<p>In this case you are waiting for user input with scanf(), which will never execute in the <strong>while</strong> loop as wdlen is not initialized and may just contain a garbage value which may be greater than 2.</p>

<p>Another trick is the one mentioned by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/13422/zan-lynx"">Zan</a>, which is to stash the size somewhere.  For example, if you're dynamically allocating the array, allocate a block one int bigger than the one you need, stash the size in the first int, and return ptr+1 as the pointer to the array.  When you need the size, decrement the pointer and peek at the stashed value.  Just remember to free the whole block starting from the beginning, and not just the array.</p>

","<p>You should have a look at <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/libs/python/doc/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Boost.Python</a>. Here is the short introduction taken from their website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Boost Python Library is a framework for interfacing Python and
  C++. It allows you to quickly and seamlessly expose C++ classes
  functions and objects to Python, and vice-versa, using no special
  tools -- just your C++ compiler. It is designed to wrap C++ interfaces
  non-intrusively, so that you should not have to change the C++ code at
  all in order to wrap it, making Boost.Python ideal for exposing
  3rd-party libraries to Python. The library's use of advanced
  metaprogramming techniques simplifies its syntax for users, so that
  wrapping code takes on the look of a kind of declarative interface
  definition language (IDL).</p>

","<p>The return value for <code>main</code> should indicate how the program exited. Normal exit is generally represented by a 0 return value from <code>main</code>. Abnormal termination is usually signalled by a non-zero return but there is no standard for how non-zero codes are interpreted. Also as noted by others, <code>void main()</code> is explicitly prohibited by the C++ standard and shouldn't be used. The valid C++ <code>main</code> signatures are:</p>

<pre><code>int main()
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
</code></pre>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char** argv)
</code></pre>

<p>It's also worth noting that in C++, <code>int main()</code> can be left without a return value at which point it defaults to returning 0. This is also true with a C99 program. Whether return 0 should be omitted or not is open to debate. The range of valid C program main signatures is much greater.  </p>

<p>Also, efficiency is not an issue with the <code>main</code> function. It can only be entered and left once (marking program start and termination) according to the C++ standard. For C, the case is different and re-entering <code>main()</code> is allowed, but should probably be avoided. </p>

","<p>C does not have the support for strings that some other languages have. A string in C is just a pointer to an array of <code>char</code> that is terminated by the first null character. There is no string concatenation operator in C.</p>

<p>Use <code>strcat</code> to concatenate two strings. You could use the following function to do it:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

char* concat(const char *s1, const char *s2)
{
    char *result = malloc(strlen(s1)+strlen(s2)+1);//+1 for the null-terminator

    strcpy(result, s1);
    strcat(result, s2);
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is not the fastest way to do this, but you shouldn't be worrying about that now. Note that the function returns a block of heap allocated memory to the caller and passes on ownership of that memory. It is the responsibility of the caller to <code>free</code> the memory when it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>Call the function like this:</p>

<pre><code>char* s = concat(""derp"", ""herp"");
//do things with s
free(s);//deallocate the string

<p>If you did happen to be bothered by performance then you would want to avoid repeatedly scanning the input buffers looking for the null-terminator.</p>

<pre><code>char* concat(const char *s1, const char *s2)

"Why aren't programs written in Assembly more often?","250277","","<p>It seems to be a mainstream opinion that assembly programming takes longer and is more difficult to program in than a higher level language such as C. Therefore it seems to be recommend or assumed that it is better to write in a higher level language for these reasons and for the reason of better portability.</p>

<p>Recently I've been writing in x86 assembly and it has dawned on me that perhaps these reasons are not really true, except perhaps portability. Perhaps it is more of a matter of familiarity and knowing how to write assembly well. I also noticed that programming in assembly is quite different than programming in an HLL. Perhaps a good and experienced assembly programmer could write programs just as easily and as quickly as an experienced C programmer writing in C.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is because assembly programming is quite different than HLLs, and so requires different thinking, methods and ways, which makes it seem very awkward to program in for the unfamiliar, and so gives it its bad name for writing programs in.</p>

<p>If portability isn't an issue, then really, what would C have over a good assembler such as NASM?</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b>
Just to point out. When you are writing in assembly, you don't have to write just in instruction codes. You can use macros and procedures and your own conventions to make various abstractions to make programs more modular, more maintainable and easier to read. This is where being familiar with how to write good assembly comes in.</p>
","<p>ASM has <strong>poor legibility</strong> and <strong>isn't really maintainable</strong> compared to higher-level languages.</p>

<p>Also, there are many <strong>fewer ASM developers</strong> than for other more popular languages, such as C.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you use a higher-level language and <strong>new ASM instructions become available</strong> (SSE for example), you just need to update your compiler and your old code can easily make use of the new instructions.</p>

<p>What if the next CPU has twice as many registers?</p>

<p>The converse of this question would be: <em>What functionality do compilers provide?</em></p>

<li>Fast! <code>copysign</code> is slow, especially if you need to promote and then narrow again. This is branchless and optimizes excellently</li>
<li>Standards-compliant! The bitshift hack is neat, but only works for some bit representations, and doesn't work when you have an unsigned type. It could be provided as a manual specialization when appropriate.</li>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/822323/how-to-generate-a-random-number-in-c"">How to generate a random number in C?</a></p>

<p>I wish to be able to generate a random number from within a particular range, such as 1 to 6 to mimic the sides of a die.</p>

<p>How would I go about doing this?</p>
","<p>All the answers so far are mathematically wrong.  Returning <code>rand() % N</code> does not uniformly give a number in the range <code>[0, N)</code> unless <code>N</code> divides the length of the interval into which <code>rand()</code> returns (i.e. is a power of 2).  Furthermore, one has no idea whether the moduli of <code>rand()</code> are independent: it's possible that they go <code>0, 1, 2, ...</code>, which is uniform but not very random.  The only assumption it seems reasonable to make is that <code>rand()</code> puts out a Poisson distribution: any two nonoverlapping subintervals of the same size are equally likely and independent.  For a finite set of values, this implies a uniform distribution and also ensures that the values of <code>rand()</code> are nicely scattered.</p>

<p>This means that the only correct way of changing the range of <code>rand()</code> is to divide it into boxes; for example, if <code>RAND_MAX == 11</code> and you want a range of <code>1..6</code>, you should assign <code>{0,1}</code> to 1, <code>{2,3}</code> to 2, and so on.  These are disjoint, equally-sized intervals and thus are uniformly and independently distributed.</p>

<p>The suggestion to use floating-point division is mathematically plausible but suffers from rounding issues in principle.  Perhaps <code>double</code> is high-enough precision to make it work; perhaps not.  I don't know and I don't want to have to figure it out; in any case, the answer is system-dependent.</p>

<p>The correct way is to use integer arithmetic.  That is, you want something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; // For random(), RAND_MAX

// Assumes 0 &lt;= max &lt;= RAND_MAX
// Returns in the closed interval [0, max]
long random_at_most(long max) {
  unsigned long
    // max &lt;= RAND_MAX &lt; ULONG_MAX, so this is okay.
    num_bins = (unsigned long) max + 1,
    num_rand = (unsigned long) RAND_MAX + 1,
    bin_size = num_rand / num_bins,
    defect   = num_rand % num_bins;

  long x;
  do {
   x = random();
  }
  // This is carefully written not to overflow
  while (num_rand - defect &lt;= (unsigned long)x);

  // Truncated division is intentional
  return x/bin_size;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The loop is necessary to get a perfectly uniform distribution.  For example, if you are given random numbers from 0 to 2 and you want only ones from 0 to 1, you just keep pulling until you don't get a 2; it's not hard to check that this gives 0 or 1 with equal probability.  This method is also described in the link that nos gave in their answer, though coded differently.  I'm using <code>random()</code> rather than <code>rand()</code> as it has a better distribution (as noted by the man page for <code>rand()</code>).</p>

<p>If you want to get random values outside the default range <code>[0, RAND_MAX]</code>, then you have to do something tricky.  Perhaps the most expedient is to define a function <code>random_extended()</code> that pulls <code>n</code> bits (using <code>random_at_most()</code>) and returns in <code>[0, 2**n)</code>, and then apply <code>random_at_most()</code> with <code>random_extended()</code> in place of <code>random()</code> (and <code>2**n - 1</code> in place of <code>RAND_MAX</code>) to pull a random value less than <code>2**n</code>, assuming you have a numerical type that can hold such a value.  Finally, of course, you can get values in <code>[min, max]</code> using <code>min + random_at_most(max - min)</code>, including negative values.</p>

"What is the difference between a definition and a declaration?","239982","","<p>The meaning of both eludes me.</p>
","<p>A <strong><em>declaration</em></strong> introduces an identifier and describes its type, be it a type, object, or function. A declaration is <strong><em>what the compiler needs</em></strong> to accept references to that identifier. These are declarations: </p>

<pre><code>extern int bar;
extern int g(int, int);
double f(int, double); // extern can be omitted for function declarations
class foo; // no extern allowed for type declarations
</code></pre>

<p>A <strong><em>definition</em></strong> actually instantiates/implements this identifier. It's <strong><em>what the linker needs</em></strong> in order to link references to those entities. These are definitions corresponding to the above declarations: </p>

<pre><code>int bar;
int g(int lhs, int rhs) {return lhs*rhs;}
double f(int i, double d) {return i+d;}
class foo {};
</code></pre>

<p>A definition can be used in the place of a declaration. </p>

<p>An identifier can be <em>declared</em> as often as you want. Thus, the following is legal in C and C++: </p>

<pre><code>double f(int, double);
double f(int, double);
extern double f(int, double); // the same as the two above
extern double f(int, double);
</code></pre>

<p>However, it must be <em>defined</em> exactly once. If you forget to define something that's been declared and referenced somewhere, then the linker doesn't know what to link references to and complains about a missing symbols. If you define something more than once, then the linker doesn't know <em>which</em> of the definitions to link references to and complains about duplicated symbols. </p>

<hr>

<p>Since the debate what is a class <em>declaration</em> vs. a class <em>definition</em> in C++ keeps coming up (in answers and comments to other questions) , I'll paste a quote from the C++ standard here.<br>
At 3.1/2, C++03 says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A declaration is a definition unless it [...] is a class name declaration [...].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3.1/3 then gives a few examples. Amongst them:</p>

<pre>
[Example: [...]
struct S { int a; int b; }; // defines S, S::a, and S::b [...]
struct S; // declares S
—end example
</pre>

<p>To sum it up: The C++ standard considers <code>struct x;</code> to be a <em>declaration</em> and <code>struct x {};</code> a <em>definition</em>. (In other words, <strong><em>""forward declaration"" a misnomer</em></strong>, since there are no other forms of class declarations in C++.) </p>

<p>What could be the possible reasons for this and how do I rectify it?</p>
","<p>Stack Smashing here is actually caused due to a protection mechanism used by gcc to detect buffer overflow errors. For example in the following snippet:</p>

    gets(array);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)

}

<p>The compiler, (in this case gcc) adds protection variables (called canaries) which have known values. An input string of size greater than 10 causes corruption of this variable resulting in SIGABRT to terminate the program.</p>

<p>To get some insight, you can try disabling this protection of gcc using option  <code> -fno-stack-protector </code> while compiling. In that case you will get a different error, most likely a segmentation fault as you are trying to access an illegal memory location.  Note that <code>-fstack-protector</code> should always be turned on for release builds as it is a security feature.</p>

<p>You can get some information about the point of overflow by running the program with a debugger. Valgrind doesn't work well with stack-related errors, but like a debugger, it may help you pin-point the location and reason for the crash.</p>

<p>This code worked actually. But I cannot explain myself how it works? Because in the while statement, we use <code>getchar() != '\n'</code>, that means read any single character except <code>'\n'</code>? if so, in the input buffer still remains the <code>'\n'</code> character?</p>

  <p>The program will not work properly because at Line 1, when the user presses Enter, it will leave in the input buffer 2 character: Enter key (ASCII code 13) and \n (ASCII code 10).  Therefore, at Line 2, it will read the \n and will not wait for the user to enter a character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The behavior you see at line 2 is correct, but that's not quite the correct explanation.  With text-mode streams, it doesn't matter what line-endings your platform uses (whether carriage return (0x0D) + linefeed (0x0A), a bare CR, or a bare LF).  The C runtime library will take care of that for you: your program will see just <code>'\n'</code> for newlines.</p>

<p>If you typed a character and pressed enter, then that input character would be read by line 1, and then <code>'\n'</code> would be read by line 2.  See <a href=""http://c-faq.com/stdio/scanfc.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">I'm using <code>scanf %c</code> to read a Y/N response, but later input gets skipped.</a> from the comp.lang.c FAQ.</p>

<p>which basically state that the only portable approach is to do:</p>

<pre><code>while ((c = getchar()) != '\n' &amp;&amp; c != EOF) { }
</code></pre>

<p>Your <code>getchar() != '\n'</code> loop works because once you call <code>getchar()</code>, the returned character already has been removed from the input stream.</p>

<p>The advantage of .so (shared object) over .a library is that they are linked during the runtime i.e. after creation of your .o file -o option in gcc. So, if there's any change in .so file, you don't need to recompile your main program.

","<p>Upon further analysis of this, I believe this is (at least partially) caused by data alignment of the four pointers. This will cause some level of cache bank/way conflicts.</p>

<p>If I've guessed correctly on how you are allocating your arrays, they <strong><em>are likely to be aligned to the page line</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This means that all your accesses in each loop will fall on the same cache way. However, Intel processors have had 8-way L1 cache associativity for a while. But in reality, the performance isn't completely uniform. Accessing 4-ways is still slower than say 2-ways.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT : It does in fact look like you are allocating all the arrays separately.</strong>
Usually when such large allocations are requested, the allocator will request fresh pages from the OS. Therefore, there is a high chance that large allocations will appear at the same offset from a page-boundary.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the test code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>int main(){
    const int n = 100000;

#ifdef ALLOCATE_SEPERATE
    double *a1 = (double*)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *b1 = (double*)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *c1 = (double*)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *d1 = (double*)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
#else
    double *a1 = (double*)malloc(n * sizeof(double) * 4);
    double *b1 = a1 + n;
    double *c1 = b1 + n;
    double *d1 = c1 + n;
#endif

    //  Zero the data to prevent any chance of denormals.
    memset(a1,0,n * sizeof(double));
    memset(b1,0,n * sizeof(double));
    memset(c1,0,n * sizeof(double));
    memset(d1,0,n * sizeof(double));

    //  Print the addresses
    cout &lt;&lt; a1 &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; b1 &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; c1 &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; d1 &lt;&lt; endl;

<p>Observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>6.206 seconds</strong> with one loop and <strong>2.116 seconds</strong> with two loops. This reproduces the OP's results exactly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In the first two tests, the arrays are allocated separately.</strong> You'll notice that they all have the same alignment relative to the page.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In the second two tests, the arrays are packed together to break that alignment.</strong> Here you'll notice both loops are faster. Furthermore, the second (double) loop is now the slower one as you would normally expect.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As @Stephen Cannon points out in the comments, there is very likely possibility that this alignment causes <strong><em>false aliasing</em></strong> in the load/store units or the cache. I Googled around for this and found that Intel actually has a hardware counter for <strong><em>partial address aliasing</em></strong> stalls:</p>

<h1>5 Regions - Explanations</h1>

<p><strong>Region 1:</strong></p>

<p>This one is easy. The dataset is so small that the performance is dominated by overhead like looping and branching.</p>

<p><strong>Region 2:</strong></p>

<p><strike>Here, as the data sizes increases, the amount of relative overhead goes down and the performance ""saturates"". Here two loops is slower because it has twice as much loop and branching overhead.</strike></p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly what's going on here... Alignment could still play an effect as Agner Fog mentions <a href=""http://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=142"">cache bank conflicts</a>. (That link is about Sandy Bridge, but the idea should still be applicable to Core 2.)</p>

<p><strong>Region 3:</strong></p>

<p>At this point, the data no longer fits in L1 cache. So performance is capped by the L1 &lt;-> L2 cache bandwidth.</p>

<p><strong>Region 4:</strong></p>

<p>The performance drop in the single-loop is what we are observing. And as mentioned, this is due to the alignment which (most likely) causes <strong><em>false aliasing</em></strong> stalls in the processor load/store units.</p>

<p>However, in order for false aliasing to occur, there must be a large enough stride between the datasets. This is why you don't see this in region 3.</p>

<p><strong>Region 5:</strong></p>

<p>At this point, nothing fits in cache. So you're bound by memory bandwidth.</p>

"What is the ""assert"" function?","208159","","<p>I've been studying OpenCV tutorials and came across the <code>assert</code> function; what does it do?</p>
","<p><code>assert</code> will terminate the program (usually with a message quoting the assert statement) if its argument turns out to be false. It's commonly used during debugging to make the program fail more obviously if an unexpected condition occurs.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>assert(length &gt;= 0);  // die if length is negative.
</code></pre>

<p>You can also add a more informative message to be displayed if it fails like so:</p>

<pre><code>assert(length &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; ""Whoops, length can't possibly be negative! (didn't we just check 10 lines ago?) Tell jsmith"");
</code></pre>

<p>Or else like this:</p>

<pre><code>assert((""Length can't possibly be negative! Tell jsmith"", length &gt;= 0));
</code></pre>

<p>When you're doing a release (non-debug) build, you can also remove the overhead of evaluating <code>assert</code> statements by defining the <code>NDEBUG</code> macro, usually with a compiler switch. The corollary of this is that your program should <em>never</em> rely on the assert macro running.</p>

<pre><code>// BAD
assert(x++);

// GOOD
assert(x);    
x++;

// Watch out! Depends on the function:
assert(foo());

// Here's a safer way:
int ret = foo();
assert(ret);
</code></pre>

<p>From the combination of the program calling abort() and not being guaranteed to do anything, asserts should only be used to test things that the developer has assumed rather than, for example, the user entering a number rather than a letter (which should be handled by other means).</p>

<p>As <code>itoa()</code> is indeed non-standard, as mentioned by several helpful commenters, it is best to use <code>sprintf(target_string,""%d"",source_int)</code> or (better yet, because it's safe from buffer overflows) <code>snprintf(target_string, size_of_target_string_in_bytes, ""%d"", source_int)</code>.

"Printing hexadecimal characters in C","205831","","<p>I'm trying to read in a line of characters, then print out the hexadecimal equivalent of the characters.</p>

<p>For example, if I have a string that is <code>""0xc0 0xc0 abc123""</code>, where the first 2 characters are <code>c0</code> in hex and the remaining characters are <code>abc123</code> in ASCII, then I should get </p>

<pre><code>c0 c0 61 62 63 31 32 33

<p>However, <code>printf</code> using <code>%x</code> gives me</p>

<pre><code>ffffffc0 ffffffc0 61 62 63 31 32 33
</code></pre>

<p>How do I get the output I want without the <code>""ffffff""</code>? And why is it that only c0 (and 80) has the <code>ffffff</code>, but not the other characters?</p>
","<p>You are seeing the <code>ffffff</code> because <code>char</code> is signed on your system. In C, vararg functions such as <code>printf</code> will promote all integers smaller than <code>int</code> to <code>int</code>. Since <code>char</code> is an integer (8-bit signed integer in your case), your chars are being promoted to <code>int</code> via sign-extension.</p>

<p>Since <code>c0</code> and <code>80</code> have a leading 1-bit (and are negative as an 8-bit integer), they are being sign-extended while the others in your sample don't.</p>

<pre><code>char    int
c0 -&gt; ffffffc0
80 -&gt; ffffff80
61 -&gt; 00000061
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a solution:</p>

<pre><code>char ch = 0xC0;
printf(""%x"", ch &amp; 0xff);

"Going through a text file line by line in C","204661","","<p>I have been working on a small exercise for my CIS class and am very confused by the methods C uses to read from a file. All that I really need to do is read through a file line by line and use the information gathered from each line to do a few manipulations. I tried using the getline method and others with no luck. 
My code is currently as follows:</p>

<pre><code>int main(char *argc, char* argv[]){
      const char *filename = argv[0];
      FILE *file = fopen(filename, ""r"");
      char *line = NULL;

        sscanf(line, filename, ""%s"");
        printf(""%s\n"", line);
      }
    return 1;
}

<p>Right now I am getting a seg fault with the sscanf method and I am not sure why. I am a total C noob and just wondering if there was some big picture thing that I was missing. 
Thanks</p>
","<p>So many problems in so few lines. I probably forget some:</p>

<ul>
<li>argv[0] is the program name, not the first argument;</li>
<li>if you want to read in a variable, you have to allocate its memory</li>
<li>one never loops on feof, one loops on an IO function until it fails, feof then serves to determinate the reason of failure,</li>
<li>sscanf is there to parse a line, if you want to parse a file, use fscanf,</li>
<li>""%s"" will stop at the first space as a format for the ?scanf family</li>
<li>to read a line, the standard function is fgets,</li>
<li>returning 1 from main means failure</li>
</ul>

<p>So</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    char const* const fileName = argv[1]; /* should check that argc &gt; 1 */
    FILE* file = fopen(fileName, ""r""); /* should check the result */
    char line[256];

    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file)) {

"How to compile C programming in Windows 7?","204372","","<p>I am looking for free tools to compile C programs on Windows 7. I've always compiled C code on Ubuntu using gcc in the past. So, how can I compile C code on Windows 7? Please teach me. :)</p>
","<p><strong><a href=""http://www.mingw.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">MinGW</a></strong> uses a fairly old version of GCC (3.4.5, I believe), and hasn't been updated in a while. If you're already comfortable with the GCC toolset and just looking to get your feet wet in Windows programming, this may be a good option for you. There are lots of great IDEs available that use this compiler.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Apparently I was wrong; that's what I get for talking about something I know very little about. Tauran points out that there is a project that aims to provide the MinGW toolkit with the current version of GCC. You can download it from <a href=""http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">their website</a>.</p>

<p><br>
However, I'm not sure that I can recommend it for serious Windows development. If you're not a idealistic fanboy who can't stomach the notion of ever using Microsoft software, I <em>highly</em> recommend investigating <strong>Visual Studio</strong>, which comes bundled with Microsoft's C/C++ compiler. The <strong><a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP"" rel=""noreferrer"">Express version</a></strong> (which includes the same compiler as all the paid-for editions) is absolutely free for download. In addition to the compiler, Visual Studio also provides a world-class IDE that makes developing Windows-specific applications much easier. Yes, detractors will ramble on about the fact that it's not fully standards-compliant, but such is the world of writing Windows applications. They're never going to be truly portable once you include <code>windows.h</code>, so most of the idealistic dedication just ends up being a waste of time.</p>

"How to code a modulo (%) operator in C/C++/Obj-C that handles negative numbers","204207","","<p>One of my pet hates of C-derived languages (as a mathematician)  is that</p>

<pre><code>(-1) % 8 // comes out as -1, and not 7

fmodf(-1,8) // fails similarly
</code></pre>

<p>What's the best solution?  </p>

<p>C++ allows the possibility of templates and operator overloading, but both of these are murky waters for me. examples gratefully received.</p>
","<p>First of all I'd like to note that you cannot even rely on the fact that <code>(-1) % 8 == -1</code>. the only thing you can rely on is that <code>(x / y) * y + ( x % y) == x</code>. However whether or not the remainder is negative is <em>implementation-defined</em>. </p>

<p>Now why use templates here? An overload for ints and longs would do.</p>

<pre><code>int mod (int a, int b)
{
   int ret = a % b;
   if(ret &lt; 0)
     ret+=b;
   return ret;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and now you can call it like mod(-1,8) and it will appear to be 7. </p>

<p>Edit: I found a bug in my code. It won't work if b is negative. So I think this is better:</p>

<pre><code>int mod (int a, int b)
{
   if(b &lt; 0) //you can check for b == 0 separately and do what you want
     return mod(a, -b);   
   int ret = a % b;
   if(ret &lt; 0)
     ret+=b;
   return ret;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Reference: C++03 paragraph 5.6 clause 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The binary / operator yields the quotient, and the binary % operator yields the remainder from the division of the first expression by the second. If the second operand of / or % is zero the behavior is undefined; otherwise (a/b)*b + a%b is equal to a. If both operands are nonnegative then the remainder is nonnegative; <strong><em>if not, the sign of the remainder is implementation-defined</em></strong>.</p>

"End of File (EOF) in C","203774","","<p>I am currently reading the book C Programming Language by Ritchie &amp; Kernighan. And I am pretty confused about the usage of EOF in the <code>getchar()</code> function. </p>

<p>First, I want to know why the value of EOF is -1 and why the value of <code>getchar()!=EOF</code> is 0. Pardon me for my question but I really don't understand. I really tried but I can't. </p>

<p>Then I tried to run the example on the book that can count the number of characters using the code below but it seems that I never get out of the loop even if I press enter so I am wondering when would I reach the EOF?</p>

<pre><code>main(){
   long nc;
   nc = 0;
   while (getchar() != EOF)
       ++nc;
   printf(""%ld\n"", nc);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I read the same problem at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1622092/problem-with-eof-in-c"">Problem with EOF in C</a>. Most people advised that instead of using EOF, use the terminator \n or the null terminator '\0' which makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Does it mean that the example on the book serves another purpose? </p>
","<p>EOF indicates ""end of file"". A newline (which is what happens when you press enter) isn't the end of a <em>file</em>, it's the end of a <em>line</em>, so a newline doesn't terminate this loop.</p>

<p>The code isn't wrong[*], it just doesn't do what you seem to expect. It reads to the end of the input, but you seem to want to read only to the end of a line.</p>

<p>The value of EOF is -1 because it has to be different from any return value from <code>getchar</code> that is an actual character. So <code>getchar</code> returns any character value as an unsigned char, converted to int, which will therefore be non-negative.</p>

<p>If you're typing at the terminal and you want to provoke an end-of-file, use CTRL-D (unix-style systems) or CTRL-Z (Windows). Then after all the input has been read, <code>getchar()</code> will return <code>EOF</code>, and hence <code>getchar() != EOF</code> will be false, and the loop will terminate.</p>

<p>[*] well, it has undefined behavior if the input is more than LONG_MAX characters due to integer overflow, but we can probably forgive that in a simple example.</p>

"Difference between static memory allocation and dynamic memory allocation","196337","","<p>I would like to know what is the difference between static memory allocation and dynamic memory allocation?</p>

<p>Could you explain this with any example?</p>
","<p>There are three types of allocation — static, automatic, and dynamic.</p>

<p><strong>Static Allocation</strong> means, that the memory for your variables is allocated when the program starts.  The size is fixed when the program is created.  It applies to global variables, file scope variables, and variables qualified with <code>static</code> defined inside functions.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic memory allocation</strong> occurs for (non-static) variables defined inside functions, and is usually stored on the <em>stack</em> (though the C standard doesn't mandate that a stack is used). You do not have to reserve extra memory using them, but on the other hand, have also limited control over the lifetime of this memory. E.g: automatic variables in a function are only there until the function finishes.</p>

<pre><code>void func() {
    int i; /* `i` only exists during `func` */
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Dynamic memory allocation</strong> is a bit different. You now control the exact size and the lifetime of these memory locations. If you don't free it, you'll run into memory leaks, which may cause your application to crash, since at some point of time, system cannot allocate more memory.</p>

<pre><code>int* func() {
    int* mem = malloc(1024);
    return mem;
}

int* mem = func(); /* still accessible */
</code></pre>

<p>In the upper example, the allocated memory is still valid and accessible, even though the function terminated. When you are done with the memory, you have to free it:</p>

<pre><code>free(mem);

","<p>Arrays decay to pointers in function calls. It's not possible to compute the size of an array which is only represented as a pointer in any way, including using <code>sizeof</code>.</p>

<p>You must add an explicit argument:</p>

<pre><code>void show(int *data, size_t count);

<p>In the call, you can use <code>sizeof</code> to compute the number of elements, for actual arrays:</p>

<pre><code>int arr[] = { 1,2,3,4,5 };

show(arr, sizeof arr / sizeof *arr);

<p>Note that <code>sizeof</code> gives you the size in units of <code>char</code>, which is why the division by what is essentially <code>sizeof (int)</code> is needed, or you'd get a way too high value.</p>

<p>Also note, as a point of interest and cleanliness, that <code>sizeof</code> is <em>not</em>  a function. The parentheses are only needed when the argument is a type name, since the argument then is a cast-like expression (e.g. <code>sizeof (int)</code>). You can often get away without naming actual types, by doing <code>sizeof</code> on data instead.</p>

<h2>Null Pointers</h2>

<p>The integer constant literal <code>0</code> has different meanings depending upon the context in which it's used. In all cases, it is still an integer constant with the value <code>0</code>, it is just described in different ways.</p>

<p>If a pointer is being compared to the constant literal <code>0</code>, then this is a check to see if the pointer is a null pointer. This <code>0</code> is then referred to as a null pointer constant. The C standard defines that <code>0</code> cast to the type <code>void *</code> is both a null pointer and a null pointer constant.</p>

<p>Additionally, to help readability, the macro <code>NULL</code> is provided in the header file <code>stddef.h</code>. Depending upon your compiler it might be possible to <code>#undef NULL</code> and redefine it to something wacky.</p>

<p>Therefore, here are some valid ways to check for a null pointer:</p>

<pre><code>if (pointer == NULL)
</code></pre>

<p><code>NULL</code> is defined to compare equal to a null pointer.  It is implementation defined what the actual definition of <code>NULL</code> is, as long as it is a valid null pointer constant.</p>

<pre><code>if (pointer == 0)
</code></pre>

<p><code>0</code> is another representation of the null pointer constant.</p>

<pre><code>if (!pointer)
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>if</code> statement implicitly checks ""is not 0"", so we reverse that to mean ""is 0"".</p>

<p>The following are INVALID ways to check for a null pointer:</p>

<pre><code>int mynull = 0;
&lt;some code&gt;
if (pointer == mynull)
</code></pre>

<p>To the compiler this is not a check for a null pointer, but an equality check on two variables. This <em>might</em> work if mynull never changes in the code and the compiler optimizations constant fold the 0 into the if statement, but this is not guaranteed and the compiler has to produce at least one diagnostic message (warning or error) according to the C Standard.</p>

<p>Note that what is a null pointer in the C language. It does not matter on the underlying architecture. If the underlying architecture has a null pointer value defined as address 0xDEADBEEF, then it is up to the compiler to sort this mess out.</p>

<p>As such, even on this funny architecture, the following ways are still valid ways to check for a null pointer:</p>

<pre><code>if (!pointer)
if (pointer == NULL)
if (pointer == 0)
</code></pre>

<p>The following are INVALID ways to check for a null pointer:</p>

<pre><code>#define MYNULL (void *) 0xDEADBEEF
if (pointer == MYNULL)
if (pointer == 0xDEADBEEF)
</code></pre>

<p>as these are seen by a compiler as normal comparisons. </p>

<h2>Null Characters</h2>

<p><code>'\0'</code> is defined to be a null character - that is a character with all bits set to zero. This has nothing to do with pointers. However you may see something similar to this code:</p>

<pre><code>if (!*string_pointer)
</code></pre>

<p>checks if the string pointer is pointing at a null character</p>

<pre><code>if (*string_pointer)
</code></pre>

<p>checks if the string pointer is pointing at a non-null character</p>

<p>Don't get these confused with null pointers. Just because the bit representation is the same, and this allows for some convenient cross over cases, they are not really the same thing. </p>

<p>Additionally, <code>'\0'</code> is (like all character literals) an integer constant, in this case with the value zero.  So <code>'\0'</code> is completely equivalent to an unadorned <code>0</code> integer constant - the only difference is in the <em>intent</em> that it conveys to a human reader (""I'm using this as a null character."").</p>

<p>Depending on the command arguments, a new process is kicked off with <code>fork()</code> and that process needs to read and modify the <strong>current_path</strong> variable stored in shared memory while the <strong>file_name</strong> variable is read only.</p>

<p>Is there a good tutorial on shared memory with example code (if possible) that you can direct me to?</p>

<p>Thanks,
bleepzter</p>
","<p>There are two approaches: <code>shmget</code> and <code>mmap</code>. I'll talk about <code>mmap</code>, since it's more modern and flexible, but you can take a look at <code>man shmget</code> (<a href=""http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node27.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">or this tutorial</a>) if you'd rather use the old-style tools.</p>

<p>The <code>mmap()</code> function can be used to allocate memory buffers with highly customizable parameters to control access and permissions, and to back them with file-system storage if necessary.</p>

<p>The following function creates an in-memory buffer that a process can share with its children:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

void* create_shared_memory(size_t size) {
  // Our memory buffer will be readable and writable:
  int protection = PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE;

  // The buffer will be shared (meaning other processes can access it), but
  // anonymous (meaning third-party processes cannot obtain an address for it),
  // so only this process and its children will be able to use it:
  int visibility = MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_SHARED;

  // The remaining parameters to `mmap()` are not important for this use case,
  // but the manpage for `mmap` explains their purpose.
  return mmap(NULL, size, protection, visibility, 0, 0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The following is an example program that uses the function defined above to allocate a buffer. The parent process will write a message, fork, and then wait for its child to modify the buffer. Both processes can read and write the shared memory.</p>

#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main() {
  char* parent_message = ""hello"";  // parent process will write this message
  char* child_message = ""goodbye""; // child process will then write this one

  <p><code>nanosleep()</code> suspends the execution of the calling thread until either at least the time specified in <code>*req</code> has elapsed, or the
  delivery of a signal that triggers the invocation of a handler in the
  calling thread or that terminates the process.</p>

"Use of min and max functions in C++","192180","","<p>From C++, are <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> preferable over <code>fmin</code> and <code>fmax</code>?  For comparing two integers, do they provide basically the same functionality? </p>

<p>Do you tend to use one of these sets of functions or do you prefer to write your own (perhaps to improve efficiency, portability, flexibility, etc.)?</p>

<p><strong><em>Notes:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) declares the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> functions in the standard C++ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_(C%2B%2B)"" rel=""noreferrer"">algorithm</a> header.  </p></li>
<li><p>The C standard (C99) provides the <code>fmin</code> and <code>fmax</code> function in the standard C <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math.h"" rel=""noreferrer"">math.h</a> header.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p><code>fmin</code> and <code>fmax</code> are specifically for use with floating point numbers (hence the ""f""). If you use it for ints, you may suffer performance or precision losses due to conversion, function call overhead, etc. depending on your compiler/platform.</p>

<p><code>std::min</code> and <code>std::max</code> are template functions (defined in header <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/algorithm"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code></a>) which work on any type with a less-than (<code>&lt;</code>) operator, so they can operate on any data type that allows such a comparison. You can also provide your own comparison function if you don't want it to work off <code>&lt;</code>.</p>

<p>This is safer since you have to explicitly convert arguments to match when they have different types. The compiler won't let you accidentally convert a 64-bit int into a 64-bit float, for example. This reason alone should make the templates your default choice. (Credit to Matthieu M &amp; bk1e)</p>

<p>Even when used with floats the template <strong><em>may</em></strong> win in performance. A compiler always has the option of inlining calls to template functions since the source code is part of the compilation unit. Sometimes it's <em>impossible</em> to inline a call to a library function, on the other hand (shared libraries, absence of link-time optimization, etc.).</p>

unsigned int r = v &amp; 1; // r will be reversed bits of v; first get LSB of v
int s = sizeof(v) * CHAR_BIT - 1; // extra shift needed at end

for (v &gt;&gt;= 1; v; v &gt;&gt;= 1)

  r &lt;&lt;= 1;
  r |= v &amp; 1;
  s--;

r &lt;&lt;= s; // shift when v's highest bits are zero

b = ((b * 0x0802LU &amp; 0x22110LU) | (b * 0x8020LU &amp; 0x88440LU)) * 0x10101LU &gt;&gt; 16;

<p><strong>Faster (64-bit processor)</strong></p>

b = (b * 0x0202020202ULL &amp; 0x010884422010ULL) % 1023;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to do this on a 32-bit <code>int</code>, just reverse the bits in each bytes, and reverse the order of the bytes.  That is:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned int toReverse;
unsigned int reversed;
unsigned char inByte0 = (toReverse &amp; 0xFF);
unsigned char inByte1 = (toReverse &amp; 0xFF00) &gt;&gt; 8;
unsigned char inByte2 = (toReverse &amp; 0xFF0000) &gt;&gt; 16;
unsigned char inByte3 = (toReverse &amp; 0xFF000000) &gt;&gt; 24;
reversed = (reverseBits(inByte0) &lt;&lt; 24) | (reverseBits(inByte1) &lt;&lt; 16) | (reverseBits(inByte2) &lt;&lt; 8) | (reverseBits(inByte3);

<p>I benchmarked the two most promising solutions, the lookup table, and bitwise-AND (the first one).  The test machine is a laptop w/ 4GB of DDR2-800 and a Core 2 Duo T7500 @ 2.4GHz, 4MB L2 Cache; YMMV.  I used <em>gcc</em> 4.3.2 on 64-bit Linux.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><strong>Use the lookup table, with option 1</strong> (byte addressing is unsurprisingly slow) if you're concerned about performance.  If you need to squeeze every last byte of memory out of your system (and you might, if you care about the performance of bit reversal), the optimized versions of the bitwise-AND approach aren't too shabby either.</p>

<h2>Caveat</h2>

<p>Yes, I know the benchmark code is a complete hack.  Suggestions on how to improve it are more than welcome.  Things I know about:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't have access to ICC.  This may be faster (please respond in a comment if you can test this out).</li>
<li>A 64K lookup table may do well on some modern microarchitectures with large L1D.</li>
<li>-mtune=native didn't work for -O2/-O3 (<code>ld</code> blew up with some crazy symbol redefinition error), so I don't believe the generated code is tuned for my microarchitecture.</li>
<li>There may be a way to do this slightly faster with SSE.  I have no idea how, but with fast replication, packed bitwise AND, and swizzling instructions, there's got to be something there.</li>
<li>I know only enough x86 assembly to be dangerous; here's the code GCC generated on -O3 for option 1, so somebody more knowledgable than myself can check it out:</li>
</ul>

<p>While it is defined in point.c.</p>

<p>This is a separate file called <strong>testpoint.c</strong>:</p>

int main() {
  double x = 1;
  double y = 1;
  Point p = create(x, y);

  assert(p.x == 1);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm at a loss as to what the issue could be.</p>
","<p>How are you doing the compiling and linking? You'll need to specify both files, something like:</p>

<pre><code>gcc testpoint.c point.c
</code></pre>

<p>...so that it knows to link the functions from both together. With the code as it's written right now, however, you'll then run into the opposite problem: multiple definitions of <code>main</code>. You'll need/want to eliminate one (undoubtedly the one in point.c).</p>

<p>Edit: In a larger program, you typically compile and link separately to avoid re-compiling anything that hasn't changed. You normally specify what needs to be done via a makefile, and use <code>make</code> to do the work. In this case you'd have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>OBJS=testpoint.o point.o

testpoint.exe: $(OBJS)
    gcc $(OJBS)
</code></pre>

<p>The first is just a macro for the names of the object files. You get is expanded with <code>$(OBJS)</code>. The second is a rule to tell make 1) that the executable depends on the object files, and 2) telling it how to create the executable when/if it's out of date compared to an object file.</p>

<p>Most versions of make (including the one in MinGW I'm pretty sure) have a built-in ""implicit rule"" to tell them how to create an object file from a C source file. It normally looks roughly like this:</p>

<pre><code>.c.o:
    $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes the name of the C compiler is in a macro named CC (implicitly defined like <code>CC=gcc</code>) and allows you to specify any flags you care about in a macro named <code>CFLAGS</code> (e.g., <code>CFLAGS=-O3</code> to turn on optimization) and <code>$&lt;</code> is a special macro that expands to the name of the source file.</p>

<p>You typically store this in a file named <code>Makefile</code>, and to build your program, you just type <code>make</code> at the command line. It implicitly looks for a file named <code>Makefile</code>, and runs whatever rules it contains.</p>

<p>The good point of this is that <code>make</code> automatically looks at the timestamps on the files, so it will only re-compile the files that have changed since the last time you compiled them (i.e., files where the "".c"" file has a more recent time-stamp than the matching "".o"" file).</p>

<p>Also note that 1) there are lots of variations in how to use make when it comes to large projects, and 2) there are also lots of alternatives to make. I've only hit on the bare minimum of high points here.</p>

"How to correctly use the extern keyword in C","191097","","<p>My question is about when a function should be referenced with the <code>extern</code> keyword in C.</p>

<p>I am failing to see when this should be used in practice.  As I am writing a program all of the functions that I use are made available through the header files I have included.  So why would it be useful to <code>extern</code> to get access to something that was not exposed in the header file?</p>

<p>I could be thinking about how <code>extern</code> works incorrectly, and if so please correct me.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Should you <code>extern</code> something when it is the default declaration without the keyword in a header file?</p>
","<p>""<code>extern</code>"" changes the linkage. With the keyword, the function / variable is assumed to be available somewhere else and the resolving is deferred to the linker.</p>

<p>There's a difference between ""extern"" on functions and on variables: on variables it doesn't instantiate the variable itself, i.e. doesn't allocate any memory. This needs to be done somewhere else. Thus it's important if you want to import the variable from somewhere else. For functions, this only tells the compiler that linkage is extern. As this is the default (you use the keyword ""static"" to indicate that a function is not bound using extern linkage) you don't need to use it explicitly.</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>

<p>After closing the socket on peer side (I have tried clean closing by calling close and also abnormal closing by killing the peer), if I try to send 40 bytes, then I don't get a broken pipe, but, if I try to send 40000 bytes then it immediately gives broken pipe error.</p>

","<p>It can take time for the network close to be observed - the total time is nominally about 2 minutes (yes, minutes!) after a close before the packets destined for the port are all assumed to be dead.  The error condition is detected at some point.  With a small write, you are inside the MTU of the system, so the message is queued for sending.  With a big write, you are bigger than the MTU and the system spots the problem quicker.  If you ignore the SIGPIPE signal, then the functions will return EPIPE error on a broken pipe - at some point when the broken-ness of the connection is detected.</p>

</code></pre>
","<p>In C arrays are passed as a pointer to the first element. They are the only element that is not really passed by value (the pointer is passed by value, but the array is not copied). That allows the called function to modify the contents.</p>

<p>Now, if what you want is changing the array itself (number of elements...) you cannot do it with stack or global arrays, only with dynamically allocated memory in the heap. In that case,  if you want to change the pointer you must pass a pointer to it:</p>

<pre><code>void resize( int **p, int size ) {
   free( *p );
   *p = (int*) malloc( size * sizeof(int) );

typedef struct Coordinate Coordinate;  // generate a type alias 'Coordinate' that is equivalent to struct Coordinate

       = 10101_2 * (1 * 2^2  +  0 * 2^1  +  1 * 2^0)

<p>(<code>_2</code> means base 2)</p>

<p>As you can see, multiplication can be decomposed into adding and shifting and back again. This is also why multiplication takes longer than bit shifts or adding - it's O(n^2) rather than O(n) in the number of bits. Real computer systems (as opposed to theoretical computer systems) have a finite number of bits, so multiplication takes a constant multiple of time compared to addition and shifting. If I recall correctly, modern processors, if pipelined properly, can do multiplication just about as fast as addition, by messing with the utilization of the ALUs (arithmetic units) in the processor.</p>

","<p>your function signature needs to be:</p>

<pre><code>const char * myFunction()
{
    return ""My String"";
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>It's been years since this post &amp; never thought it would be voted up, because it's so fundamental to C &amp; C++. Nevertheless, a little more discussion should be in order.</p>

<p>In C (&amp; C++ for that matter), a string is just an array of bytes terminated with a zero byte-- hence the term ""string-zero"" is used to represent this particular flavour of string. There are other kinds of strings, but in C (&amp; C++), this flavour is inherently understood by the language itself. Other languages (Java, Pascal, etc) use different methodologies to understand ""my string"".</p>

<p>If you ever use the Windows API (which is in C++), you'll see quite regularly function parameters like: ""LPCSTR lpszName"". The 'sz' part represents this notion of 'string-zero': an array of bytes with a null (/zero) terminator.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>

<p>For the sake of this 'intro', I use the word 'bytes' and 'characters' interchangeably, because it's easier to learn this way. Be aware that there are other methods (wide-characters, and multi-byte character systems--mbcs) that are used to cope with international characters. UTF-8 is an example of a mbcs. For the sake of intro, I quietly 'skip over' all of this.</p>

<p><strong>Memory:</strong></p>

<p>What this means is that a string like ""my string"" actually uses 9+1 (=10!) bytes. This is important to know when you finally get around to allocating strings dynamically.
So, without this 'terminating zero', you don't have a string. You have an array of characters (also called a buffer) hanging around in memory.</p>

<p><strong>Longevity of data:</strong></p>

<p>The use of the function this way:</p>

<pre><code>const char * myFunction()
{
    return ""My String"";
}
int main() 
{
    const char* szSomeString = myFunction(); // fraught with problems
    printf(""%s"", szSomeString);
}
</code></pre>

<p>... will generally land you with random unhandled-exceptions/segment faults and the like, especially 'down the road'. </p>

<p>In short, although my answer is correct -- 9 times out of 10 you'll end up with a program that crashes if you use it that way, especially if you think it's 'good practice' to do it that way. In short: It's generally not.</p>

<p>For example, imagine some time in the future, the string now needs to be manipulated in some way. Generally, a coder will 'take the easy path' and (try to) write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>const char * myFunction(const char* name)
{
    char szBuffer[255];
    snprintf(szBuffer, sizeof(szBuffer), ""Hi %s"", name);
    return szBuffer;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That is, your program will crash because the compiler (may/may not) have released the memory used by <code>szBuffer</code> by the time the <code>printf()</code> in <code>main()</code> is called. (Your compiler should also warn you of such problems beforehand). </p>

<p>There are two ways to return strings that won't barf so readily.</p>

<ol>
<li>returning buffers (static or dynamically allocated) that live for a while. In C++ use 'helper classes' (eg. <code>std::string</code>) to handle the longevity of data (which requires changing the function's return value), or</li>
<li>pass a buffer to the function that gets filled in with information.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that it is impossible to use strings without using pointers in C. As I have shown, they are synonymous. Even in C++ with template classes, there are always buffers (ie pointers) being used in the background. </p>

<p>So, to better answer the (now modified question). (there are sure to be a variety of 'other answers' that can be provided).</p>

<p><strong>Safer Answers:</strong></p>

<p>eg 1. using statically allocated strings:</p>

<pre><code>const char* calculateMonth(int month) 
{
    static char* months[] = {""Jan"", ""Feb"", ""Mar"" .... }; 
    static char badFood[] = ""Unknown"";
    if (month&lt;1 || month&gt;12) 
        return badFood; // choose whatever is appropriate for bad input. Crashing is never appropriate however.
    else
        return months[month-1];
}
int main()
{
    printf(""%s"", calculateMonth(2)); // prints ""Feb""
}
</code></pre>

<p>What the 'static' does here (many programmers do not like this type of 'allocation') is that the strings get put into the data segment of the program. That is, it's permanently allocated.</p>

<p>If you move over to C++ you'll use similar strategies:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo 
{
    char _someData[12];
public:
    const char* someFunction() const
    { // the final 'const' is to let the compiler know that nothing is changed in the class when this function is called.
        return _someData;
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<p>... but it's probably easier to use helper classes, such as <code>std::string</code>, if you're writing the code for your own use (and not part of a library to be shared with others).</p>

<p>eg 2. using caller-defined buffers:</p>

<p>This is the more 'fool proof' way of passing strings around. The data returned isn't subject to manipulation by the calling party. That is, eg 1 can easily be abused by a calling party and expose you to application faults. This way, it's much safer (albeit uses more lines of code):</p>

<pre><code>void calculateMonth(int month, char* pszMonth, int buffersize) 
{
    const char* months[] = {""Jan"", ""Feb"", ""Mar"" .... }; // allocated dynamically during the function call. (Can be inefficient with a bad compiler)
    if (!pszMonth || buffersize&lt;1) 
        return; // bad input. Let junk deal with junk data.
    if (month&lt;1 || month&gt;12)
    {
        *pszMonth = '\0'; // return an 'empty' string 
        // OR: strncpy(pszMonth, ""Bad Month"", buffersize-1);
    }
    else
    {
        strncpy(pszMonth, months[month-1], buffersize-1);
    }
    pszMonth[buffersize-1] = '\0'; // ensure a valid terminating zero! Many people forget this!
}

int main()
{
    char month[16]; // 16 bytes allocated here on the stack.
    calculateMonth(3, month, sizeof(month));
    printf(""%s"", month); // prints ""Mar""
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are lots of reasons why the 2nd method is better, particularly if you're writing a library to be used by others (you don't need to lock into a particular allocation/deallocation scheme, 3rd parties can't break your code, you don't need to link to a specific memory management library), but like all code, it's up to you on what you like best. For that reason, most people opt for eg 1 until they've been burnt so many times that they refuse to write it that way anymore ;)</p>

Also I feel the second method has a smaller chance of introducing a bug of the ilk:</p>

<pre><code>if (some_ptr = NULL)
</code></pre>

<p>which is just an absolute pain to find and debug.</p>

<p>Which way do you prefer and why?</p>
","<p>In my experience, tests of the form <code>if (ptr)</code> or <code>if (!ptr)</code> are preferred. They do not depend on the definition of the symbol <code>NULL</code>. They do not expose the opportunity for the accidental assignment. And they are clear and succinct. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As SoapBox points out in a comment, they are compatible with C++ classes such as <code>auto_ptr</code> that are objects that act as pointers and which provide a conversion to <code>bool</code> to enable exactly this idiom. For these objects, an explicit comparison to <code>NULL</code> would have to invoke a conversion to pointer which may have other semantic side effects or be more expensive than the simple existence check that the <code>bool</code> conversion implies.</p>

<p>I have a preference for code that says what it means without unneeded text. <code>if (ptr != NULL)</code> has the same meaning as <code>if (ptr)</code> but at the cost of redundant specificity. The next logical thing is to write <code>if ((ptr != NULL) == TRUE)</code> and that way lies madness. The C language is clear that a boolean tested by <code>if</code>, <code>while</code> or the like has a specific meaning of non-zero value is true and zero is false. Redundancy does not make it clearer.</p>

"Static linking vs dynamic linking","180023","","<p>Are there any compelling performance reasons to choose static linking over dynamic linking or vice versa in certain situations? I've heard or read the following, but I don't know enough on the subject to vouch for its veracity.</p>

<p>1) The difference in runtime performance between static linking and dynamic linking is usually negligible.</p>

<p>2) (1) is not true if using a profiling compiler that uses profile data to optimize program hotpaths because with static linking, the compiler can optimize both your code and the library code. With dynamic linking only your code can be optimized. If most of the time is spent running library code, this can make a big difference. Otherwise, (1) still applies.</p>
","<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic</strong> linking can <strong>reduce total resource consumption</strong> (if more than one process shares the same library (including the version in ""the same"", of course)). I believe this is the argument that drives it its presence in most environments. Here ""resources"" includes disk space, RAM, and cache space. Of course, if your dynamic linker is insufficiently flexible there is a risk of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell"" rel=""noreferrer"">DLL hell</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic</strong> linking means that bug fixes and upgrades to libraries <strong>propagate</strong> to improve <em>your</em> product without requiring you to ship anything.</li>
<li><strong>Plugins</strong> always call for <strong>dynamic</strong> linking.</li>
<li><strong>Static</strong> linking, means that you can know the code will run in very <strong>limited environments</strong> (early in the boot process, or in rescue mode).</li>
<li><strong>Static</strong> linking can make binaries <strong>easier to distribute</strong> to diverse user environments (at the cost of sending a large and more resource hungry program).</li>
<li><strong>Static</strong> linking may allow slightly <strong>faster startup</strong> times, but this depends to some degree on both the size and complexity of your program <em>and</em> on the details of the OSs loading strategy.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Some edits to include the very relevant suggestions in the comments and in other answers. I'd like to note that the way you break on this depends a lot on what environment you plan to run in. Minimal embedded systems may not have enough resources to support dynamic linking. Slightly larger small systems may well support linking, because their memory is small enough to make the RAM savings from dynamic linking very attractive. Full blown consumer PCs have, as Mark notes, enormous resources, and you can probably let the convenience issues drive you thinking on this matter.</p>

<hr>

<p>To address the performance and efficiency issues: <strong>it depends</strong>.</p>

<p>Classically, dynamic libraries require a some kind of glue layer which often means double dispatch or an extra layer of indirection in function addressing and can cost a little speed (but is function calling time actually a big part of your running time???).</p>

<p>However, if you are running multiple processes which all call the same library a lot, you can end up saving cache lines (and thus winning on running performance) when using dynamic linking relative using static linking. (Unless modern OS's are smart enough to notice identical segments in statically linked binaries. Seems hard, anyone know?)</p>

<p>Another issue: loading time. You pay loading costs at some point. When you pay this cost depends on how the OS works as well as what linking you use. Maybe you'd rather put off paying it until you know you need it.</p>

<p>Note that static-vs--dynamic linking is traditionally <em>not</em> a optimization issue, because they both involve separate compilation down to object files. However, this is not required: a compiler can in principle, ""compile"" ""static libraries"" to a digested AST form initially, and ""link"" them by adding those ASTs to the ones generated for the main code, thus empowering global optimization. None of the systems I use do this, so I can't comment on how well it works.</p>

The <em>real</em> problem with your code is that you don't check the <code>scanf</code> return value. <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/scanf/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>scanf</code></a> returns the number of successfully read items, so in this case it must return 1 for valid values. If not, an invalid integer value was entered and the <code>num</code> variable did probably not get changed (i.e. still has an arbitrary value because you didn't initialize it).</p>

<p>As of your comment, you only want to allow the user to enter an integer followed by the enter key. Unfortunately, this can't be simply achieved by <code>scanf(""%d\n"")</code>, but here's a trick to do it:</p>

<pre><code>int num;
char term;
if(scanf(""%d%c"", &amp;num, &amp;term) != 2 || term != '\n')
    printf(""failure\n"");
else
    printf(""valid integer followed by enter key\n"");

<p>From the website:</p>

<pre><code>char * strtok ( char * str, const char * delimiters );
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a first call, the function expects a C string as argument for str, whose first character is used as the starting location to scan for tokens. In subsequent calls, the function expects a null pointer and uses the position right after the end of last token as the new starting location for scanning.</p>
  
  <p>Once the terminating null character of str is found in a call to strtok, all subsequent calls to this function (with a null pointer as the first argument) return a null pointer.</p>
  
  <h1>Parameters</h1>
  
  <ul>
  <li>str
  
  <ul>
  <li>C string to truncate.</li>
  <li>Notice that this string is modified by being broken into smaller strings (tokens).
  Alternativelly [sic], a null pointer may be specified, in which case the function continues scanning where a previous successful call to the function ended.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>delimiters
  
  <ul>
  <li>C string containing the delimiter characters.</li>
  <li>These may vary from one call to another.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>Return Value</h1>

<p>Check the result of the input call for the appropriate condition above, then call <code>feof()</code> to determine if the result was due to hitting EOF or some other error.  </p>

<p>Using <code>fgets()</code>:</p>

 while (fgets(buffer, sizeof buffer, stream) != NULL)
 {
   // process buffer
 }
 if (feof(stream))
 {
   // hit end of file

 {
   // some other error interrupted the read

<p>Using <code>fscanf()</code>:</p>

{
  // process buffer
}
if (feof(stream)) 
{
  // hit end of file
}
else
{
  // some other error interrupted the read
}

<p>Using <code>fgetc()</code>:</p>

{
  // process c
}
if (feof(stream))
{
  // hit end of file

<pre><code>while(!feof(stream))
{
  fscanf(stream, ""%s"", buffer);
  ...
}

<p>This form doesn't work the way people think it does, because <code>feof()</code> won't return true until <em>after</em> you've attempted to read past the end of the file.  As a result, the loop executes one time too many, which may or may not cause you some grief.  </p>

","<p>This is guaranteed to have <em>nothing</em> to do with the compiler. All compilers do is compile the code that they are given. What you're looking for is a GUI library, which you can write code against using any compiler that you want.</p>

<p>Of course, that being said, your first order of business should be to ditch Turbo C. That compiler is about 20 years old and continuing to use it isn't doing you any favors. You can't write <em>modern</em> GUI applications, as it will only produce 16-bit code. All modern operating systems are 32-bit, and many are now 64-bit. It's also worth noting that 64-bit editions of Windows will not run 16-bit applications natively. You'll need an emulator for that; it's not really going to engender much feeling of accomplishment if you can only write apps that work in a DOS emulator. :-)</p>

<p>Microsoft's Visual Studio Express C++ <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP"" rel=""noreferrer"">is available as a free download</a>. It includes the same compiler available in the full version of the suite. The C++ package also compiles pure C code.</p>

<p>And since you're working in Windows, the Windows API is a natural choice. It allows you to write native Windows applications that have access to the full set of GUI controls. You'll find <a href=""http://www.winprog.org/tutorial/start.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">a nice tutorial here</a> on writing WinAPI applications in C. If you choose to go with Visual Studio, it also includes boilerplate code for a blank WinAPI application that will get you up and running quickly.</p>

<p>If you really care about learning to do this, Charles Petzold's <a href=""http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Programming Windows</a> is the canonical resource of the subject, and definitely worth a read. The entire Windows API was written in C, and it's entirely possible to write full-featured Windows applications in C. You don't need no stinkin' C++.</p>

<p>That's the way <em>I'd</em> do it, at least. As the other answers suggest, <a href=""http://www.gtk.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GTK</a> is also an option. But the applications it generates are just downright horrible-looking on Windows.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Oh dear... It looks like you're not alone in wanting to write ""GUI"" applications using an antiquated compiler.

<p>One absolutely non-intuitive syntax of the mutex is <code>pthread_mutex_lock( &amp;mutex1 );</code>, where it looks like the mutex is being locked, when what I really want to lock is some other variable. Does this syntax mean that locking a mutex locks a region of code until the mutex is unlocked? Then how do threads know that the region is locked? [<em>UPDATE: Threads know that the region is locked, by</em> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier#Multithreaded_programming_and_memory_visibility"" rel=""noreferrer"">Memory Fencing</a> ]. And isn't such a phenomenon supposed to be called critical section? [<em>UPDATE: Critical section objects are available in Windows only, where the objects are faster than mutexes and are visible only to the thread which implements it. Otherwise, critical section just refers to the area of code protected by a mutex</em>]</p>

<p>In short, could you please help with the simplest possible mutex <strong>example program</strong> and the simplest possible <strong>explanation</strong> on the logic of how it works? I'm sure this will help <strong><em>plenty</em></strong> of other newbies.</p>
","<p><em>Edits to the explanation and code are most welcome (to make it clearer/shorter/simpler/more correct).<br>
Here goes my humble attempt to explain the concept to newbies around the world: (a <a href=""http://nrecursions.blogspot.in/2014/08/mutex-tutorial-and-example.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">colour coded version</a> on my blog too)</em>  </p>

<p>A lot of people run to a lone phone booth (no mobiles) to talk to their loved ones. The first person to catch the door-handle of the booth, is the one who is allowed to use the phone. He has to keep holding on to the handle of the door as long as he uses the phone, otherwise someone else will catch hold of the handle, throw him out and talk to his wife :) There's no queue system as such. When the person finishes his call, comes out of the booth and leaves the door handle, the next person to get hold of the door handle will be allowed to use the phone.  </p>

<p>A <strong>thread</strong> is     : Each person<br>
The <strong>mutex</strong> is    : The door handle<br>
The <strong>lock</strong> is     : The person's hand<br>
The <strong>resource</strong> is : The phone  </p>

<p>Any thread which has to execute some lines of code which should not be modified by other threads at the same time (using the phone to talk to his wife), has to first acquire a lock on a mutex (clutching the door handle of the booth). Only then will a thread be able to run those lines of code (making the phone call).  </p>

<p>Once the thread has executed that code, it should release the lock on the mutex so that another thread can acquire a lock on the mutex (other people being able to access the phone booth).</p>

<p>[<em>The concept of having a mutex is a bit absurd when considering real-world exclusive access, but in the programming world I guess there was no other way to let the other threads 'see' that a thread was already executing some lines of code. There are concepts of recursive mutexes etc, but this example was only meant to show you the basic concept. Hope the example gives you a clear picture of the concept.</em>]  </p>

<hr>

<h3>Edit</h3>

<p>Reviewing some of the other answers here, because the comment fields are too short to do there. Multiple alternatives were proposed, but it wasn't shown how they behave. Here is how they do</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t (*matrix_ptr)[][20] = l_matrix;
</code></pre>

<p>If you fix the error and add the address-of operator <code>&amp;</code> like in the following snippet</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t (*matrix_ptr)[][20] = &amp;l_matrix;
</code></pre>

<p>Then that one creates a pointer to an incomplete array type of elements of type array of 20 uint8_t. Because the pointer is to an array of arrays, you have to access it with</p>

<pre><code>(*matrix_ptr)[0][1] = ...;
</code></pre>

<p>And because it's a pointer to an incomplete array, you <em>cannot</em> do as a shortcut</p>

<pre><code>matrix_ptr[0][0][1] = ...;
</code></pre>

<p>Because indexing requires the element type's size to be known (indexing implies an addition of an integer to the pointer, so it won't work with incomplete types). Note that this only works in <code>C</code>, because <code>T[]</code> and <code>T[N]</code> are compatible types. C++ does not have a concept of <em>compatible types</em>, and so it will reject that code, because <code>T[]</code> and <code>T[10]</code> are different types. </p>

<hr>

<p>The following alternative doesn't work at all, because the element type of the array, when you view it as a one-dimensional array, is <em>not</em> <code>uint8_t</code>, but <code>uint8_t[20]</code></p>

<pre><code>uint8_t *matrix_ptr = l_matrix; // fail
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The following is a good alternative</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t (*matrix_ptr)[10][20] = &amp;l_matrix;
</code></pre>

<p>You access it with </p>

<pre><code>(*matrix_ptr)[0][1] = ...;
matrix_ptr[0][0][1] = ...; // also possible now
</code></pre>

<p>It has the benefit that it preserves the outer dimension's size. So you can apply sizeof on it</p>

<pre><code>sizeof (*matrix_ptr) == sizeof(uint8_t) * 10 * 20
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>There is one other answer that makes use of the fact that items in an array are contiguously stored</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t *matrix_ptr = l_matrix[0];
</code></pre>

<p>Now, that formally only allows you to access the elements of the first element of the two dimensional array. That is, the following condition hold</p>

<pre><code>matrix_ptr[0] = ...; // valid
matrix_ptr[19] = ...; // valid

matrix_ptr[20] = ...; // undefined behavior
matrix_ptr[10*20-1] = ...; // undefined behavior
</code></pre>

<p>You will notice it probably works up to <code>10*20-1</code>, but if you throw on alias analysis and other aggressive optimizations, some compiler could make an assumption that may break that code. Having said that, i've never encountered a compiler that fails on it (but then again, i've not used that technique in real code), and even the C FAQ has that technique contained (with a warning about its UB'ness), and if you cannot change the array type, this is a last option to save you :)</p>

"Difference between static and shared libraries?","170425","","<p>What is the difference between static and shared libraries?</p>

<p>I use Eclipse and there are several project types including Static Libraries and Shared Libraries? Does one have an advantage over the other?</p>
","<p>Shared libraries are .so (or in Windows .dll, or in OS X .dylib) files. All the code relating to the library is in this file, and it is referenced by programs using it at run-time. A program using a shared library only makes reference to the code that it uses in the shared library.</p>

<p>Static libraries are .a (or in Windows .lib) files. All the code relating to the library is in this file, and it is directly linked into the program at compile time. A program using a static library takes copies of the code that it uses from the static library and makes it part of the program. [Windows also has .lib files which are used to reference .dll files, but they act the same way as the first one].</p>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages in each method.</p>

<p>Shared libraries reduce the amount of code that is duplicated in each program that makes use of the library, keeping the binaries small. It also allows you to replace the shared object with one that is functionally equivalent, but may have added performance benefits without needing to recompile the program that makes use of it. Shared libraries will, however have a small additional cost for the execution of the functions as well as a run-time loading cost as all the symbols in the library need to be connected to the things they use. Additionally, shared libraries can be loaded into an application at run-time, which is the general mechanism for implementing binary plug-in systems.</p>

<p>Static libraries increase the overall size of the binary, but it means that you don't need to carry along a copy of the library that is being used. As the code is connected at compile time there are not any additional run-time loading costs. The code is simply there.</p>

<p>Personally, I prefer shared libraries, but use static libraries when needing to ensure that the binary does not have many external dependencies that may be difficult to meet, such as specific versions of the C++ standard library or specific versions of the Boost C++ library.</p>

"How do you implement a circular buffer in C?","170230","","<p>I have a need for a fixed-size (selectable at run-time when creating it, not compile-time) circular buffer which can hold objects of any type and it needs to be <em>very</em> high performance. I don't think there will be resource contention issues since, although it's in a multi-tasking embedded environment, it's a co-operative one so the tasks themselves can manage that.</p>

<p>My initial thought were to store a simple struct in the buffer which would contain the type (simple enum/define) and a void pointer to the payload but I want this to be as fast as possible so I'm open to suggestions that involve bypassing the heap.</p>

<p>Actually I'm happy to bypass any of the standard library for raw speed - from what I've seen of the code, it's not heavily optimized for the CPU : it looks like they just compiled C code for things like <code>strcpy()</code> and such, there's no hand-coded assembly.</p>

<p>Any code or ideas would be greatly appreciated. The operations required are:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a buffer with specific size.</li>
<li>put at the tail.</li>
<li>get from the head.</li>
<li>return the count.</li>
<li>delete a buffer.</li>
</ul>
","<p>Can you enumerate the types needed at the time you code up the buffer, or do you need to be able to add types at run time via dynamic calls?  If the former, then I would create the buffer as a heap-allocated array of n structs, where each struct consists of two elements: an enum tag identifying the data type, and a union of all the data types.  What you lose in terms of extra storage for small elements, you make up in terms of not having to deal with allocation/deallocation and the resulting memory fragmentation.  Then you just need to keep track of the start and end indices that define the head and tail elements of the buffer, and make sure to compute mod n when incrementing/decrementing the indices.</p>

"C - determine if a number is prime","169781","","<p>I am trying to come up with a method that takes an integer and returns a boolean to say if the number is prime or not and I don't know much C; would anyone care to give me some pointers?</p>

<p>Basically, I would do this in C# like this:</p>

<pre><code>static bool IsPrime(int number)
{
    for (int i = 2; i &lt; number; i++)
    {
        if (number % i == 0 &amp;&amp; i != number)

    }
    return true;

","<p>OK, so forget about C.  Suppose I give you a number and ask you to determine if it's prime.  How do you do it?  Write down the steps clearly, <em>then</em> worry about translating them into code.</p>

<p>Once you have the algorithm determined, it will be much easier for you to figure out how to write a program, and for others to help you with it.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> Here's the C# code you posted:</p>

<pre><code>static bool IsPrime(int number) {
    for (int i = 2; i &lt; number; i++) {
        if (number % i == 0 &amp;&amp; i != number) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is <em>very nearly</em> valid C as is; there's no <code>bool</code> type in C, and no <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, so you need to modify it a little bit (edit: Kristopher Johnson correctly points out that C99 added the stdbool.h header).  Since some people don't have access to a C99 environment (but you should use one!), let's make that very minor change:</p>

<pre><code>int IsPrime(int number) {
    int i;
    for (i=2; i&lt;number; i++) {
        if (number % i == 0 &amp;&amp; i != number) return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a perfectly valid C program that does what you want.  We can improve it a little bit without too much effort.  First, note that <code>i</code> is always less than <code>number</code>, so the check that <code>i != number</code> always succeeds; we can get rid of it.</p>

<p>Also, you don't actually need to try divisors all the way up to <code>number - 1</code>; you can stop checking when you reach sqrt(number).  Since <code>sqrt</code> is a floating-point operation and that brings a whole pile of subtleties, we won't actually compute <code>sqrt(number)</code>.  Instead, we can just check that <code>i*i &lt;= number</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int IsPrime(int number) {
    int i;
    for (i=2; i*i&lt;=number; i++) {
        if (number % i == 0) return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>One last thing, though; there was a small bug in your original algorithm!  If <code>number</code> is negative, or zero, or one, this function will claim that the number is prime.  You likely want to handle that properly, and you may want to make <code>number</code> be unsigned, since you're more likely to care about positive values only:</p>

<pre><code>int IsPrime(unsigned int number) {
    if (number &lt;= 1) return 0; // zero and one are not prime
    unsigned int i;
    for (i=2; i*i&lt;=number; i++) {
        if (number % i == 0) return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This definitely isn't the fastest way to check if a number is prime, but it works, and it's pretty straightforward.  We barely had to modify your code at all!</p>

I am curious as to the reason for this and the benefits it brings.</p>
","<p>The <code>size_t</code> type is the unsigned integer type that is the result of the <code>sizeof</code> operator (and the <code>offsetof</code> operator), so it is guaranteed to be big enough to contain the size of the biggest object your system can handle (e.g., a static array of 8Gb).</p>

"Return a `struct` from a function in C","169105","","<p>Today I was teaching a couple of friends how to use C <code>struct</code>s. One of them asked if you could return a <code>struct</code> from a function, to which I replied: ""No! You'd return pointers to dynamically <code>malloc</code>ed <code>struct</code>s instead.""</p>

<p>Coming from someone who primarily does C++, I was expecting not be able to return <code>struct</code>s by values. In C++ you can overload the <code>operator =</code> for your objects and makes complete sense to have a function to return your object by value. In C, however, you do not have that option and so it got me thinking what the compiler is actually doing. Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyObj{
    double x, y;
};

struct MyObj foo(){
    struct MyObj a;

    a.x = 10;
    a.y = 10;

    return a;
}        

int main () {

    struct MyObj a;

    a = foo();    // This DOES work
    struct b = a; // This does not work

    return 0;
}    
</code></pre>

<p>I understand why <code>struct b = a;</code> should not work -- you cannot overload <code>operator =</code> for your data type. How is it that <code>a = foo();</code> compiles fine? Does it mean something other than <code>struct b = a;</code>? Maybe the question to ask is: What exactly does the <code>return</code> statement in conjunction to <code>=</code> sign do?</p>

<p>[edit]: Ok, I was just pointed <code>struct b = a</code> is a syntax error -- that's correct and I'm an idiot! But that makes it even more complicated! Using <code>struct MyObj b = a</code> does indeed work! What am I missing here?</p>
","<p>You can return a structure from a function (or use the <code>=</code> operator) without any problems.  It's a well-defined part of the language.  The only problem with <code>struct b = a</code> is that you didn't provide a complete type.  <code>struct MyObj b = a</code> will work just fine.  You can pass structures <em>to</em> functions as well - a structure is exactly the same as any built-in type for purposes of parameter passing, return values, and assignment.</p>

<p>Here's a simple demonstration program that does all three - passes a structure as a parameter, returns a structure from a function, and uses structures in assignment statements:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

struct a {
   int i;
};

struct a f(struct a x)
{
   struct a r = x;
   return r;
}

int main(void)
{
   struct a x = { 12 };
   struct a y = f(x);
   printf(""%d\n"", y.i);
   return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The next example is pretty much exactly the same, but uses the built-in <code>int</code> type for demonstration purposes.  The two programs have the same behaviour with respect to pass-by-value for parameter passing, assignment, etc.:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int f(int x) 
{
  int r = x;
  return r;
}

<p>What is wrong with this <code>while( !feof(fp))</code> loop?</p>
","<p>I'd like to provide an abstract, high-level perspective.</p>

<h3>Concurrency and simultaneity</h3>

<p>I/O operations interact with the environment. The environment is not part of your program, and not under your control. The environment truly exists ""concurrently"" with your program. As with all things concurrent, questions about the ""current state"" don't make sense: There is no concept of ""simultaneity"" across concurrent events. Many properties of state simply don't <em>exist</em> concurrently.</p>

<p>Let me make this more precise: Suppose you want to ask, ""do you have more data"". You could ask this of a concurrent container, or of your I/O system. But the answer is generally unactionable, and thus meaningless. So what if the container says ""yes"" &ndash; by the time you try reading, it may no longer have data. Similarly, if the answer is ""no"", by the time you try reading, data may have arrived. The conclusion is that there simply <em>is</em> no property like ""I have data"", since you cannot act meaningfully in response to any possible answer. (The situation is slightly better with buffered input, where you might conceivably get a ""yes, I have data"" that constitutes some kind of guarantee, but you would still have to be able to deal with the opposite case. And with output the situation is certainly just as bad as I described: you never know if that disk or that network buffer is full.)</p>

<p>So we conclude that it is impossible, and in fact un<em>reasonable</em>, to ask an I/O system whether it <em>will be</em> able to perform an I/O operation. The only possible way we can interact with it (just as with a concurrent container) is to <em>attempt</em> the operation and check whether it succeeded or failed. At that moment where you interact with the environment, then and only then can you know whether the interaction was actually possible, and at that point you must commit to performing the interaction. (This is a ""synchronisation point"", if you will.)</p>

<h3>EOF</h3>

<p>Now we get to EOF. EOF is the <em>response</em> you get from an <em>attempted</em> I/O operation. It means that you were trying to read or write something, but when doing so you failed to read or write any data, and instead the end of the input or output was encountered. This is true for essentially all the I/O APIs, whether it be the C standard library, C++ iostreams, or other libraries. As long as the I/O operations succeed, you simply <em>cannot know</em> whether further, future operations will succeed. You <em>must</em> always first try the operation and then respond to success or failure.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>In each of the examples, note carefully that we <em>first</em> attempt the I/O operation and <em>then</em> consume the result if it is valid. Note further that we <em>always</em> must use the result of the I/O operation, though the result takes different shapes and forms in each example.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>C stdio, read from a file:</p>

<pre><code>for (;;) {
    size_t n = fread(buf, 1, bufsize, infile);
    consume(buf, n);
    if (n &lt; bufsize) { break; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The result we must use is <code>n</code>, the number of elements that were read (which may be as little as zero).</p></li>
<li><p>C stdio, <code>scanf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for (int a, b, c; scanf(""%d %d %d"", &amp;a, &amp;b, &amp;c) == 3; ) {
    consume(a, b, c);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The result we must use is the return value of <code>scanf</code>, the number of elements converted.</p></li>
<li><p>C++, iostreams formatted extraction:</p>

<pre><code>for (int n; std::cin &gt;&gt; n; ) {
    consume(n);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The result we must use is <code>std::cin</code> itself, which can be evaluated in a boolean context and tells us whether the stream is still in the <code>good()</code> state.</p></li>
<li><p>C++, iostreams getline:</p>

<pre><code>for (std::string line; std::getline(std::cin, line); ) {
    consume(line);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The result we must use is again <code>std::cin</code>, just as before.</p></li>
<li><p>POSIX, <code>write(2)</code> to flush a buffer:</p>

<pre><code>char const * p = buf;
ssize_t n = bufsize;
for (ssize_t k = bufsize; (k = write(fd, p, n)) &gt; 0; p += k, n -= k) {}
if (n != 0) { /* error, failed to write complete buffer */ }
</code></pre>

<p>The result we use here is <code>k</code>, the number of bytes written. The point here is that we can only know how many bytes were written <em>after</em> the write operation.</p></li>
<li><p>POSIX <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getline.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>getline()</code></a></p>

<pre><code>char *buffer = NULL;
size_t bufsiz = 0;
ssize_t nbytes;
while ((nbytes = getline(&amp;buffer, &amp;bufsiz, fp)) != -1)
{
    /* Use nbytes of data in buffer */
}
free(buffer);
</code></pre>

<p>The result we must use is <code>nbytes</code>, the number of bytes up to and including the newline (or EOF if the file did not end with a newline).</p>

<p>Note that the function explicitly returns <code>-1</code> (and not EOF!) when an error occurs or it reaches EOF.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You may notice that we very rarely spell out the actual word ""EOF"". We usually detect the error condition in some other way that is more immediately interesting to us (e.g. failure to perform as much I/O as we had desired). In every example there is some API feature that could tell us explicitly that the EOF state has been encountered, but this is in fact not a terribly useful piece of information. It is much more of a detail than we often care about. What matters is whether the I/O succeeded, more-so than how it failed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A final example that actually queries the EOF state: Suppose you have a string and want to test that it represents an integer in its entirety, with no extra bits at the end except whitespace. Using C++ iostreams, it goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>std::string input = ""   123   "";   // example

std::istringstream iss(input);
int value;
if (iss &gt;&gt; value &gt;&gt; std::ws &amp;&amp; iss.get() == EOF) {
    consume(value);
} else {
    // error, ""input"" is not parsable as an integer
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use two results here. The first is <code>iss</code>, the stream object itself, to check that the formatted extraction to <code>value</code> succeeded. But then, after also consuming whitespace, we perform another I/O/ operation, <code>iss.get()</code>, and expect it to fail as EOF, which is the case if the entire string has already been consumed by the formatted extraction.</p>

<p>In the C standard library you can achieve something similar with the <code>strto*l</code> functions by checking that the end pointer has reached the end of the input string.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>The answer</h3>

<p><code>while(!eof)</code> is wrong because it tests for something that is irrelevant and fails to test for something that you need to know. The result is that you are erroneously executing code that assumes that it is accessing data that was read successfully, when in fact this never happened.</p>

","<p><strong>Short story:</strong> The <code>0</code> tells the parser it's dealing with a constant (and not an identifier/reserved word). Something is still needed to specify the number base: the <code>x</code> is an arbitrary choice.</p>

<p><strong>Long story:</strong> In the 60's, the prevalent programming number systems were decimal and <em>octal</em> — mainframes had 12, 24 or 36 bits per byte, which is nicely divisible by 3 = log2(8).</p>

<p>The BCPL language used the syntax <code>8 1234</code> for octal numbers. When Ken Thompson created B from BCPL, he used the <code>0</code> prefix instead. This is great because</p>

<ol>
<li>an integer constant now always consists of a single token,</li>
<li>the parser can still tell right away it's got a constant,</li>
<li>the parser can immediately tell the base (<code>0</code> is the same in both bases),</li>
<li>it's mathematically sane (<code>00005 == 05</code>), and</li>
<li>no precious special characters are needed (as in <code>#123</code>).</li>

<p>When C was created from B, the need for hexadecimal numbers arose (the PDP-11 had 16-bit words) and all of the points above were still valid. Since octals were still needed for other machines, <code>0x</code> was arbitrarily chosen (<code>00</code> was probably ruled out as awkward).</p>

<p>Most of the time it is inappropriate to use tabs and backspace for formatting your program output.  Learn to use <code>printf()</code> formatting specifiers.  Rendering of tabs can vary drastically depending on how the output is viewed.</p>

<p>This little script shows one way to alter your terminal's tab rendering.  Tested on Ubuntu + gnome-terminal:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
tabs -8 
echo -e ""\tnormal tabstop""
for x in `seq 2 10`; do
  tabs $x
  echo -e ""\ttabstop=$x""
 done

tabs -8
echo -e ""\tnormal tabstop""
</code></pre>

<p>Also see  <code>man setterm</code> and <code>regtabs</code>.</p>

<p>And if you redirect your output or just write to a file, tabs will quite commonly be displayed as fewer than the standard 8 chars, especially in ""programming"" editors and IDEs.</p>

<p>So in otherwords:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""%-8s%s"", ""foo"", ""bar""); /* this will ALWAYS output ""foo     bar"" */
printf(""foo\tbar""); /* who knows how this will be rendered */
</code></pre>

<p>IMHO, tabs in general are rarely appropriate for anything.  An exception might be generating output for a program that requires tab-separated-value input files (similar to comma separated value).</p>

<p>Backspace <code>'\b'</code> is a different story... it should never be used to create a text file since it will just make a text editor spit out garbage.  But it does have many applications in writing interactive command line programs that cannot be accomplished with format strings alone.  If you find yourself needing it a lot, check out ""ncurses"", which gives you much better control over where your output goes on the terminal screen.  And typically, since it's 2011 and not 1995, a GUI is usually easier to deal with for highly interactive programs.  But again, there are exceptions. Like writing a telnet server or console for a new scripting language.</p>

"dereferencing pointer to incomplete type","158561","","<p>I've seen a lot of questions on this but I'm going to ask the question differently without specific code.  Is there a way of <strong><em>EASILY</em></strong> determining what is causing the type to be incomplete?  In my case I'm using someone elses code and I'm completely sure I don't have the headers right, but (since computers do this stuff much faster and better than human eyeballs) is there a way to get the compiler to say, ""hey you <em>think</em> you have type X at line 34 but that's actually <em>missing</em>.""  The error itself only shows up when you assign, which isn't very helpful.</p>
","<p>I saw a question the other day where someone inadvertently used an incomplete type by specifying something like <code>struct a { int q; }; struct A *x; x-&gt;q = 3;</code>. The compiler knew that <code>struct A</code> was a struct, despite <code>A</code> being totally undefined, by virtue of the <code>struct</code> keyword.</p>

<p>That was in C++, where such usage of <code>struct</code> is atypical (and, it turns out, can lead to foot-shooting). In C if you do</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct a {
    ...
} a;
</code></pre>

<p>then you can use <code>a</code> as the typename and omit the <code>struct</code> later. This will lead the compiler to give you an undefined identifier error later, rather than incomplete type, if you mistype the name or forget a header.</p>

What's the best practice to prevent the crash here? Is there a way to check if the other side of the line is still reading? (select() doesn't seem to work here as it always says the socket is writable). Or should I just catch the SIGPIPE with a handler and ignore it?</p>
","<p>You generally want to ignore the <code>SIGPIPE</code> and handle the error directly in your code.  This is because signal handlers in C have many restrictions on what they can do.</p>

<p>The most portable way to do this is to set the <code>SIGPIPE</code> handler to <code>SIG_IGN</code>.  This will prevent any socket or pipe write from causing a <code>SIGPIPE</code> signal.</p>

<p>To ignore the <code>SIGPIPE</code> signal, use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN);
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the <code>send()</code> call, another option is to use the <code>MSG_NOSIGNAL</code> option, which will turn the <code>SIGPIPE</code> behavior off on a per call basis.  Note that not all operating systems support the <code>MSG_NOSIGNAL</code> flag.</p>

<p>Lastly, you may also want to consider the <code>SO_SIGNOPIPE</code> socket flag that can be set with <code>setsockopt()</code> on some operating systems.  This will prevent <code>SIGPIPE</code> from being caused by writes just to the sockets it is set on.</p>

<li><p><code>struct{int: -!!(0);} --&gt; struct{int: 0;}</code>: If it was zero, then we declare a struct with an anonymous integer bitfield that has width zero. Everything is fine and we proceed as normal.</p></li>
<li><p><code>struct{int: -!!(1);} --&gt; struct{int: -1;}</code>: On the other hand, if it <em>isn't</em> zero, then it will be some negative number. Declaring any bitfield with <em>negative</em> width is a compilation error.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So we'll either wind up with a bitfield that has width 0 in a struct, which is fine, or a bitfield with negative width, which is a compilation error. Then we take <code>sizeof</code> that field, so we get a <code>size_t</code> with the appropriate width (which will be zero in the case where <code>e</code> is zero).</p>

<p>There is some reasoning as to why this would take place. How could we make things so that a C array also knows its length?</p>

<p>A first idea would be not having arrays decaying into pointers when they are passed to a function and continuing to keep the array length in the type system. The bad thing about this is that you would need to have a separate function for every possible array length and doing so is not a good idea. (Pascal did this and some people think this is one of the reasons it ""lost"" to C)</p>

<p>A second idea is storing the array length next to the array, just like any modern programming language does:</p>

"Do I cast the result of malloc?","154541","","<p>In <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/571945/getting-a-stack-overflow-exception-when-declaring-a-large-array"">this question</a>, someone suggested in a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/571945/getting-a-stack-overflow-exception-when-declaring-a-large-array#comment388297_571961"">comment</a> that I should <strong><em>not</em></strong> cast the result of <code>malloc</code>, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>int *sieve = malloc(sizeof(int) * length);
</code></pre>

<p>rather than:</p>

<pre><code>int *sieve = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int) * length);
</code></pre>

<p>Why would this be the case?</p>
","<p><strong>No</strong>; you <em>don't</em> cast the result, since:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is unnecessary, as <code>void *</code> is automatically and safely promoted to any other pointer type in this case.</li>
<li>It adds clutter to the code, casts are not very easy to read (especially if the pointer type is long).</li>
<li>It makes you repeat yourself, which is generally bad.</li>
<li>It can hide an error if you forgot to include <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>. This can cause crashes (or, worse, <em>not</em> cause a crash until way later in some totally different part of the code). Consider what happens if pointers and integers are differently sized; then you're hiding a warning by casting and might lose bits of your returned address. Note: as of C11 implicit functions are gone from C, and this point is no longer relevant since there's no automatic assumption that undeclared functions return <code>int</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a clarification, note that I said ""you don't cast"", not ""you don't <em>need</em> to cast"". In my opinion, it's a failure to include the cast, even if you got it right. There are simply no benefits to doing it, but a bunch of potential risks, and including the cast indicates that you don't know about the risks.</p>

<p>Also note, as commentators point out, that the above talks about straight C, not C++. I very firmly believe in C and C++ as separate languages.</p>

<p>To add further, your code needlessly repeats the type information (<code>int</code>) which can cause errors. It's better to dereference the pointer being used to store the return value, to ""lock"" the two together:</p>

<pre><code>int *sieve = malloc(length * sizeof *sieve);
</code></pre>

<p>This also moves the <code>length</code> to the front for increased visibility, and drops the redundant parentheses with <code>sizeof</code>; they <em>are only needed</em> when the argument is a type name. Many people seem to not know (or ignore) this, which makes their code more verbose. Remember: <code>sizeof</code> is not a function! :) </p>

<hr>

<p>While moving <code>length</code> to the front <em>may</em> increase visibility in some rare cases, one should also pay attention that in the general case, it should be better to write the expression as:</p>

<pre><code>int *sieve = malloc(sizeof *sieve * length);
</code></pre>

<p>Since keeping the <code>sizeof</code> first, in this case, ensures multiplication is done with at least <code>size_t</code> math.</p>

<p>Compare: <code>malloc(sizeof *sieve * length * width)</code> vs. <code>malloc(length * width * sizeof *sieve)</code> the second may overflow the <code>length * width</code> when <code>width</code> and <code>length</code> are smaller types than <code>size_t</code>.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Can someone explain these warnings?</p>
","<p>C strings are not anything like Java strings. They're essentially arrays of characters.</p>

<p>You are getting the error because strToLower returns a char. A char is a form of integer in C. You are assigning it into a char[] which is a pointer. Hence ""converting integer to pointer"".</p>

<p>Your strToLower makes all its changes in place, there is no reason for it to return anything, especially not a char. You should ""return"" void, or a char*.</p>

<p>On the call to strToLower, there is also no need for assignment, you are essentially just passing the memory address for cString1. </p>

<p>In my experience, Strings in C are the hardest part to learn for anyone coming from Java/C# background back to C. People can get along with memory allocation (since even in Java you often allocate arrays). If your eventual goal is C++ and not C, you may prefer to focus less on C strings, make sure you understand the basics, and just use the C++ string from STL.</p>

static int foo = 1;            static int foo = 10;

<p>Keep in mind this is a simplified version of a larger, multi-file project I'm working on.

<pre><code>#define foo_init { 1, 2, 3 }

<p>I'm also trying to write portable code, so I need a solution that's valid C89 or C99.</p>

<p>Does this have to do with the ORGs in an object file?  That initialized variables go into one ORG and are initialized by copying the contents of a second ORG?</p>

<p>Maybe I'll just need to change my tactic, and have an initializing function do all of the copies at startup.  Unless there are other ideas out there?</p>
","<p>In C language objects with static storage duration have to be initialized with <em>constant expressions</em> or with aggregate initializers containing constant expressions.</p>

<p>A ""large"" object is never a constant expression in C, even if the object is declared as <code>const</code>. </p>

<p>Moreover, in C language the term ""constant"" refers to <em>literal constants</em> (like <code>1</code>, <code>'a'</code>, <code>0xFF</code> and so on) and enum members. Const-qualified objects (of any type) are <em>not constants</em> in C language terminology. They cannot be used in initializers of objects with static storage duration, regardless of their type.</p>

<p>For example, this is <em>NOT</em> a constant</p>

<pre><code>const int N = 5; /* `N` is not a constant in C */
</code></pre>

<p>The above <code>N</code> would be a constant in C++, but it is not a constant in C. So, if you try doing </p>

</code></pre>

<p>you will get the same error: an attempt to initialize a static object with a non-constant.</p>

","<p>A typical situation you encounter strict aliasing problems is when overlaying a struct (like a device/network msg) onto a buffer of the word size of your system (like a pointer to <code>uint32_t</code>s or <code>uint16_t</code>s). When you overlay a struct onto such a buffer, or a buffer onto such a struct through pointer casting you can easily violate strict aliasing rules.</p>

<p>So in this kind of setup, if I want to send a message to something I'd have to have two incompatible pointers pointing to the same chunk of memory. I might then naively code something like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct Msg
{
    unsigned int a;
    unsigned int b;
};

void SendWord(uint32_t);

int main()
{
    // Get a 32-bit buffer from the system
    uint32_t* buff = malloc(sizeof(Msg));

    // Alias that buffer through message
    Msg* msg = (Msg*)(buff);

    // Send a bunch of messages    
    for (int i =0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
    {
        msg-&gt;a = i;
        msg-&gt;b = i+1;
        SendWord(buff[0]);
        SendWord(buff[1]);   
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The strict aliasing rule makes this setup illegal: dereferencing a pointer that aliases another of an <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/type"" rel=""noreferrer"">incompatible type</a> is undefined behavior. Unfortunately, you can still code this way, <em>maybe</em> get some warnings, have it compile fine, only to have weird unexpected behavior when you run the code. </p>

<p>(GCC appears somewhat inconsistent in its ability to give aliasing warnings, sometimes giving us a friendly warning and sometimes not.)</p>

<p>To see why this behavior is undefined, we have to think about what the strict aliasing rule buys the compiler. Basically, with this rule, it doesn't have to think about inserting instructions to refresh the contents of <code>buff</code> every run of the loop. Instead, when optimizing, with some annoyingly unenforced assumptions about aliasing, it can omit those instructions, load <code>buff[0]</code> and <code>buff[1</code>] into CPU registers once before the loop is run, and speed up the body of the loop. Before strict aliasing was introduced, the compiler had to live in a state of paranoia that the contents of <code>buff</code> could change at anytime from anywhere by anybody. So to get an extra performance edge, and assuming most people don't type-pun pointers, the strict aliasing rule was introduced.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, if you think the example is contrived, this might even happen if you're passing a buffer to another function doing the sending for you, if instead you have.</p>

<pre><code>void SendMessage(uint32_t* buff, size_t size32)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; size32; ++i) 
    {
        SendWord(buff[i]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And rewrote our earlier loop to take advantage of this convenient function</p>

<pre><code>for (int i =0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
{
    msg-&gt;a = i;
    msg-&gt;b = i+1;
    SendMessage(buff, 2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler may or may not be able to or smart enough to try to inline SendMessage and it may or may not decide to load or not load buff again. If <code>SendMessage</code> is part of another API that's compiled separately, it probably has instructions to load buff's contents. Then again, maybe you're in C++ and this is some templated header only implementation that the compiler thinks it can inline. Or maybe it's just something you wrote in your .c file for your own convenience. Anyway undefined behavior might still ensue. Even when we know some of what's happening under the hood, it's still a violation of the rule so no well defined behavior is guaranteed. So just by wrapping in a function that takes our word delimited buffer doesn't necessarily help.</p>

<p><strong>So how do I get around this?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use a union. Most compilers support this without complaining about strict aliasing. This is allowed in C99 and explicitly allowed in C11.</p>

<pre>
union {
    Msg msg;
    unsigned int asBuffer[sizeof(Msg)/sizeof(unsigned int)];
};
</pre></li>
<li><p>You can disable strict aliasing in your compiler (<a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.1/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#index-fstrict_002daliasing-825"" rel=""noreferrer"">f[no-]strict-aliasing</a> in gcc)) </p></li>
<li><p>You can use <code>char*</code> for aliasing instead of your system's word. The rules allow an exception for <code>char*</code> (including <code>signed char</code> and <code>unsigned char</code>). It's always assumed that <code>char*</code> aliases other types. However this won't work the other way: there's no assumption that your struct aliases a buffer of chars.</p></li>
</ul>

    free(mem);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Explanation as requested</h3>

<p>The first step is to allocate enough spare space, just in case.  Since the memory must be 16-byte aligned (meaning that the leading byte address needs to be a multiple of 16), adding 16 extra bytes guarantees that we have enough space.  Somewhere in the first 16 bytes, there is a 16-byte aligned pointer.  (Note that <code>malloc()</code> is supposed to return a pointer that is sufficiently well aligned for <em>any</em> purpose.  However, the meaning of 'any' is primarily for things like basic types — <code>long</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>long double</code>, <code>long long</code>, and pointers to objects and pointers to functions.  When you are doing more specialized things, like playing with graphics systems, they can need more stringent alignment than the rest of the system — hence questions and answers like this.)</p>

<p>The next step is to convert the void pointer to a char pointer; GCC notwithstanding, you are not supposed to do pointer arithmetic on void pointers (and GCC has warning options to tell you when you abuse it).  Then add 16 to the start pointer.  Suppose <code>malloc()</code> returned you an impossibly badly aligned pointer: 0x800001.  Adding the 16 gives 0x800011. Now I want to round down to the 16-byte boundary — so I want to reset the last 4 bits to 0.  0x0F has the last 4 bits set to one; therefore, <code>~0x0F</code> has all bits set to one except the last four.  Anding that with 0x800011 gives 0x800010.  You can iterate over the other offsets and see that the same arithmetic works.</p>

<p>The last step, <code>free()</code>, is easy: you always, and only, return to <code>free()</code> a value that one of <code>malloc()</code>, <code>calloc()</code> or <code>realloc()</code> returned to you — anything else is a disaster.  You correctly provided <code>mem</code> to hold that value — thank you.  The free releases it.</p>

<p>Finally, if you know about the internals of your system's <code>malloc</code> package, you could guess that it might well return 16-byte aligned data (or it might be 8-byte aligned).  If it was 16-byte aligned, then you'd not need to dink with the values.  However, this is dodgy and non-portable — other <code>malloc</code> packages have different minimum alignments, and therefore assuming one thing when it does something different would lead to core dumps.  Within broad limits, this solution is portable.</p>

<p>Someone else mentioned <code>posix_memalign()</code> as another way to get the aligned memory; that isn't available everywhere, but could often be implemented using this as a basis.  Note that it was convenient that the alignment was a power of 2; other alignments are messier.</p>

<p>One more comment — this code does not check that the allocation succeeded.</p>

<h3>Amendment</h3>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/23705/windows-programmer"">Windows Programmer</a> pointed out that you can't do bit mask operations on pointers, and, indeed, GCC (3.4.6 and 4.3.1 tested) does complain like that.  So, an amended version of the basic code — converted into a main program, follows.  I've also taken the liberty of adding just 15 instead of 16, as has been pointed out.  I'm using <code>uintptr_t</code> since C99 has been around long enough to be accessible on most platforms.  If it wasn't for the use of <code>PRIXPTR</code> in the <code>printf()</code> statements, it would be sufficient to <code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> instead of using <code>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code>. <em>[This code includes the fix pointed out by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/832878/c-r"">C.R.</a>, which was reiterating a point first made by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/12943/bill-k"">Bill K</a> a number of years ago, which I managed to overlook until now.]</em></p>

<p>And here is a marginally more generalized version, which will work for sizes which are a power of 2:</p>

    memset(space, byte, nbytes);  // Not a custom implementation of memset()
}

static void test_mask(size_t align)
{
    uintptr_t mask = ~(uintptr_t)(align - 1);
    void *mem = malloc(1024+align-1);
    void *ptr = (void *)(((uintptr_t)mem+align-1) &amp; mask);
    assert((align &amp; (align - 1)) == 0);
    printf(""0x%08"" PRIXPTR "", 0x%08"" PRIXPTR ""\n"", (uintptr_t)mem, (uintptr_t)ptr);
    memset_16aligned(ptr, 0, 1024);
    free(mem);
}

int main(void)
{
    test_mask(16);
    test_mask(32);
    test_mask(64);
    test_mask(128);
    return(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>To convert <code>test_mask()</code> into a general purpose allocation function, the single return value from the allocator would have to encode the release address, as several people have indicated in their answers.</p>

<h3>Problems with interviewers</h3>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/23072/uri"">Uri</a> commented: Maybe I am having [a] reading comprehension problem this morning, but if the interview question specifically says: ""How would you allocate 1024 bytes of memory"" and you clearly allocate more than that. Wouldn't that be an automatic failure from the interviewer?</p>

<p>My response won't fit into a 300-character comment...</p>

<p>It depends, I suppose.  I think most people (including me) took the question to mean ""How would you allocate a space in which 1024 bytes of data can be stored, and where the base address is a multiple of 16 bytes"".  If the interviewer really meant how can you allocate 1024 bytes (only) and have it 16-byte aligned, then the options are more limited.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clearly, one possibility is to allocate 1024 bytes and then give that address the 'alignment treatment'; the problem with that approach is that the actual available space is not properly determinate (the usable space is between 1008 and 1024 bytes, but there wasn't a mechanism available to specify which size), which renders it less than useful.</li>
<li>Another possibility is that you are expected to write a full memory allocator and ensure that the 1024-byte block you return is appropriately aligned.  If that is the case, you probably end up doing an operation fairly similar to what the proposed solution did, but you hide it inside the allocator.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if the interviewer expected either of those responses, I'd expect them to recognize that this solution answers a closely related question, and then to reframe their question to point the conversation in the correct direction.  (Further, if the interviewer got really stroppy, then I wouldn't want the job; if the answer to an insufficiently precise requirement is shot down in flames without correction, then the interviewer is not someone for whom it is safe to work.)</p>

<h3>The world moves on</h3>

<p>The title of the question has changed recently.  It was <em>Solve the memory alignment in C interview question that stumped me</em>.  The revised title (<em>How to allocate aligned memory only using the standard library?</em>) demands a slightly revised answer — this addendum provides it.</p>

<p>C11 (ISO/IEC 9899:2011) added function <code>aligned_alloc()</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>7.22.3.1 The <code>aligned_alloc</code> function</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Returns</strong><br>
  The <code>aligned_alloc</code> function returns either a null pointer or a pointer to the allocated space.</p>

<p>And POSIX defines <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/posix_memalign.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>posix_memalign()</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int posix_memalign(void **memptr, size_t alignment, size_t size);
</code></pre>
  
  <p>DESCRIPTION</p>
  
  <p>The <code>posix_memalign()</code> function shall allocate <code>size</code> bytes aligned on a boundary specified by <code>alignment</code>, and shall return a pointer to the allocated memory in <code>memptr</code>. The value of <code>alignment</code> shall be a power of two multiple of <code>sizeof(void *)</code>.</p>
  
  <p>Upon successful completion, the value pointed to by <code>memptr</code> shall be a multiple of <code>alignment</code>.</p>
  
  <p>If the size of the space requested is 0, the behavior is implementation-defined; the value returned in <code>memptr</code> shall be either a null pointer or a unique pointer.</p>
  
  <p>The <code>free()</code> function shall deallocate memory that has previously been allocated by <code>posix_memalign()</code>.</p>
  
  <p>RETURN VALUE</p>
  
  <p>Upon successful completion, <code>posix_memalign()</code> shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Either or both of these could be used to answer the question now, but only the POSIX function was an option when the question was originally answered.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, the new aligned memory function do much the same job as outlined in the question, except they have the ability to force the alignment more easily, and keep track of the start of the aligned memory internally so that the code doesn't have to deal with specially — it just frees the memory returned by the allocation function that was used.</p>

<p>In the latter case I don't understand why did the standard designers chose to litter the grammar with superfluous keywords.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To clarify, I know there's usage for <code>extern</code> in variables, but I'm only asking about <code>extern</code> in <strong>functions</strong>.</p>
","<p>We have two files, foo.c and bar.c.</p>

<p>Here is foo.c</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

volatile unsigned int stop_now = 0;
extern void bar_function(void);

int main(void)
{
  while (1) {
     bar_function();
     stop_now = 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, here is bar.c</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

extern volatile unsigned int stop_now;

void bar_function(void)
{
   while (! stop_now) {
      printf(""Hello, world!\n"");
      sleep(30);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we have no shared header between foo.c and bar.c , however bar.c needs something declared in foo.c when it's linked, and foo.c needs a function from bar.c when it's linked.</p>

<p>By using 'extern', you are telling the compiler that whatever follows it will be found (non-static) at link time, don't reserve anything for it since it will be encountered later.</p>

<p>It's very useful if you need to share some global between modules and don't want to put / initialize it in a header. </p>

<p>Technically, every function in a library public header is 'extern', however labeling them as such has very little to no benefit, depending on the compiler. Most compilers can figure that out on their own. As you see, those functions are actually defined somewhere else.</p>

<p>In the above example, main() would print hello world only once, but continue to enter bar_function(). Also note, bar_function() is not going to return in this example (since it's just a simple example). Just imagine stop_now being modified when a signal is serviced (hence, volatile) if this doesn't seem practical enough.</p>

<p>Externs are very useful for things like signal handlers, a mutex that you don't want to put in a header or structure, etc. Most compilers will optimize to ensure that they don't reserve any memory for external objects, since they know they'll be reserving it in the module where the object is defined. However, again, there's little point in specifying it with modern compilers when prototyping public functions.</p>

"Combining C++ and C - how does #ifdef __cplusplus work?","140909","","<p>I'm working on a project that has a lot of legacy <strong>C</strong> code.

","<p><code>extern ""C""</code> doesn't really change the way that the compiler reads the code.  If your code is in a .c file, it will be compiled as C, if it is in a .cpp file, it will be compiled as C++ (unless you do something strange to your configuration).</p>

<p>What <code>extern ""C""</code> does is affect linkage.  C++ functions, when compiled, have their names mangled -- this is what makes overloading possible.  The function name gets modified based on the types and number of parameters, so that two functions with the same name will have different symbol names.</p>

<p>Code inside an <code>extern ""C""</code> is still C++ code.  There are limitations on what you can do in an extern ""C"" block, but they're all about linkage.  You can't define any new symbols that can't be built with C linkage.  That means no classes or templates, for example.</p>

<p><code>extern ""C""</code> blocks nest nicely.  There's also <code>extern ""C++""</code> if you find yourself hopelessly trapped inside of <code>extern ""C""</code> regions, but it isn't such a good idea from a cleanliness perspective.</p>

<p>Now, specifically regarding your numbered questions:</p>

<p>Regarding #1: __cplusplus should be defined inside of <code>extern ""C""</code> blocks.  This doesn't matter, though, since the blocks should nest neatly.</p>

<p>Regarding #2: __cplusplus will be defined for any compilation unit that is being run through the C++ compiler.  Generally, that means .cpp files and any files being included by that .cpp file.  The same .h (or .hh or .hpp or what-have-you) could be interpreted as C or C++ at different times, if different compilation units include them.  If you want the prototypes in the .h file to refer to C symbol names, then they must have <code>extern ""C""</code> when being interpreted as C++, and they should not have <code>extern ""C""</code> when being interpreted as C -- hence the <code>#ifdef __cplusplus</code> checking.</p>

<p>To answer your question #3:  functions without prototypes will have C++ linkage if they are in .cpp files and not inside of an <code>extern ""C""</code> block.  This is fine, though, because if it has no prototype, it can only be called by other functions in the same file, and then you don't generally care what the linkage looks like, because you aren't planning on having that function be called by anything outside the same compilation unit anyway.</p>

<p>For #4, you've got it exactly.  If you are including a header for code that has C linkage (such as code that was compiled by a C compiler), then you must <code>extern ""C""</code> the header -- that way you will be able to link with the library.  (Otherwise, your linker would be looking for functions with names like <code>_Z1hic</code> when you were looking for <code>void h(int, char)</code></p>

<p>5:  This sort of mixing is a common reason to use <code>extern ""C""</code>, and I don't see anything wrong with doing it this way -- just make sure you understand what you are doing.</p>

","<p><strong>Short Answer</strong></p>

<p>Your <code>i</code> will be <em>converted</em> to an unsigned integer by adding <code>UINT_MAX + 1</code>, then the addition will be carried out with the unsigned values, resulting in a large <code>result</code> (depending on the values of <code>u</code> and <code>i</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Long Answer</strong></p>

<p>According to the C99 Standard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6.3.1.8 Usual arithmetic conversions</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>If both operands have the same type, then no further conversion is needed.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types, the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type, then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>In your case, we have one unsigned int (<code>u</code>) and signed int (<code>i</code>). Referring to (3) above, since both operands have the same rank, your <code>i</code> will need to be <em>converted</em> to an unsigned integer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6.3.1.3 Signed and unsigned integers</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>When a value with integer type is converted to another integer type other than _Bool, if the value can be represented by the new type, it is unchanged.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until the value is in the range of the new type.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the new type is signed and the value cannot be represented in it; either the result is implementation-defined or an implementation-defined signal is raised.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we need to refer to (2) above. Your <code>i</code> will be converted to an unsigned value by adding <code>UINT_MAX + 1</code>. So the result will depend on how <code>UINT_MAX</code> is defined on your implementation. It will be large, but it will not overflow, because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6.2.5 (9)</p>
  
  <p>A computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow, because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type.</p>

"Correct format specifier to print pointer (address)?","137761","","<p>Which format specifier should I be using to print the address of a variable? I am confused between the below lot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>%u - unsigned integer</p>
  
  <p>%x - hexadecimal value</p>
  
  <p>%p - void pointer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which would be the optimum format to print an address?</p>
","<p>The simplest answer, assuming you don't mind the vagaries and variations in format between different platforms, is the standard <code>%p</code> notation.</p>

<p>The C99 standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1999) says in §7.19.6.1 ¶8:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>p</code> The argument shall be a pointer to <code>void</code>. The value of the pointer is
  converted to a sequence of printing characters, in an implementation-defined
  manner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(In C11 — ISO/IEC 9899:2011 — the information is in §7.21.6.1 ¶8.)</p>

<p>On some platforms, that will include a leading <code>0x</code> and on others it won't, and the letters could be in lower-case or upper-case, and the C standard doesn't even define that it shall be hexadecimal output though I know of no implementation where it is not.</p>

<p>It is somewhat open to debate whether you should explicitly convert the pointers with a <code>(void *)</code> cast.  It is being explicit, which is usually good (so it is what I do), and the standard says 'the argument shall be a pointer to <code>void</code>'.  On most machines, you would get away with omitting an explicit cast.  However, it would matter on a machine where the bit representation of a <code>char *</code> address for a given memory location is different from the '<em>anything else pointer</em>' address for the same memory location.  This would be a word-addressed, instead of byte-addressed, machine.  Such machines are not common (probably not available) these days, but the first machine I worked on after university was one such (ICL Perq).</p>

<p>If you aren't happy with the implementation-defined behaviour of <code>%p</code>, then use C99 <code>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code> and <code>uintptr_t</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""0x%"" PRIXPTR ""\n"", (uintptr_t)your_pointer);
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to fine-tune the representation to suit yourself.  I chose to have the hex digits in upper-case so that the number is uniformly the same height and the characteristic dip at the start of <code>0xA1B2CDEF</code> appears thus, not like <code>0xa1b2cdef</code> which dips up and down along the number too.  Your choice though, within very broad limits.  The <code>(uintptr_t)</code> cast is unambiguously recommended by GCC when it can read the format string at compile time.  I think it is correct to request the cast, though I'm sure there are some who would ignore the warning and get away with it most of the time.</p>

<p>Kerrek asks in the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm a bit confused about standard promotions and variadic arguments. Do all pointers get standard-promoted to void*? Otherwise, if <code>int*</code> were, say, two bytes, and <code>void*</code> were 4 bytes, then it'd clearly be an error to read four bytes from the argument, non?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was under the illusion that the C standard says that all object pointers must be the same size, so <code>void *</code> and <code>int *</code> cannot be different sizes.  However, what I think is the relevant section of the C99 standard is not so emphatic (though I don't know of an implementation where what I suggested is true is actually false):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>§6.2.5 Types</p>
  
  <p>¶26 A pointer to void shall have the same representation and alignment requirements as a pointer to a character type.<sup>39)</sup> Similarly, pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of compatible types shall have the same representation and alignment requirements. All pointers to structure types shall have the same representation and alignment requirements as each other. All pointers to union types shall have the same representation and alignment requirements as each other. Pointers to other types need not have the same representation or alignment requirements.</p>
  
  <p><sup>39)</sup> The same representation and alignment requirements are meant to imply interchangeability as arguments to functions, return values from functions, and members of unions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(C11 says exactly the same in the section §6.2.5, ¶28, and footnote 48.)</p>

<p>So, all pointers to structures must be the same size as each other, and must share the same alignment requirements, even though the structures the pointers point at may have different alignment requirements.  Similarly for unions.  Character pointers and void pointers must have the same size and alignment requirements.  Pointers to variations on <code>int</code> (meaning <code>unsigned int</code> and <code>signed int</code>) must have the same size and alignment requirements as each other; similarly for other types.  But the C standard doesn't formally say that <code>sizeof(int *) == sizeof(void *)</code>.  Oh well, SO is good for making you inspect your assumptions.</p>

<p>The C standard definitively does not require function pointers to be the same size as object pointers.  That was necessary not to break the different memory models on DOS-like systems.  There you could have 16-bit data pointers but 32-bit function pointers, or vice versa.  This is why the C standard does not mandate that function pointers can be converted to object pointers and vice versa.</p>

<p>Fortunately (for programmers targetting POSIX), POSIX steps into the breach and does mandate that function pointers and data pointers are the same size:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>§2.12.3 <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_12"">Pointer Types</a></p>
  
  <p>All function pointer types shall have the same representation as the type pointer to void. Conversion of a function pointer to <code>void *</code> shall not alter the representation. A <code>void *</code> value resulting from such a conversion can be converted back to the original function pointer type, using an explicit cast, without loss of information.</p>
  
  <p>Note:
  The ISO C standard does not require this, but it is required for POSIX conformance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it does seem that explicit casts to <code>void *</code> are strongly advisable for maximum reliability in the code when passing a pointer to a variadic function such as <code>printf()</code>.  On POSIX systems, it is safe to cast a function pointer to a void pointer for printing.  On other systems, it is not necessarily safe to do that, nor is it necessarily safe to pass pointers other than <code>void *</code> without a cast.</p>

<p>All that is how C treats these variables (or how C++ treats namespace variables). In C++, a member marked <code>static</code> is shared by all instances of a given class.

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>No, you're <em>not</em> allocating memory for <code>y-&gt;x</code> twice.</p>

<p>Instead, you're allocating memory for the structure (which includes a pointer) <em>plus</em> something for that pointer to point to.</p>

<p>Think of it this way:</p>

<pre><code>         1          2
        +-----+    +------+
y------&gt;|  x------&gt;|  *x  |

<p>So you actually need the two allocations (<code>1</code> and <code>2</code>) to store everything.</p>

<p>Additionally, your type should be <code>struct Vector *y</code> since it's a pointer, and you should never cast the return value from <code>malloc</code> in C since it can hide certain problems you don't want hidden - C is perfectly capable of implicitly converting the <code>void*</code> return value to any other pointer.</p>

<p>And, of course, you probably want to encapsulate the creation of these vectors to make management of them easier, such as with:</p>

<pre><code>struct Vector {
    double *data;    // no place for x and n in readable code :-)
    size_t size;
};

struct Vector *newVector (size_t sz) {
    // Try to allocate vector structure.

    struct Vector *retVal = malloc (sizeof (struct Vector));
    if (retval == NULL)
        return NULL;

    // Try to allocate vector data, free structure if fail.

    retVal-&gt;data = malloc (sz * sizeof (double));
    if (retVal-&gt;data == NULL) {
        free (retVal);
        return NULL;

    // Set size and return.

    retVal-&gt;size = sz;

    if (vector != NULL) {
        free (vector-&gt;data);
        free (vector);
    }
}

<p>By encapsulating the creation like that, you ensure that vectors are either fully built or not built at all - there's no chance of them being half-built.

In many cases tools return as the exit status the number of errors they found. When you build your program, many separate tools may be run to create the final executable. One of those tools is ""ld"", which first reports the error it found (clrscr reference missing), and then it returns the exit status to its caller.

<p>Could anyone explain me what <code>ebp</code> and <code>esp</code> are in this context?</p>

<p>From what I see, I'd say the stack pointer points always to the top of the stack, and the base pointer to the beginning of the the current function? Or what?</p>

<hr>

<p>edit: I mean this in the context of windows programs</p>

<p><strong>edit2: And how does <code>eip</code> work, too?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>(editor's note: removed a long quote from Michael's answer, which doesn't belong in the question, but a followup question was edited in):</p>

<p>This is because the flow of the function call is:</p>

<pre><code>* Push parameters (hInstance, etc.)
* Call function, which pushes return address
* Push ebp
* Allocate space for locals
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My question (last, i hope!) now is, what is exactly what happens from the instant I pop the arguments of the function i want to call up to the end of the prolog? I want to know how the ebp, esp evolve during those moments(I already understood how the prolog works, I just want to know what is happening after i pushed the arguments on the stack and before the prolog).</strong></p>
","<p><code>esp</code> is as you say it is, the top of the stack.</p>

<p><code>ebp</code> is usually set to <code>esp</code> at the start of the function. Function parameters and local variables are accessed by adding and subtracting, respectively, a constant offset from <code>ebp</code>.  All x86 calling conventions define <code>ebp</code> as being preserved across function calls.  <code>ebp</code> itself actually points to the previous frame's base pointer, which enables stack walking in a debugger and viewing other frames local variables to work.  </p>

<p>Most function prologs look something like:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>push ebp      ; Preserve current frame pointer
mov ebp, esp  ; Create new frame pointer pointing to current stack top
sub esp, 20   ; allocate 20 bytes worth of locals on stack.
</code></pre>

<p>Then later in the function you may have code like (presuming both local variables are 4 bytes)</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>mov [ebp-4], eax    ; Store eax in first local
mov ebx, [ebp - 8]  ; Load ebx from second local
</code></pre>

<p>FPO or <em>frame pointer omission</em> optimization which you can enable will actually eliminate this and use <code>ebp</code> as another register and access locals directly off of <code>esp</code>, but this makes debugging a bit more difficult since the debugger can no longer directly access the stack frames of earlier function calls.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>For your updated question, the missing two entries in the stack are:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>var_C = dword ptr -0Ch
var_8 = dword ptr -8
var_4 = dword ptr -4
*savedFramePointer = dword ptr 0*
*return address = dword ptr 4*
hInstance = dword ptr  8h
PrevInstance = dword ptr  0C
hlpCmdLine = dword ptr  10h
nShowCmd = dword ptr  14h

<p>I heard that all character sets store the numbers in consecutive order so I assume so, but I'd like to know if there is an organized library function to do this conversion, and how it is done conventionally. I'm a real beginner :)</p>
","<p>Yes, this is a safe conversion. C requires it to work. This guarantee is in section 5.2.1 paragraph 2 of the latest ISO C standard, a recent draft of which is <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">N1570</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both the basic source and basic execution character sets shall have the following
  members:<br>
  [...]<br>
  the 10 decimal <em>digits</em><br>
         <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code><br>
  [...]<br>
  In both the source and execution basic character sets, the
  value of each character after 0 in the above list of decimal digits shall be one greater than
  the value of the previous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both ASCII and EBCDIC, and character sets derived from them, satisfy this requirement, which is why the C standard was able to impose it. Note that letters are <em>not</em> contiguous iN EBCDIC, and C doesn't require them to be.</p>

<p>There is no library function to do it for a single <code>char</code>, you would need to build a string first:</p>

<pre><code>int digit_to_int(char d)
{
 char str[2];

 str[0] = d;
 str[1] = '\0';
 return (int) strtol(str, NULL, 10);
}

<p>You could also use the <code><a href=""http://www.manpagez.com/man/3/atoi/"" rel=""noreferrer"">atoi()</a></code> function to do the conversion, once you have a string, but <code><a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/3/strtol"" rel=""noreferrer"">strtol()</a></code> is better and safer.</p>

<p>As commenters have pointed out though, it is extreme overkill to call a function to do this conversion; your initial approach to subtract '0' is the proper way of doing this.

"C #define macro for debug printing","134392","","<p>Trying to create a macro which can be used for print debug messages when DEBUG is defined, like the following pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>#define DEBUG 1
#define debug_print(args ...) if (DEBUG) fprintf(stderr, args)
</code></pre>

<p>How is this accomplished with a macro?</p>
","<h3>If you use a C99 compiler</h3>

<pre><code>#define debug_print(fmt, ...) \
            do { if (DEBUG) fprintf(stderr, fmt, __VA_ARGS__); } while (0)
</code></pre>

<p>It assumes you are using C99 (the variable argument list notation is not supported in earlier versions).  The <code>do { ... } while (0)</code> idiom ensures that the code acts like a statement (function call).  The unconditional use of the code ensures that the compiler always checks that your debug code is valid &mdash; but the optimizer will remove the code when DEBUG is 0.</p>

<p>If you want to work with #ifdef DEBUG, then change the test condition:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef DEBUG
#define DEBUG_TEST 1
#else
#define DEBUG_TEST 0
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>And then use DEBUG_TEST where I used DEBUG.</p>

<p>If you insist on a string literal for the format string (probably a good idea anyway), you can also introduce things like <code>__FILE__</code>, <code>__LINE__</code> and <code>__func__</code> into the output, which can improve the diagnostics:</p>

<pre><code>#define debug_print(fmt, ...) \
        do { if (DEBUG) fprintf(stderr, ""%s:%d:%s(): "" fmt, __FILE__, \
                                __LINE__, __func__, __VA_ARGS__); } while (0)
</code></pre>

<p>This relies on string concatenation to create a bigger format string than the programmer writes.</p>

<h3>If you use a C89 compiler</h3>

<p>If you are stuck with C89 and no useful compiler extension, then there isn't a particularly clean way to handle it.  The technique I used to use was:</p>

<pre><code>#define TRACE(x) do { if (DEBUG) dbg_printf x; } while (0)
</code></pre>

<p>And then, in the code, write:</p>

<pre><code>TRACE((""message %d\n"", var));
</code></pre>

<p>The double-parentheses are crucial &mdash; and are why you have the funny notation in the macro expansion.  As before, the compiler always checks the code for syntactic validity (which is good) but the optimizer only invokes the printing function if the DEBUG macro evaluates to non-zero.</p>

<p>This does require a support function &mdash; dbg_printf() in the example &mdash; to handle things like 'stderr'.  It requires you to know how to write varargs functions, but that isn't hard:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void dbg_printf(const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list args;
    va_start(args, fmt);
    vfprintf(stderr, fmt, args);
    va_end(args);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use this technique in C99, of course, but the <code>__VA_ARGS__</code> technique is neater because it uses regular function notation, not the double-parentheses hack.</p>

<h3>Why is it crucial that the compiler always see the debug code?</h3>

<p>[<em>Rehashing comments made to another answer.</em>]</p>

<p>One central idea behind both the C99 and C89 implementations above is that the compiler proper always sees the debugging printf-like statements.  This is important for long-term code &mdash; code that will last a decade or two.</p>

<p>Suppose a piece of code has been mostly dormant (stable) for a number of years, but now needs to be changed.  You re-enable debugging trace - but it is frustrating to have to debug the debugging (tracing) code because it refers to variables that have been renamed or retyped, during the years of stable maintenance. If the compiler (post pre-processor) always sees the print statement, it ensures that any surrounding changes have not invalidated the diagnostics. If the compiler does not see the print statement, it cannot protect you against your own carelessness (or the carelessness of your colleagues or collaborators). See '<a href=""http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/tpop.webpage/"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Practice of Programming</a>' by Kernighan and Pike, especially Chapter 8 (see also Wikipedia on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Programming#External_links"" rel=""noreferrer"">TPOP</a>). </p>

<p>This is 'been there, done that' experience &mdash; I used essentially the technique described in other answers where the non-debug build does not see the printf-like statements for a number of years (more than a decade). But I came across the advice in TPOP (see my previous comment), and then did enable some debugging code after a number of years, and ran into problems of changed context breaking the debugging. Several times, having the printing always validated has saved me from later problems.</p>

<p>I use NDEBUG to control assertions only, and a separate macro (usually DEBUG) to control whether debug tracing is built into the program. Even when the debug tracing is built in, I frequently do not want debug output to appear unconditionally, so I have mechanism to control whether the output appears (debug levels, and instead of calling fprintf() directly, I call a debug print function that only conditionally prints so the same build of the code can print or not print based on program options).  I also have a 'multiple-subsystem' version of the code for bigger programs, so that I can have different sections of the program producing different amounts of trace - under runtime control.</p>

<p>I am advocating that for all builds, the compiler should see the diagnostic statements; however, the compiler won't generate any code for the debugging trace statements unless debug is enabled.  Basically, it means that all of your code is checked by the compiler every time you compile - whether for release or debugging.  This is a good thing!</p>

<h3>Single argument C99 variant</h3>

<p>Kyle Brandt asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyway to do this so <code>debug_print</code> still works even if there are no arguments? For example:</p>

<pre><code>    debug_print(""Foo"");
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>There's one simple, old-fashioned hack:</p>

<pre><code>debug_print(""%s\n"", ""Foo"");
</code></pre>

<p>The GCC-only solution also provides support for that.</p>

<p>However, you can do it with the straight C99 system by using:</p>

<pre><code>#define debug_print(...) \
            do { if (DEBUG) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__); } while (0)
</code></pre>

<p>Compared to the first version, you lose the limited checking that requires the 'fmt' argument, which means that someone could call 'debug_print()' with no arguments.  Whether the loss of checking is a problem at all is debatable.</p>

<h3>GCC-specific Technique</h3>

<p>Some compilers may offer extensions for other ways of handling variable-length argument lists in macros.  Specifically, as first noted in the comments by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/558647/hugo-ideler"">Hugo Ideler</a>, GCC allows you to omit the comma that would normally appear after the last 'fixed' argument to the macro.  It also allows you to use <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Variadic-Macros.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>##__VA_ARGS__</code></a> in the macro replacement text, which deletes the comma preceding the notation if, but only if, the previous token is a comma:</p>

<pre><code>#define debug_print(fmt, ...) \
            do { if (DEBUG) fprintf(stderr, fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__); } while (0)
</code></pre>

<p>This solution retains the benefit of requiring the format argument while accepting optional arguments after the format.</p>

<p>This technique is also supported by <a href=""https://clang.llvm.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Clang</a> for GCC compatibility.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Why the do-while loop?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's the purpose of the <code>do while</code> here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to be able to use the macro so it looks like a function call, which means it will be followed by a semi-colon.  Therefore, you have to package the macro body to suit.  If you use an <code>if</code> statement without the surrounding <code>do { ... } while (0)</code>, you will have:</p>

<pre><code>/* BAD - BAD - BAD */
#define debug_print(...) \
            if (DEBUG) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, suppose you write:</p>

<pre><code>if (x &gt; y)
    debug_print(""x (%d) &gt; y (%d)\n"", x, y);
else
    do_something_useful(x, y);
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, that indentation doesn't reflect the actual control of flow, because the preprocessor produces code equivalent to this (indented and braces added to emphasize the actual meaning):</p>

<pre><code>if (x &gt; y)
{
    if (DEBUG)
        fprintf(stderr, ""x (%d) &gt; y (%d)\n"", x, y);
    else
        do_something_useful(x, y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The next attempt at the macro might be:</p>

<pre><code>/* BAD - BAD - BAD */
#define debug_print(...) \
            if (DEBUG) { fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__); }
</code></pre>

<p>And the same code fragment now produces:</p>

<pre><code>if (x &gt; y)
    if (DEBUG)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, ""x (%d) &gt; y (%d)\n"", x, y);
    }
; // Null statement from semi-colon after macro
else
    do_something_useful(x, y);
</code></pre>

<p>And the <code>else</code> is now a syntax error.  The <code>do { ... } while(0)</code> loop avoids both these problems.</p>

<p>There's one other way of writing the macro which might work:</p>

<pre><code>/* BAD - BAD - BAD */
#define debug_print(...) \
            ((void)((DEBUG) ? fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__) : 0))
</code></pre>

<p>This leaves the program fragment shown as valid.  The <code>(void)</code> cast prevents it being used in contexts where a value is required &mdash; but it could be used as the left operand of a comma operator where the <code>do { ... } while (0)</code> version cannot.  If you think you should be able to embed debug code into such expressions, you might prefer this.  If you prefer to require the debug print to act as a full statement, then the <code>do { ... } while (0)</code> version is better.  Note that if the body of the macro involved any semi-colons (roughly speaking), then you can only use the <code>do { ... } while(0)</code> notation.  It always works; the expression statement mechanism can be more difficult to apply.  You might also get warnings from the compiler with the expression form that you'd prefer to avoid; it will depend on the compiler and the flags you use.</p>

"How to set socket timeout in C when making multiple connections?","132909","","<p>I'm writing a simple program that makes multiple connections to different servers for status check. All these connections are constructed on-demand; up to 10 connections can be created simultaneously. I don't like the idea of one-thread-per-socket, so I made all these client sockets Non-Blocking, and throw them into a select() pool.</p>

<p>It worked great, until my client complained that the waiting time is too long before they can get the error report when target servers stopped responding.</p>

<p>I've checked several topics in the forum. Some had suggested that one can use alarm() signal or set a timeout in the select() function call. But I'm dealing with multiple connections, instead of one. When a process wide timeout signal happens, I've no way to distinguish the timeout connection among all the other connections.</p>

<p>Is there anyway to change the system-default timeout duration ? </p>
","<p>You can use the SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO socket options to set timeouts for any socket operations, like so:</p>

<pre><code>    struct timeval timeout;      
    timeout.tv_sec = 10;
    timeout.tv_usec = 0;

    if (setsockopt (sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, (char *)&amp;timeout,
                sizeof(timeout)) &lt; 0)
        error(""setsockopt failed\n"");

<p><code>SO_SNDTIMEO</code> is an option to set a timeout value for output operations. It accepts a struct timeval parameter with the number of seconds and microseconds used to limit waits for output operations to complete.  If a send operation has blocked for this much time, it returns with a partial count or with the error EWOULDBLOCK if no data were sent.  In the current implementation, this timer is restarted each time additional data are delivered to the protocol, implying that the limit applies to output portions ranging in size from the low-water mark to the high-water mark for output.</p>

<p><code>SO_RCVTIMEO</code> is an option to set a timeout value for input operations. It accepts a struct timeval parameter with the number of seconds and microseconds used to limit waits for input operations to complete.

"Pointers in C: when to use the ampersand and the asterisk?","132030","","<p>I'm just starting out with pointers, and I'm slightly confused. I know <code>&amp;</code> means the address of a variable and that <code>*</code> can be used in front of a pointer variable to get the value of the object that is pointed to by the pointer. But things work differently when you're working with arrays, strings or when you're calling functions with a pointer copy of a variable. It's difficult to see a pattern of logic inside all of this.</p>

<p>When should I use <code>&amp;</code> and <code>*</code>?</p>
","<p>You have pointers and values:</p>

<pre><code>int* p; // variable p is pointer to integer type
int i; // integer value
</code></pre>

<p>You turn a pointer into a value with <code>*</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int i2 = *p; // integer i2 is assigned with integer value that pointer p is pointing to
</code></pre>

<p>You turn a value into a pointer with <code>&amp;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int* p2 = &amp;i; // pointer p2 will point to the address of integer i
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:
In the case of arrays, they are treated very much like pointers.  If you think of them as pointers, you'll be using <code>*</code> to get at the values inside of them as explained above, but there is also another, more common way using the <code>[]</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>int a[2];  // array of integers
int i = *a; // the value of the first element of a
int i2 = a[0]; // another way to get the first element

<pre><code>int a[2]; // array
int i = *(a + 1); // the value of the second element
int i2 = a[1]; // the value of the second element

<p>So the <code>[]</code> indexing operator is a special form of the <code>*</code> operator, and it works like this:</p>

","<p>First, the * operator takes precedence over the ++ operator, and the () operators take precedence over everything else. EDIT(things are more complicated than that, see bottom edit)</p>

<p>Second, the ++number operator is the same as the number++ operator if you're not assigning them to anything. The difference is number++ returns number and then increments number, and ++number increments first and then returns it.</p>

<p>Third, by increasing the value of a pointer, you're incrementing it by the sizeof its contents, that is you're incrementing it as if you were iterating in an array.</p>

*ptr++;   // Pointer moves to the next int position (as if it was an array). But returns the old content
(*ptr)++; // The value of ptr is incremented
*(ptr)++; // Pointer moves to the next int position (as if it was an array). But returns the old content
*++ptr;   // Pointer moves to the next int position, and then get's accessed, with your code, segfault

"Flushing buffers in C","131455","","<p>Should <code>fflush()</code> not be used to flush a buffer even if it is an output stream?</p>

<p>What is it useful for? How do we flush a buffer in general?</p>
","<p>I've never heard not to flush the output buffer, and I would be interested to hear your source on that. Flushing the output buffers:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""Buffered, will be flushed"");
fflush(stdout); // Prints to screen or whatever your standard out is
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>fprintf(fd, ""Buffered, will be flushed"");
fflush(fd);  //Prints to a file
</code></pre>

<p>Can be a very helpful technique. Why would you want to flush an output buffer? Usually when I do it, it's because the code is crashing and I'm trying to debug something. The standard buffer will not print everytime you call <code>printf()</code> it waits until it's full then dumps a bunch at once. So if you're trying to check if you're making it to a function call before a crash, it's helpful to <code>printf</code> something like ""got here!"", and sometimes the buffer hasn't been flushed before the crash happens and you can't tell how far you've really gotten.</p>

<p>Another time that it's helpful, is in multi-process or multi-thread code. Again, the buffer doesn't always flush on a call to a <code>printf()</code>, so if you want to know the true order of execution of multiple processes you should fflush the buffer after every print.</p>

<p>I make a habit to do it, it saves me a lot of headache in debugging. The only downside I can think of to doing so is that <code>printf()</code> is an expensive operation (which is why it doesn't by default flush the buffer).</p>

<hr>

<p>As far as flushing the input buffer (<code>stdin</code>), you should not do that. Flushing <code>stdin</code> is undefined behavior according to the C11 standard §7.21.5.2 part 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If stream points to an output stream ... the fflush function causes any unwritten data for that stream ... to be written to the file; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On some systems, Linux being one as you can see in the man page for <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/3/fflush""><code>fflush()</code></a>, there's a defined behavior but it's system dependent so your code will not be portable.</p>

<p>Now if you're worried about garbage ""stuck"" in the input buffer you can use <code>fpurge()</code> on that.

{
  if (str)

      XOR_SWAP(*str, *end);
      str++;
      end--;
    }
#   undef XOR_SWAP
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A <strong>pointer</strong> (e.g. <code>char *</code>, read from right-to-left as a <em>pointer to a <code>char</code></em>) is a data type in C that is used
to refer to location in memory of another value.  In this case,
the location where a <code>char</code> is stored.  We can <em>dereference</em>
pointers by prefixing them with an <code>*</code>, which gives us the value
stored at that location.  So the value stored at <code>str</code> is <code>*str</code>.</p>

<p>We can do simple arithmetic with pointers.  When we increment (or decrement)
a pointer, we simply move it to refer to the next (or previous)
memory location for that type of value.  Incrementing pointers of
different types may move the pointer by a different number of
bytes because different values have different byte sizes in C.</p>

<p>Here, we use one pointer to refer to the first unprocessed
<code>char</code> of the string (<code>str</code>) and another to refer to the last (<code>end</code>).
We swap their values (<code>*str</code> and <code>*end</code>), and move the pointers
inwards to the middle of the string.  Once <code>str &gt;= end</code>, either
they both point to the same <code>char</code>, which means our original string had an
odd length (and the middle <code>char</code> doesn't need to be reversed), or
we've processed everything.</p>

<p>To do the swapping, I've defined a <strong>macro</strong>.  Macros are text substitution
done by the C preprocessor.  They are very different from functions,
and it's important to know the difference.  When you call a function,
the function operates on a copy of the values you give it.  When you call
a macro, it simply does a textual substitution - so the arguments you give
it are used directly.</p>

<p>Since I only used the <code>XOR_SWAP</code> macro once, it was probably overkill to define it,
but it made more clear what I was doing.  After the C preprocessor expands the macro,
the while loop looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    while (str &lt; end)
    {
      do { *str ^= *end; *end ^= *str; *str ^= *end; } while (0);
      str++;
      end--;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the macro arguments show up once for each time they're used in the 
macro definition.   This can be very useful - but can also break your code
if used incorrectly.  For example, if I had compressed the increment/decrement
instructions and the macro call into a single line, like</p>

<pre><code>      XOR_SWAP(*str++, *end--);
</code></pre>

<p>Then this would expand to</p>

<pre><code>      do { *str++ ^= *end--; *end-- ^= *str++; *str++ ^= *end--; } while (0);
</code></pre>

<p>Which has <em>triple</em> the increment/decrement operations, and doesn't actually
do the swap it's supposed to do.</p>

<p>While we're on the subject, you should know what <strong>xor</strong> (<code>^</code>) means.  It's a basic
arithmetic operation - like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, except
it's not usually taught in elementary school.  It combines two integers bit by bit
- like addition, but we don't care about the carry-overs.  <code>1^1 = 0</code>, <code>1^0 = 1</code>,
<code>0^1 = 1</code>, <code>0^0 = 0</code>.</p>

<p>A well known trick is to use xor to swap two values.  This works because of three basic
properties of xor: <code>x ^ 0 = x</code>, <code>x ^ x = 0</code> and <code>x ^ y = y ^ x</code> for all values <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.  So say we have two
variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> that are initially storing two values
<code>v<sub>a</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>b</sub></code>.</p>

<pre>
  // initially:
  // a == v<sub>a</sub>
  // b == v<sub>b</sub>
  a ^= b;
  // now: a == v<sub>a</sub> ^ v<sub>b</sub>
  b ^= a;
  // now: b == v<sub>b</sub> ^ (v<sub>a</sub> ^ v<sub>b</sub>)
  //        == v<sub>a</sub> ^ (v<sub>b</sub> ^ v<sub>b</sub>)
  //        == v<sub>a</sub> ^ 0
  //        == v<sub>a</sub>
  a ^= b;
  // now: a == (v<sub>a</sub> ^ v<sub>b</sub>) ^ v<sub>a</sub>
  //        == (v<sub>a</sub> ^ v<sub>a</sub>) ^ v<sub>b</sub>
  //        == 0 ^ v<sub>b</sub>
  //        == v<sub>b</sub>
</pre>

<p>So the values are swapped.  This does have one bug - when <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are the same variable:</p>

<pre>
  // initially:
  // a == v<sub>a</sub>
  a ^= a;
  // now: a == v<sub>a</sub> ^ v<sub>a</sub>
  //        == 0
  a ^= a;
  // now: a == 0 ^ 0
  //        == 0
  a ^= a;
  // now: a == 0 ^ 0
  //        == 0
</pre>

<p>Since we <code>str &lt; end</code>, this never happens in the above code, so we're okay.</p>

<p>While we're concerned about correctness we should check our edge cases.  The <code>if (str)</code> line should make sure we weren't given a <code>NULL</code> pointer for string.  What about the empty string <code>""""</code>?  Well <code>strlen("""") == 0</code>, so we'll initialize <code>end</code> as <code>str - 1</code>, which means that the <code>while (str &lt; end)</code> condition is never true, so we don't do anything.  Which is correct.</p>

<p>There's a bunch of C to explore.  Have fun with it!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/92202/mmw"">mmw</a> brings up a good point, which is you do have to be slightly careful how you invoke this, as it does operate in-place.</p>

<pre><code> char stack_string[] = ""This string is copied onto the stack."";
 inplace_reverse(stack_string);
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, since <code>stack_string</code> is an array, whose contents are initialized to the given string constant.  However</p>

<pre><code> char * string_literal = ""This string is part of the executable."";
 inplace_reverse(string_literal);
</code></pre>

<p>Will cause your code to flame and die at runtime.  That's because <code>string_literal</code> merely points to the string that is stored as part of your executable - which is normally memory that you are not allowed to edit by the OS.  In a happier world, your compiler would know this, and cough an error when you tried to compile, telling you that <code>string_literal</code> needs to be of type <code>char const *</code> since you can't modify the contents.  However, this is not the world my compiler lives in.</p>

<p>There are some hacks you could try to make sure that some memory is on the stack or in the heap (and is therefore editable), but they're not necessarily portable, and it could be pretty ugly.  However, I'm more than happy to throw responsibility for this to the function invoker.  I've told them that this function does in place memory manipulation, it's their responsibility to give me an argument that allows that.</p>

<p>Summary (label changed from original to make intent even clearer):</p>

<pre><code>infinite_loop:

    // code goes here

goto infinite_loop;
</code></pre>

<p>Why it's better than the alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's specific.  <code>goto</code> is the
language construct which causes an
unconditional branch.  Alternatives
depend on using structures
supporting conditional branches,
with a degenerate always-true
condition.</li>
<li>The label documents the intent
without extra comments.</li>
<li>The reader doesn't have to scan the
intervening code for early <code>break</code>s
(although it's still possible for an
unprincipled hacker to simulate
<code>continue</code> with an early <code>goto</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pretend that the gotophobes didn't
win.  It's understood that the above
can't be used in real code because
it goes against established idiom.</li>
<li>Assume that we have all heard of
'Goto considered harmful' and know
that goto can be used to write
spaghetti code.</li>
<li>If you disagree with an example,
criticize it on technical merit
alone ('Because people don't like
goto' is not a technical reason).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's see if we can talk about this like grown ups.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>This question seems finished now.  It generated some high quality answers.  Thanks to everyone,
 especially those who took my little loop example seriously.  Most skeptics were concerned
 by the lack of block scope.  As @quinmars pointed out in a comment, you can always put braces around the 
loop body.  I note in passing that <code>for(;;)</code> and <code>while(true)</code> don't give you the braces 
for free either (and omitting them can cause vexing bugs).  Anyway, I won't waste any more
of your brain power on this trifle - I can live with the harmless and idiomatic <code>for(;;)</code> and <code>while(true)</code> (just as well if I want to keep my job).  </p>

<p>Considering the other responses, I see that many people view <code>goto</code> as something you always 
have to rewrite in another way.  Of course you can avoid a <code>goto</code> by introducing a loop,
 an extra flag, a stack of nested <code>if</code>s, or whatever, but why not consider whether <code>goto</code> is 
perhaps the best tool for the job? Put another way, how much ugliness are people prepared to endure to avoid using a built-in language feature for its intended purpose? My take is that
even adding a flag is too high a price to pay.  I like my variables to represent things in 
the problem or solution domains. 'Solely to avoid a <code>goto</code>' doesn't cut it.</p>

<p>I'll accept the first answer which gave the C pattern for branching to a cleanup block. IMO, this makes the strongest case for a <code>goto</code> of all the posted answers, certainly 
if you measure it by the contortions a hater has to go through to avoid it.</p>
","<p>Heres one trick I've heard of people using. I've never seen it in the wild though. And it only applies to C because C++ has RAII to do this more idiomatically. </p>

<pre><code>void foo()
{
    if (!doA())
        goto exit;
    if (!doB())
        goto cleanupA;
    if (!doC())
        goto cleanupB;

    /* everything has succeeded */
    return;

cleanupB:
    undoB();
cleanupA:
    undoA();
exit:
    return;

"What is the best IDE for C Development / Why use Emacs over an IDE?","129879","","<p>so as per one of my previous questions, I'm brushing up on my C skills.</p>

<p><strong>My question is, what do people use for developing C?</strong></p>

<p>Lots of people use Emacs, and have done so for years, but <strong>is it better to learn emacs than just use an IDE</strong> such as Geany or KDevelop?</p>

<p>Would also be interested to hear from those <strong>still using emacs</strong>, and <strong>why they use it</strong> over other apps?</p>

<p>Please note that I'm only really interested in the <strong>free IDEs / editors</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for posting links which answer some of my questions, but I guess what I'm really wondering about is:</p>

<p>Whether learning to edit using emacs / vim and compiling / debugging using the gcc-toolchain is worth it instead of just using an IDE, and why?</p>

<p>What are peoples reasons for not migrating to an IDE?</p>

<p>Has anyone moved from terminal-centric development to IDE development, and why did they move?</p>
","<p>I started off by using IDEs, Microsoft or not. Then, while working on QNX some long time ago, I was forced to do with a text editor + compiler/linker. Now I prefer this simple combination––a syntax highlighting editor + C compiler and linker cli + make––to any IDEs, even if environment allows for them.</p>

<p>The reasons are, for me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>it's everywhere. If you program in C, you do have the compiler, and usually you can get yourself an editor. The first thing I do––I get myself nedit on Linux or Notepad++ on Windows. I would go with vi, but GUI editors provide for a better fonts, and that is important when you look at code all day</p></li>
<li><p>you can program remotely, via ssh, when you need to. And it does help a lot sometimes to be able to ssh into the target and do some quick things there</p></li>
<li><p>it keeps me close to CLI, preferably UNIX/Linux CLI. So all the commands are on my fingertips, and when I need them I don't have to go read a reference book. And UNIX CLI can do things IDEs often can't––because their developers didn't think you'd need them</p></li>
<li><p>most importantly, it is very much like seeing the Matrix in raw code. I operate files, so I'm forced to keep them manageable. I'm finding things in my code manually, which makes me keep it simple and organized. I do Config Management explicitly, so I know when I'm synced and how. I know my Makefiles because I write them, and they only do what I tell them to</p>

<p>(if you wonder if that works in ""really big projects""––it does work, and the bigger the project the more performance it gains me)</p></li>

"Why isn't sizeof for a struct equal to the sum of sizeof of each member?","129392","","<p>Why does the 'sizeof' operator return a size larger for a structure than the total sizes of the structure's members?</p>
","<p>This is because of padding added to satisfy alignment constraints. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment"" rel=""noreferrer"">Data structure alignment</a> impacts both performance and correctness of programs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mis-aligned access might be a hard error (often <code>SIGBUS</code>).</li>
<li>Mis-aligned access might be a soft error.

<ul>
<li>Either corrected in hardware, for a modest performance-degradation.</li>
<li>Or corrected by emulation in software, for a severe performance-degradation.</li>
<li>In addition, atomicity and other concurrency-guarantees might be broken, leading to subtle errors.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example using typical settings for an x86 processor (all used 32 and 64 bit modes):</p>

<pre><code>struct X
{
    short s; /* 2 bytes */
             /* 2 padding bytes */
    int   i; /* 4 bytes */
    char  c; /* 1 byte */

struct Y

    int   i; /* 4 bytes */
    char  c; /* 1 byte */
             /* 1 padding byte */
    short s; /* 2 bytes */

struct Z

const int sizeX = sizeof(struct X); /* = 12 */
const int sizeY = sizeof(struct Y); /* = 8 */
const int sizeZ = sizeof(struct Z); /* = 8 */
</code></pre>

<p>One can minimize the size of structures by sorting members by alignment (sorting by size suffices for that in basic types) (like structure <code>Z</code> in the example above).</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Both the C and C++ standards state that structure alignment is implementation-defined.  Therefore each compiler may choose to align data differently, resulting in different and incompatible data layouts.  For this reason, when dealing with libraries that will be used by different compilers, it is important to understand how the compilers align data.  Some compilers have command-line settings and/or special <code>#pragma</code> statements to change the structure alignment settings.</p>

"Printf width specifier to maintain precision of floating-point value","128174","","<p>Is there a <code>printf</code> width specifier which can be applied to a floating point specifier that would automatically format the output to the necessary number of <em>significant digits</em> such that when scanning the string back in, the original floating point value is acquired?</p>

printf(""%.*e\n"", Digs, OneSeventh);

<hr>

<p>But let's dig deeper ...</p>

<p>Mathematically, the answer is ""0.142857 142857 142857 ..."", but we are using finite precision floating point numbers.
Let's assume <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format"">IEEE 754 double-precision binary</a>. 
So the <code>OneSeventh = 1.0/7.0</code> results in the value below.  Also shown are the preceding and following representable <code>double</code> floating point numbers.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Printing the <em>exact</em> decimal representation of a <code>double</code> has limited uses.</p>

<p>C has 2 families of macros in <code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code> to help us.<br>
The first set is the number of <em>significant</em> digits to print in a string in decimal so when scanning the string back,
we get the original floating point.  There are shown with the C spec's <em>minimum</em> value and a <em>sample</em> C11 compiler.</p>

<pre><code>FLT_DECIMAL_DIG   6,  9 (float)                           (C11)
DBL_DECIMAL_DIG  10, 17 (double)                          (C11)
LDBL_DECIMAL_DIG 10, 21 (long double)                     (C11)
DECIMAL_DIG      10, 21 (widest supported floating type)  (C99)
</code></pre>

<p>The second set is the number of <em>significant</em> digits a string may be scanned into a floating point and then the FP printed, still retaining the same string presentation.  There are shown with the C spec's <em>minimum</em> value and a <em>sample</em> C11 compiler.  I believe available pre-C99.</p>

<pre><code>FLT_DIG   6, 6 (float)
DBL_DIG  10, 15 (double)
LDBL_DIG 10, 18 (long double)
</code></pre>

<p>The first set of macros seems to meet OP's goal of <em>significant</em> digits.  But that <em>macro</em> is not always available.</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef DBL_DECIMAL_DIG
  #define OP_DBL_Digs (DBL_DECIMAL_DIG)
#else  
  #ifdef DECIMAL_DIG
    #define OP_DBL_Digs (DECIMAL_DIG)
  #else  
    #define OP_DBL_Digs (DBL_DIG + 3)
  #endif
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>The ""+ 3"" was the crux of my previous answer.
Its centered on if knowing the round-trip conversion string-FP-string (set #2 macros available C89), how would one determine the digits for FP-string-FP (set #1 macros available post C89)?  In general, add 3 was the result.</p>

<p>Now how many <em>significant</em> digits to print is known and driven via <code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code>.  </p>

<p>To print N <em>significant</em> decimal digits one may use various formats.  </p>

<p>With <code>""%e""</code>, the <em>precision</em> field is the number of digits <em>after</em> the lead digit and decimal point.
So <code>- 1</code> is in order.  Note: This <code>-1 is not in the initial</code>int Digs = DECIMAL_DIG;`</p>

<pre><code>printf(""%.*e\n"", OP_DBL_Digs - 1, OneSeventh);
// 1.4285714285714285e-01
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>""%f""</code>, the <em>precision</em> field is the number of digits <em>after</em> the decimal point.
For a number like <code>OneSeventh/1000000.0</code>, one would need <code>OP_DBL_Digs + 6</code> to see all the <em>significant</em> digits.</p>

<pre><code>printf(""%.*f\n"", OP_DBL_Digs    , OneSeventh);
// 0.14285714285714285
printf(""%.*f\n"", OP_DBL_Digs + 6, OneSeventh/1000000.0);
// 0.00000014285714285714285
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Many are use to <code>""%f""</code>.  That displays 6 digits after the decimal point; 6 is the display default, not the precision of the number.</p>

"Convert double/float to string","126891","","<p>I need to convert a floating point number to an equivalent string in decimal (or other base). Conversion at first needs to be done in the format <code>xE+0</code> where <code>x</code> is the floating point number.</p>

<p>The idea I have is to first truncate the floating point number into a temporary integer and then convert that integer into string, and then consider the fractional part, multiply it with <code>10</code> while the fractional part does not become <code>0</code>. After the fractional part is transferred into the left side of the decimal point, apply the integer to string function again and convert the fraction part to string. Is there a better way, which will be faster than this? Will this method induce any kind of side effects?</p>

<p>To convert the floating point number into exponential representation shall I do the same as above and then adjust the power? Or directly bitmask the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IEEE&nbsp;754</a> floating point representation and convert each part into string.</p>

<p>Rather than working with individual decimal digits, it's helpful to instead work base-1-billion (the highest power of 10 that fits in a 32-bit integer) and then convert these ""base-1-billion digits"" to 9 decimal digits each at the end of your computation.</p>

<p>It is the same when compiling C-programs with <code>gcc</code>.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup><strong>Please note:</strong> This question has been asked many times before, but each time it was specific to the askers situation. This question's purpose is <strong>to have a question that others can be closed as duplicates of</strong>, once and for all; a <em>FAQ</em>.</sup></p>
","<p>Your compiler just tried to compile the file named <code>foo.cc</code>. Upon hitting line number <code>line</code>, the compiler finds:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""bar""
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;bar&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler then tries to find that file. For this, it uses a set of directories to look into, but within this set, there is no file <code>bar</code>. For an explanation of the difference between the versions of the include statement look <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21593/what-is-the-difference-between-include-filename-and-include-filename"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>How to tell the compiler where to find it</h2>

<p><code>g++</code> has an option <code>-I</code>. It lets you add include search paths to the command line. Imagine that your file <code>bar</code> is in a folder named <code>frobnicate</code>, relative to <code>foo.cc</code> (assume you are compiling from the directory where <code>foo.cc</code> is located):</p>

<pre><code>g++ -Ifrobnicate foo.cc
</code></pre>

<p>You can add more include-paths; each you give is relative to the current directory. Microsoft's compiler has a correlating option <code>/I</code> that works in the same way, or in Visual Studio, the folders can be set in the Property Pages of the Project, under Configuration Properties->C/C++->General->Additional Include Directories.  </p>

<p>Now imagine you have multiple version of <code>bar</code> in different folders, given:</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>// A/bar
#include&lt;string&gt;
std::string which() { return ""A/bar""; }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>// B/bar
#include&lt;string&gt;
std::string which() { return ""B/bar""; }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>// C/bar
#include&lt;string&gt;
std::string which() { return ""C/bar""; }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>// foo.cc
#include ""bar""
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main () {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; which() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The priority with <code>#include ""bar""</code> is leftmost:</p>

<pre><code>$ g++ -IA -IB -IC foo.cc
$ ./a.out
A/bar
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, when the compiler started looking through <code>A/</code>, <code>B/</code> and <code>C/</code>, it stopped at the first or leftmost hit.</p>

<p>This is true of both forms, <code>include &lt;&gt;</code> and <code>incude """"</code>.</p>

<h2>Difference between <code>#include &lt;bar&gt;</code> and <code>#include ""bar""</code></h2>

<p>Usually, the <code>#include &lt;xxx&gt;</code> makes it look into system folders first, the <code>#include ""xxx""</code> makes it look into the current or custom folders first.</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>

<p>Imagine you have the following files in your project folder:</p>

<pre><code>list
main.cc
</code></pre>

<p>with <code>main.cc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""list""
....
</code></pre>

<p>For this, your compiler will <code>#include</code> the file <code>list</code> in your project folder, because it currently compiles <code>main.cc</code> and there is that file <code>list</code> in the current folder.</p>

<p>But with <code>main.cc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;list&gt;
....
</code></pre>

<p>and then <code>g++ main.cc</code>, your compiler will look into the system folders first, and because <code>&lt;list&gt;</code> is a standard header, it will <code>#include</code> the file named <code>list</code> that comes with your C++ platform as part of the standard library.</p>

<p>This is all a bit simplified, but should give you the basic idea.</p>

<h2>Details on <code>&lt;&gt;</code>/<code>""""</code>-priorities and <code>-I</code></h2>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Search-Path.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">gcc-documentation</a>, the priority for <code>include &lt;&gt;</code> is, on a ""normal Unix system"", as follows:</p>

<pre><code> /usr/local/include
 libdir/gcc/target/version/include
 /usr/target/include
 /usr/include
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>For C++ programs, it will also look in /usr/include/c++/version, first. In the above, target is the canonical name of the system GCC was configured to compile code for; [...]. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The documentation also states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can add to this list with the -Idir command line option. All the directories named by -I are searched, in left-to-right order, <strong>before the default directories</strong>. The only exception is when dir is already searched by default. In this case, the option is ignored and the search order for system directories remains unchanged. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To continue our <code>#include&lt;list&gt; / #include""list""</code> example (same code):</p>

<pre><code>g++ -I. main.cc
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;list&gt;
int main () { std::list&lt;int&gt; l; }
</code></pre>

<p>and indeed, the <code>-I.</code> prioritizes the folder <code>.</code> over the system includes and we get a compiler error.</p>

"C dynamically growing array","126780","","<p>I have a program that reads a ""raw"" list of in-game entities, and I intend to make an array holding an index number (int) of an indeterminate number of entities, for processing various things.

<p>A quick and dirty solution I use so far is to declare, in the main processing function (local focus) the array with a size of the maximum game entities, and another integer to keep track of how many have been added to the list.

","<blockquote>
  <p>I can use pointers, but I am a bit afraid of using them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need a dynamic array, you can't escape pointers. Why are you afraid though? They won't bite (as long as you're careful, that is). There's no built-in dynamic array in C, you'll just have to write one yourself. In C++, you can use the built-in <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>std::vector</code></a> class. C# and just about every other high-level language also have some similar class that manages dynamic arrays for you.</p>

<p>If you do plan to write your own, here's something to get you started: most dynamic array implementations work by starting off with an array of some (small) default size, then whenever you run out of space when adding a new element, double the size of the array. As you can see in the example below, it's not very difficult at all: (I've omitted safety checks for brevity)</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
  int *array;
  size_t used;
  size_t size;
} Array;

void initArray(Array *a, size_t initialSize) {
  a-&gt;array = (int *)malloc(initialSize * sizeof(int));
  a-&gt;used = 0;
  a-&gt;size = initialSize;
}

void insertArray(Array *a, int element) {
  // a-&gt;used is the number of used entries, because a-&gt;array[a-&gt;used++] updates a-&gt;used only *after* the array has been accessed.
  // Therefore a-&gt;used can go up to a-&gt;size 
  if (a-&gt;used == a-&gt;size) {
    a-&gt;size *= 2;
    a-&gt;array = (int *)realloc(a-&gt;array, a-&gt;size * sizeof(int));
  }
  a-&gt;array[a-&gt;used++] = element;
}

void freeArray(Array *a) {
  free(a-&gt;array);
  a-&gt;array = NULL;
  a-&gt;used = a-&gt;size = 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using it is just as simple:</p>

int i;

initArray(&amp;a, 5);  // initially 5 elements
for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
  insertArray(&amp;a, i);  // automatically resizes as necessary
printf(""%d\n"", a.array[9]);  // print 10th element
printf(""%d\n"", a.used);  // print number of elements

"Converting an int into a 4 byte char array (C)","126084","","<p>Hey, I'm looking to convert a int that is inputed by the user into 4 bytes, that I am assigning to a character array. How can this be done?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Convert a user inputs of 175 to</p>

<p><code>00000000 00000000 00000000 10101111</code></p>

<hr>

<p>Issue with all of the answers so far, converting 255 should result in <code>0 0 0 ff</code> although it prints out as: <code>0 0 0 ffffffff</code></p>

<pre><code>unsigned int value = 255;   

buffer[0] = (value &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF;
buffer[1] = (value &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF;
buffer[2] = (value &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF;
buffer[3] = value &amp; 0xFF;

union {
    unsigned int integer;
    unsigned char byte[4];
} temp32bitint;

temp32bitint.integer = value;
buffer[8] = temp32bitint.byte[3];
buffer[9] = temp32bitint.byte[2];
buffer[10] = temp32bitint.byte[1];
buffer[11] = temp32bitint.byte[0];
</code></pre>

<p>both result in <code>0 0 0 ffffffff</code> instead of <code>0 0 0 ff</code></p>

<p>Just another example is 175 as the input prints out as <code>0, 0, 0, ffffffaf</code> when it should just be <code>0, 0, 0, af</code></p>
","<p>The <em>portable</em> way to do this (ensuring that you get <code>0x00 0x00 0x00 0xaf</code> everywhere) is to use shifts:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char bytes[4];
unsigned long n = 175;

bytes[0] = (n &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF;
bytes[1] = (n &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF;
bytes[2] = (n &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF;
bytes[3] = n &amp; 0xFF;
</code></pre>

<p>The methods using unions and <code>memcpy()</code> will get a different result on different machines.</p>

<hr>

<p>The issue you are having is with the printing rather than the conversion.  I presume you are using <code>char</code> rather than <code>unsigned char</code>, and you are using a line like this to print it:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""%x %x %x %x\n"", bytes[0], bytes[1], bytes[2], bytes[3]);
</code></pre>

<p>When any types narrower than <code>int</code> are passed to <code>printf</code>, they are promoted to <code>int</code> (or <code>unsigned int</code>, if <code>int</code> cannot hold all the values of the original type).  If <code>char</code> is signed on your platform, then <code>0xff</code> likely does not fit into the range of that type, and it is being set to -1 instead (which has the representation <code>0xff</code> on a 2s-complement machine).</p>

<p>-1 is promoted to an <code>int</code>, and has the representation <code>0xffffffff</code> as an <code>int</code> on your machine, and that is what you see.</p>

<p>Your solution is to either actually use <code>unsigned char</code>, or else cast to <code>unsigned char</code> in the <code>printf</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""%x %x %x %x\n"", (unsigned char)bytes[0],
                        (unsigned char)bytes[1],
                        (unsigned char)bytes[2],
                        (unsigned char)bytes[3]);

<p>Method 2:</p>

<pre><code>sprintf(both, ""%s %s"", first, second);

<p>In both cases the content of <code>both</code> would be <code>""First Second""</code>.</p>

<p>I would like to know which one is more efficient (I have to perform several concatenation operations), or if you know a better way to do it.</p>

<pre><code>char * s = malloc(snprintf(NULL, 0, ""%s %s"", first, second) + 1);
sprintf(s, ""%s %s"", first, second);

<p>If your platform supports GNU extensions,  you could also use <code>asprintf()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>char * s = NULL;
asprintf(&amp;s, ""%s %s"", first, second);

<p>If you're stuck with the MS C Runtime, you have to use <code>_scprintf()</code> to determine the length of the resulting string:</p>

<pre><code>char * s = malloc(_scprintf(""%s %s"", first, second) + 1);
sprintf(s, ""%s %s"", first, second);

<p>The following will most likely be the fastest solution:</p>

<pre><code>size_t len1 = strlen(first);
size_t len2 = strlen(second);

char * s = malloc(len1 + len2 + 2);
memcpy(s, first, len1);
s[len1] = ' ';

"How to get the real and total length of char * (char array)?","125406","","<p>For a <code>char []</code>, I can easily get its length by:</p>

<pre><code>char a[] = ""aaaaa"";
int length = sizeof(a)/sizeof(char); // length=6
</code></pre>

<p>However, I cannot do like this to get the length of a <code>char *</code> by:</p>

<pre><code>char *a = new char[10];
int length = sizeof(a)/sizeof(char);
</code></pre>

<p>because, I know, <code>a</code> here is a pointer, such that <code>length</code> here will be always be <code>4</code> (or something other in different systems).</p>

<p>My question is that how can I get the length of a <code>char *</code> afterwards? <em>I know someone may challenge me that you already know its <code>10</code> because you just created it. I want to know this because this step of getting its length may come long long way from its creation and I don't want to come long long way back to check this number. Moreover, I also want to know its real length.</em></p>

<p>To be more specific</p>

<ul>
<li>how can I get its real <code>length=5</code>?</li>
<li>how can I get its total <code>length=10</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>for the following example:</p>

<pre><code>char *a = new char[10]; 
strcpy(a, ""hello"");
</code></pre>
","<p>You can't. Not with 100% accuracy, anyway. The pointer <em>has no length/size but its own</em>. All it does is point to a particular place in memory that holds a char. If that char is part of a string, then you can use <code>strlen</code> to determine what chars follow the one currently being pointed to, but that doesn't mean the <em>array</em> in your case is that big.<br/>
Basically:</p>

<p>A <strong><em>pointer</em></strong> is not an <strong><em>array</em></strong>, so it doesn't <em>need</em> to know what the size of the array is. A pointer can point to a single value, so a pointer can exist without there even being an array. It doesn't even care where the memory it points to is situated (Read only, heap or stack... doesn't matter). A pointer doesn't have a length other than itself. A pointer just is...<br/>
Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>char beep = '\a';
void alert_user(const char *msg, char *signal);//for some reason
alert_user(""Hear my super-awsome noise!"", &amp;beep);//passing pointer to single char!
//
void alert_user(const char *msg, char *signal)
{
    printf(""%s%c\n"", msg, *signal);
}
</code></pre>

<p>A pointer can be a single char aswell as the beginning, end or middle of an array...<Br/>
Think of chars as structs. You sometimes allocate a single struct on the heap. That, too, creates a pointer without an array.</p>

<p>Using only a pointer, to determine how big an array it is pointing to is impossible. The closest you can get to it is using <code>calloc</code> and counting the number of consecutive \0 chars you can find through the pointer. Of course, that doesn't work once you've assigned/reassigned stuff to that array's keys and it also fails if the memory just <em>outside</em> of the array happens to hold <code>\0</code>, too. So using this method is unreliable, dangerous and just generally silly. Don't. Do. It.</p>

<p><em>Another analogy:</em><br/>
Think of a pointer as a road sign, it points to <em>Town X</em>. The sign doesn't know what that town looks like, and it doesn't know or care (or can care) who lives there. It's job is to tell you where to find <em>Town X</em>. It can only tell you how far that town is, but not how big it is. That information is deemed irrelevant for road-signs. That's something that you can only find out by looking at the town itself, not at the road-signs that are pointing you in its direction</p>

<p>So, using a pointer the only thing you can do is:</p>

<pre><code>char a_str[] = ""hello"";//{h,e,l,l,o,\0}
char *arr_ptr = &amp;a_str[0];
printf(""Get length of string -&gt; %d\n"", strlen(arr_ptr));
</code></pre>

<p>But this, of course, only works if the array/string is \0-terminated.</p>

<p>As an asside:</p>

<pre><code>int length = sizeof(a)/sizeof(char);//sizeof char is guaranteed 1, so sizeof(a) is enough
</code></pre>

<p>is actually assigning <code>size_t</code> (the return type of <code>sizeof</code>) to an <code>int</code>, best write:</p>

<pre><code>size_t length = sizeof(a)/sizeof(*a);//best use ptr's type -&gt; good habit
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>size_t</code> is an unsigned type, if <code>sizeof</code> returns bigger values, the value of <code>length</code> might be something you didn't expect...</p>

<p>(In C++, the situation is more complicated since namespaces can be closed and reopened, and scopes other than the current one can be accessed, and names can also have class scope. But that's getting very off-topic.)</p>

<p><em>Automatic</em> variables (pedantically, variables with <em>automatic storage duration</em>) are local variables whose lifetime ends when execution leaves their scope, and are recreated when the scope is reentered.</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) {
    int n = 0;
    printf(""%d "", ++n);  // prints 1 1 1 1 1  - the previous value is lost
}

<p><em>Static</em> variables (pedantically, variables with <em>static storage duration</em>) have a lifetime that lasts until the end of the program. If they are local variables, then their value persists when execution leaves their scope.</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) {
    static int n = 0;
    printf(""%d "", ++n);  // prints 1 2 3 4 5  - the value persists
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>static</code> keyword has various meanings apart from static storage duration. On a global variable or function, it gives it <em>internal linkage</em> so that it's not accessible from other translation units; on a C++ class member, it means there's one instance per class rather than one per object. Also, in C++ the <code>auto</code> keyword no longer means automatic storage duration; it now means automatic type, deduced from the variable's initialiser.</p>

"How does C compute sin() and other math functions?","121927","","<p>I've been poring through .NET disassemblies and the GCC source code, but can't seem to find anywhere the actual implementation of <code>sin()</code> and other math functions... they always seem to be referencing something else.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me find them?  I feel like it's unlikely that ALL hardware that C will run on supports trig functions in hardware, so there must be a software algorithm <em>somewhere</em>, right? </p>

<hr>

<p>I'm aware of several ways that functions <em>can</em> be calculated, and have written my own routines to compute functions using taylor series for fun.  I'm curious about how real, production languages do it, since all of my implementations are always several orders of magnitude slower, even though I think my algorithms are pretty clever (obviously they're not).</p>
","<p>In GNU libm, the implementation of <code>sin</code> is system-dependent. Therefore you can find the implementation, for each platform, somewhere in the appropriate subdirectory of <a href=""http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=tree;f=sysdeps;hb=HEAD"" rel=""noreferrer"">sysdeps</a>.</p>

<p>One directory includes an implementation in C, contributed by IBM. Since October 2011, this is the code that actually runs when you call <code>sin()</code> on a typical x86-64 Linux system. It is apparently faster than the <code>fsin</code> assembly instruction. Source code: <a href=""https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/ieee754/dbl-64/s_sin.c;hb=HEAD#l281"" rel=""noreferrer"">sysdeps/ieee754/dbl-64/s_sin.c</a>, look for <code>__sin (double x)</code>.</p>

<p>This code is very complex. No one software algorithm is as fast as possible and also accurate over the whole range of <em>x</em> values, so the library implements many different algorithms and its first job is to look at <em>x</em> and decide which algorithm to use. In some regions it uses what looks like the familiar Taylor series. Several of the algorithms first compute a quick result, then if that's not accurate enough, discard it and fall back on a slower algorithm.</p>

<p>Older 32-bit versions of GCC/glibc used the <code>fsin</code> instruction, which is surprisingly inaccurate for some inputs. There's a <a href=""http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/"" rel=""noreferrer"">fascinating blog post illustrating this with just 2 lines of code</a>.</p>

<p>fdlibm's implementation of <code>sin</code> in pure C is much simpler than glibc's and is nicely commented.

Your age is 1

<p>instead of what is expected that is:</p>

<pre><code>Hello, please enter your age:
1

","<p>You get this behavior, because <code>int array [ROW][COLUMN] = {1};</code> does <strong><em>not</em></strong> mean ""set all items to one"". Let me try to explain how this works step by step.</p>

<p>The explicit, overly clear way of initializing your array would be like this:</p>

<pre><code>#define ROW 2
#define COLUMN 2

int array [ROW][COLUMN] =
{
  {0, 0},
  {0, 0}

<pre><code>int array [ROW][COLUMN] =
{
  {1, 2}
};
</code></pre>

<p>This means, initialize the first elements to 1 and 2, and the rest of the elements ""as if they had static storage duration"". There is a rule in C saying that all objects of static storage duration, that are not explicitly initialized by the programmer, must be set to zero.</p>

<p>So in the above example, the first row gets set to 1,2 and the next to 0,0 since we didn't give them any explicit values.</p>

<p>Next, there is a rule in C allowing lax brace style. The first example could as well be written as</p>

<pre><code>int array [ROW][COLUMN] = {0, 0, 0, 0};
</code></pre>

<p>although of course this is poor style, it is harder to read and understand. But this rule is convenient, because it allows us to write</p>

<pre><code>int array [ROW][COLUMN] = {0};
</code></pre>

<p>which means: ""initialize the very first column in the first row to 0, and all other items as if they had static storage duration, ie set them to zero.""</p>

<p>therefore, if you attempt</p>

<pre><code>int array [ROW][COLUMN] = {1};

<li>You are increasing <code>code</code> each time you read a character, and you return <code>code</code> back to the caller (even though it is no longer pointing at the first byte of the memory block as it was returned by <code>malloc</code>).</li>
<li>You are casting the result of <code>fgetc(file)</code> to <code>char</code>. You need to check for <code>EOF</code> before casting the result to <code>char</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is important to maintain the original pointer returned by <code>malloc</code> so that you can free it later. If we disregard the file size, we can achieve this still with the following:</p>

<pre><code>char *readFile(char *fileName)
{
    FILE *file = fopen(fileName, ""r"");
    char *code;
    size_t n = 0;
    int c;

    if (file == NULL)
        return NULL; //could not open file

    code = malloc(1000);

    while ((c = fgetc(file)) != EOF)
    {
        code[n++] = (char) c;
    }

    // don't forget to terminate with the null character
    code[n] = '\0';        

    return code;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Daemons work in the background and (usually...) don't belong to a TTY that's why you can't use stdout/stderr in the way you probably want.
Usually a syslog daemon (<em>syslogd</em>) is used for logging messages to files (debug, error,...).</p>

<p>Besides that, there are a few <em>required steps</em> to daemonize a process.</p>

<hr>

<p>If I remember correctly these steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>fork</strong> off the parent process &amp; let it terminate if forking was successful. -> Because the parent process has terminated, the child process now runs in the background.</li>
<li><strong>setsid</strong> - Create a new session. The calling process becomes the leader of the new session and the process group leader of the new process group. The process is now detached from its controlling terminal (CTTY).</li>
<li><strong>Catch signals</strong> - Ignore and/or handle signals.</li>
<li><strong>fork again</strong> &amp; let the parent process terminate to ensure that you get rid of the session leading process. (Only session leaders may get a TTY again.)</li>
<li><strong>chdir</strong> - Change the working directory of the daemon.</li>
<li><strong>umask</strong> - Change the file mode mask according to the needs of the daemon.</li>
<li><strong>close</strong> - Close all open file descriptors that may be inherited from the parent process.</li>
</ul>

"C fopen vs open","118025","","<p>Is there any reason (other than syntactic ones) that you'd want to use </p>

<pre><code>FILE *fdopen(int fd, const char *mode);
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char *mode);
</code></pre>

<p>instead of </p>

<pre><code>int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
</code></pre>

<p>when using C in a Linux environment?</p>
","<p>There are four main reasons to use fopen instead of open.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>fopen</code> provides you with buffering IO that may turn out to be a lot faster than what you're doing with <code>open</code>.</li>
<li><code>fopen</code> does line ending translation if the file is not opened in binary mode, which can be very helpful if your program is ever ported to a non-Unix environment.</li>
<li>A <code>FILE *</code> gives you the ability to use <code>fscanf</code> and other stdio functions.</li>
<li>Your code may someday need to be ported to some other platform that only supports ANSI C and does not support the <code>open</code> function.</li>
</ol>

<p>In my opinion the line ending translation more often gets in your way than helps you, and the parsing of fscanf is so weak that you inevitably end up tossing it out in favor of something more useful.</p>

<p>And most platforms that support C have an <code>open</code> function.</p>

<p>That leaves the buffering question.  In places where you are mainly reading or writing a file sequentially, the buffering support is really helpful and a big speed improvement.  But it can lead to some interesting problems in which data does not end up in the file when you expect it to be there.  You have to remember to <code>fclose</code> or <code>fflush</code> at the appropriate times.</p>

<p>If you're doing seeks, the usefulness of buffering quickly goes down.</p>

<p>Of course, my bias is that I tend to work with sockets a whole lot, and there the fact that you really want to be doing non-blocking IO (which <code>FILE *</code> totally fails to support in any reasonable way) with no buffering at all and often have complex parsing requirements really color my perceptions.</p>

","<p>C does not really have multi-dimensional arrays, but there are several ways to simulate them. The way to pass such arrays to a function depends on the way used to simulate the multiple dimensions:</p>

<p>1) Use an array of arrays. This can only be used if your array bounds are fully determined at compile time, or if your compiler supports <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_array"" rel=""noreferrer"">VLA's</a>:</p>

<pre><code>#define ROWS 4
#define COLS 5

void func(int array[ROWS][COLS])
{
  int i, j;

  for (i=0; i&lt;ROWS; i++)
  {
    for (j=0; j&lt;COLS; j++)
    {
      array[i][j] = i*j;
    }
  }
}

void func_vla(int rows, int cols, int array[rows][cols])
{
  int i, j;

  for (i=0; i&lt;rows; i++)
  {
    for (j=0; j&lt;cols; j++)
    {
      array[i][j] = i*j;
    }
  }
}

int main()
{
  int x[ROWS][COLS];

  func(x);
  func_vla(x, rows, cols);
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) Use a (dynamically allocated) array of pointers to (dynamically allocated) arrays. This is used mostly when the array bounds are not known until runtime.</p>

<pre><code>void func(int** array, int rows, int cols)
{
  int i, j;

  for (i=0; i&lt;rows; i++)
  {
    for (j=0; j&lt;cols; j++)
    {
      array[i][j] = i*j;
    }
  }
}

int main()
{
  int rows, cols, i;
  int **x;

  /* obtain values for rows &amp; cols */

  /* allocate the array */
  x = malloc(rows * sizeof *x);
  for (i=0; i&lt;rows; i++)
  {
    x[i] = malloc(cols * sizeof *x[i]);
  }

  /* use the array */
  func(x, rows, cols);

  /* deallocate the array */
  for (i=0; i&lt;rows; i++)
  {
    free(x[i]);
  }
  free(x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>3) Use a 1-dimensional array and fixup the indices. This can be used with both statically allocated (fixed-size) and dynamically allocated arrays:</p>

<pre><code>void func(int* array, int rows, int cols)
{
  int i, j;

  for (i=0; i&lt;rows; i++)
  {
    for (j=0; j&lt;cols; j++)
    {
      array[i*cols+j]=i*j;
    }
  }
}

int main()
{
  int rows, cols;
  int *x;

  /* obtain values for rows &amp; cols */

  /* allocate the array */
  x = malloc(rows * cols * sizeof *x);

  /* use the array */
  func(x, rows, cols);

  /* deallocate the array */
  free(x);

<p>I used to think that it used to be that:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.h</code> files are header files for C and C++, and usually only contain declarations.</li>
<li><code>.c</code> files are C source code.</li>
<li><code>.cpp</code> files are C++ source code (which can also be C source code).</li>
</ul>

<p>then files like <code>.hpp</code>, <code>.cc</code>, and <code>.cxx</code> came along, and I got totally confused... what's the difference(s) between those? When do you use the ""new"" ones?</p>
","<p>Historically, the first extensions used for C++ were <code>.c</code> and <code>.h</code>, exactly like for C.  This caused practical problems, especially the <code>.c</code> which didn't allow build systems to easily differentiate C++ and C files.</p>

<p>Unix, on which C++ has been developed, has case sensitive file systems.  So some used <code>.C</code> for C++ files.  Other used <code>.c++</code>, <code>.cc</code> and <code>.cxx</code>.  <code>.C</code> and <code>.c++</code> have the problem that they aren't available on other file systems and their use quickly dropped. DOS and Windows C++ compilers tended to use <code>.cpp</code>, and some of them make the choice difficult, if not impossible, to configure.  Portability consideration made that choice the most common, even outside MS-Windows.</p>

<p>Headers have used the corresponding <code>.H</code>, <code>.h++</code>, <code>.hh</code>, <code>.hxx</code> and <code>.hpp</code>. But unlike the main files, <code>.h</code> remains to this day a popular choice for C++ even with the disadvantage that it doesn't allow to know if the header can be included in C context or not. Standard headers now have no extension at all.</p>

<p>Additionally, some are using <code>.ii</code>, <code>.ixx</code>, <code>.ipp</code>, <code>.inl</code> for headers providing inline definitions and <code>.txx</code>, <code>.tpp</code> and <code>.tpl</code> for template definitions.  Those are either included in the headers providing the definition, or manually in the contexts where they are needed.</p>

<p>Compilers and tools usually don't care about what extensions are used, but using an extension that they associate with C++ prevents the need to track out how to configure them so they correctly recognize the language used.</p>

<p>2017 edit: the experimental module support of Visual Studio recognize <code>.ixx</code> as a default extension for module interfaces, clang++ is recognizing <code>.c++m</code>, <code>.cppm</code> and <code>.cxxm</code> for the same purpose.</p>

<p>If I'm running a <code>16-</code>, <code>32-</code> and <code>64-</code> bit machine, then doesn't it mean that the size of an <code>integer</code> is <code>16-</code>, <code>32-</code> and <code>64-</code> bit respectively?</p>

<p>In my machine, I found the <code>WORD_BIT</code> is <code>32</code>. Shouldn't it be <code>64</code> on a <code>64-bit</code> machine? </p>

<pre><code>$ getconf WORD_BIT
32
$ 
</code></pre>

<p>And, shouldn't the <code>sizeof(int)</code> be <code>64-bits</code> (<code>8 bytes</code>) in the above case?</p>
","<p>Doesn't have to be; ""64-bit machine"" can mean many things, but typically means that the CPU has registers that big.  The sizeof a type is determined by the compiler, which doesn't have to have anything to do with the actual hardware (though it typically does); in fact, different compilers on the same machine can have different values for these.</p>

"#pragma pack effect","116942","","<p>I was wondering if someone could explain to me what the <code>#pragma pack</code> preprocessor statement does, and more importantly, why one would want to use it.</p>

<p>I checked out the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2e70t5y1%28VS.80%29.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSDN page</a>, which offered some insight, but I was hoping to hear more from people with experience. I've seen it in code before, though I can't seem to find where anymore.</p>
","<p><code>#pragma pack</code> instructs the compiler to pack structure members with particular alignment.  Most compilers, when you declare a struct, will insert padding between members to ensure that they are aligned to appropriate addresses in memory (usually a multiple of the type's size).  This avoids the performance penalty (or outright error) on some architectures associated with accessing variables that are not aligned properly.  For example, given 4-byte integers and the following struct:</p>

<pre><code>struct Test
{
   char AA;
   int BB;
   char CC;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler could choose to lay the struct out in memory like this:</p>

<pre><code>|   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |  

| AA(1) | pad.................. |
| BB(1) | BB(2) | BB(3) | BB(4) | 
| CC(1) | pad.................. |
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>sizeof(Test)</code> would be 4 &times; 3 = 12, even though it only contains 6 bytes of data.  The most common use case for the <code>#pragma</code> (to my knowledge) is when working with hardware devices where you need to ensure that the compiler does not insert padding into the data and each member follows the previous one.  With <code>#pragma pack(1)</code>, the struct above would be laid out like this:</p>

<pre><code>|   1   |

| AA(1) |
| BB(1) |
| BB(2) |
| BB(3) |
| BB(4) |
| CC(1) |
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>sizeof(Test)</code> would be 1 &times; 6 = 6.</p>

<p>With <code>#pragma pack(2)</code>, the struct above would be laid out like this:</p>

<pre><code>|   1   |   2   | 

| AA(1) | pad.. |
| BB(1) | BB(2) |
| BB(3) | BB(4) |
| CC(1) | pad.. |

"What is the difference between AF_INET and PF_INET in socket programming?","114171","","<p>What is the difference between AF_INET and PF_INET in socket programming?</p>

<p>I'm confused between using AF_INET and PF_INET in <code>socket()</code> and <code>bind()</code>.</p>

<p>Also, how to give ip-address in <code>sin_addr</code> field?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://beej.us/net2/html/syscalls.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Beej's famous network programming guide</a> gives a nice explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In some documentation, you'll see mention of a mystical ""PF_INET"".
  This is a weird etherial beast that is rarely seen in nature, but I
  might as well clarify it a bit here. Once a long time ago, it was
  thought that maybe a address family (what the ""AF"" in ""AF_INET"" stands
  for) might support several protocols that were referenced by their
  protocol family (what the ""PF"" in ""PF_INET"" stands for).<br>
  That didn't happen. Oh well. So the correct thing to do is to use AF_INET in your
  struct sockaddr_in and PF_INET in your call to socket(). But
  practically speaking, you can use AF_INET everywhere. And, since
  that's what W. Richard Stevens does in his book, that's what I'll do
  here.</p>

"fork() and wait() with two child processes","113276","","<p>I need to use the fork() and wait() functions to complete an assignment. We are modelling non-deterministic behaviour and need the program to fork() if there is more than one possible transition.</p>

<p>In order to try and work out how fork and wait work, I have just made a simple program. I think I understand now how the calls work and would be fine if the program only branched once because the parent process could use the exit status from the single child process to determine whether the child process reached the accept state or not.</p>

<p>As you can see from the code that follows though, I want to be able to handle situations where there must be more than one child processes. My problem is that you seem to only be able to set the status using an _exit function once. So, as in my example the exit status that the parent process tests for shows that the first child process issued 0 as it's exit status, but has no information on the second child process.</p>

<p>I tried simply not _exit()-ing on a reject, but then that child process would carry on, and in effect there would seem to be two parent processes.</p>

<p>Sorry for the waffle, but I would be grateful if someone could tell me how my parent process could obtain the status information on more than one child process, or I would be happy for the parent process to only notice accept status's from the child processes, but in that case I would successfully need to exit from the child processes which have a reject status.</p>

","<p>It looks to me as though the basic problem is that you have one <code>wait()</code> call rather than a loop that waits until there are no more children.  You also only wait if the last <code>fork()</code> is successful rather than if at least one <code>fork()</code> is successful.</p>

<p>You should only use <code>_exit()</code> if you don't want normal cleanup operations - such as flushing open file streams including <code>stdout</code>.  There are occasions to use <code>_exit()</code>; this is not one of them.  (In this example, you could also, of course, simply have the children return instead of calling <code>exit()</code> directly because returning from <code>main()</code> is equivalent to exiting with the returned status.  However, most often you would be doing the forking and so on in a function other than <code>main()</code>, and then <code>exit()</code> is often appropriate.)</p>

"Differences between fork and exec","113153","","<p>What are the differences between <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>?</p>
","<p>The use of <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code> exemplifies the spirit of UNIX in that it provides a very simple way to start new processes.</p>

<p>The <code>fork</code> call basically makes a duplicate of the current process, identical in <em>almost</em> every way (not everything is copied over, for example, resource limits in some implementations but the idea is to create as close a copy as possible).</p>

<p>The new process (child) gets a different process ID (PID) and has the PID of the old process (parent) as its parent PID (PPID). Because the two processes are now running exactly the same code, they can tell which is which by the return code of <code>fork</code> - the child gets 0, the parent gets the PID of the child. This is all, of course, assuming the <code>fork</code> call works - if not, no child is created and the parent gets an error code.</p>

<p>The <code>exec</code> call is a way to basically replace the entire current process with a new program. It loads the program into the current process space and runs it from the entry point.</p>

<p>So, <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code> are often used in sequence to get a new program running as a child of a current process. Shells typically do this whenever you try to run a program like <code>find</code> - the shell forks, then the child loads the <code>find</code> program into memory, setting up all command line arguments, standard I/O and so forth.</p>

<p>But they're not required to be used together. It's perfectly acceptable for a program to <code>fork</code> itself without <code>exec</code>ing if, for example, the program contains both parent and child code (you need to be careful what you do, each implementation may have restrictions). This was used quite a lot (and still is) for daemons which simply listen on a TCP port and <code>fork</code> a copy of themselves to process a specific request while the parent goes back to listening.</p>

<p>Similarly, programs that know they're finished and just want to run another program don't need to <code>fork</code>, <code>exec</code> and then <code>wait</code> for the child. They can just load the child directly into their process space.</p>

<p>Some UNIX implementations have an optimized <code>fork</code> which uses what they call copy-on-write. This is a trick to delay the copying of the process space in <code>fork</code> until the program attempts to change something in that space. This is useful for those programs using only <code>fork</code> and not <code>exec</code> in that they don't have to copy an entire process space.</p>

<p>If the <code>exec</code> <em>is</em> called following <code>fork</code> (and this is what happens mostly), that causes a write to the process space and it is then copied for the child process.</p>

<p>Note that there is a whole family of <code>exec</code> calls (<code>execl</code>, <code>execle</code>, <code>execve</code> and so on) but <code>exec</code> in context here means any of them.</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates the typical <code>fork/exec</code> operation where the <code>bash</code> shell is used to list a directory with the <code>ls</code> command:</p>

"Is Fortran easier to optimize than C for heavy calculations?","112635","","<p>From time to time I read that Fortran is or can be faster then C for heavy calculations. Is that really true? I must admit that I hardly know Fortran, but the Fortran code I have seen so far did not show that the language has features that C doesn't have.</p>

<p>If it is true, please tell me why. Please don't tell me what languages or libs are good for number crunching, I don't intend to write an app or lib to do that, I'm just curious.</p>
","<p>The languages have similar feature-sets. The performance difference comes from the fact that Fortran says aliasing is not allowed. Any code that has aliasing is not valid Fortran, but it is up to the programmer and not the compiler to detect these errors. Thus Fortran compilers ignore possible aliasing of memory pointers and allow them to generate more efficient code. Take a look at this little example in C:</p>

<pre><code>void transform (float *output, float const * input, float const * matrix, int *n)
{
    int i;
    for (i=0; i&lt;*n; i++)
    {
        float x = input[i*2+0];
        float y = input[i*2+1];
        output[i*2+0] = matrix[0] * x + matrix[1] * y;
        output[i*2+1] = matrix[2] * x + matrix[3] * y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function would run slower than the Fortran counterpart after optimization. Why so? If you write values into the output array, you may change the values of matrix. After all, the pointers could overlap and point to the same chunk of memory (including the <code>int</code> pointer!). The C compiler is forced to reload the four matrix values from memory for all computations.</p>

<p>In Fortran the compiler can load the matrix values once and store them in registers. It can do so because the Fortran compiler assumes pointers/arrays do not overlap in memory.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the restrict keyword and strict-aliasing have been introduced to the C99 standard to address this problem. It's well supported in most C++ compilers these days as well. The keyword allows you to give the compiler a hint that the programmer promises that a pointer does not alias with any other pointer. The strict-aliasing means that the programmer promises that pointers of different type will never overlap, for example a <code>double*</code> will not overlap with an <code>int*</code> (with the specific exception that <code>char*</code> and <code>void*</code> can overlap with anything).</p>

<p>If you use them you will get the same speed from C and Fortran. However, the ability to use the restrict keyword only with performance critical functions means that C (and C++) programs are much safer and easier to write. For example, consider the invalid Fortran code: <code>CALL TRANSFORM(A(1, 30), A(2, 31), A(3, 32), 30)</code>, which most Fortran compilers will happily compile without any warning but introduces a bug that only shows up on some compilers, on some hardware and with some optimization options.</p>

<p>I suppose that C has a big advantage as it uses long for the calculations and not arbitrary length integers as the other three. Also it doesn't need to load a runtime first (Do the others?).</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>
Do Erlang, Python and Haskell lose speed due to using arbitrary length integers or don't they as long as the values are less than <code>MAXINT</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong>
Why is Haskell so slow? Is there a compiler flag that turns off the brakes or is it my implementation? (The latter is quite probable as Haskell is a book with seven seals to me.)</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong>
Can you offer me some hints how to optimize these implementations without changing the way I determine the factors? Optimization in any way: nicer, faster, more ""native"" to the language.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong>
Do my functional implementations permit LCO (last call optimization, a.k.a tail recursion elimination) and hence avoid adding unnecessary frames onto the call stack?</p>

<p>I really tried to implement the same algorithm as similar as possible in the four languages, although I have to admit that my Haskell and Erlang knowledge is very limited.</p>

<p>In Haskell, using <code>Integer</code> is slower than <code>Int</code> but how much slower depends on the computations performed.  Luckily (for 64 bit machines) <code>Int</code> is sufficient.  For portability sake you should probably rewrite my code to use <code>Int64</code> or <code>Word64</code> (C isn't the only language with a <code>long</code>).</p>

  implementations without changing the way I determine the factors?
  Optimization in any way: nicer, faster, more ""native"" to the language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was what I answered above.   The answer was </p>

<ul>
<li>0) Use optimization via <code>-O2</code> </li>
<li>1) Use fast  (notably: unbox-able) types when possible </li>
<li>2) <code>rem</code> not <code>mod</code> (a frequently forgotten optimization) and </li>

<p>What is better to convert a string to an integer value.</p>

<p>I have tried 2 different methods atoi and sscanf. Both work as expected.</p>

<pre><code>char digits[3] = ""34"";
int device_num = 0;

if(sscanf(digits, ""%d"", &amp;device_num) == EOF) {
    fprintf(stderr, ""WARNING: Incorrect value for device\n"");
    return FALSE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>or using atoi</p>

<pre><code>device_num = atoi(digits);
</code></pre>

<p>I was thinking that the sscanf would be better as you can check for errors. However, atoi doesn't doing any checking.</p>
","<p>You have 3 choices:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>atoi</code></li>
</ol>

<p>This is probably the fastest if you're using it in performance-critical code, but it does no error reporting. If the string does not begin with an integer, it will return 0. If the string contains junk after the integer, it will convert the initial part and ignore the rest. If the number is too big to fit in <code>int</code>, the behaviour is unspecified.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><code>sscanf</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Some error reporting, and you have a lot of flexibility for what type to store (signed/unsigned versions of <code>char/short/int/long/long long/size_t/ptrdiff_t/intmax_t</code>). </p>

<p>The return value is the number of conversions that succeed, so scanning for <code>""%d""</code> will return 0 if the string does not begin with an integer. You can use <code>""%d%n""</code> to store the index of the first character after the integer that's read in another variable, and thereby check to see if the entire string was converted or if there's junk afterwards. However, like <code>atoi</code>, behaviour on integer overflow is unspecified.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><code>strtol</code> and family</li>
</ol>

<p>Robust error reporting, provided you set <code>errno</code> to 0 before making the call. Return values are specified on overflow and <code>errno</code> will be set. You can choose any number base from 2 to 36, or specify 0 as the base to auto-interpret leading <code>0x</code> and <code>0</code> as hex and octal, respectively. Choices of type to convert to are signed/unsigned versions of <code>long/long long/intmax_t</code>. </p>

<p>If you need a smaller type you can always store the result in a temporary <code>long</code> or <code>unsigned long</code> variable and check for overflow yourself. </p>

<p>Since these functions take a pointer to pointer argument, you also get a pointer to the first character following the converted integer, for free, so you can tell if the entire string was an integer or parse subsequent data in the string if needed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Personally, I would recommend the <code>strtol</code> family for <strong>most</strong> purposes. If you're doing something quick-and-dirty, atoi might meet your needs.</p>

<p>As an aside, sometimes I find I need to parse numbers where leading whitespace, sign, etc. are not supposed to be accepted. In this case it's pretty damn easy to roll your own for loop, eg., </p>

<pre><code>for (x=0; (unsigned)*s-'0'&lt;10; s++) 
    x=10*x+(*s-'0');
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can use (for robustness):</p>

<pre><code>if (isdigit(*s))
    x=strtol(s, &amp;s, 10);
else /* error */

<p>I'm checking my output against <a href=""http://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/crc-calculation.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this online CRC calculator</a>.</p>

<p>I've come to the conclusion that either my understanding of how to calculate a CRC16 is wrong, or the online calculator is wrong (the former seems more likely).  Can someone tell me where I might be going wrong?</p>
","<p>There are several details you need to 'match up' with for a particular CRC implementation - even using the same polynomial there can be different results because of minor differences in how data bits are handled, using a particular initial value for the CRC (sometimes it's zero, sometimes 0xffff), and/or inverting the bits of the CRC. For example, sometimes one implementation will work from the low order bits of the data bytes up, while sometimes they'll work from the high order bits down (as yours currently does).</p>

<p>Also, you need to 'push out' the last bits of the CRC after you've run all the data bits through.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that CRC algorithms were designed to be implemented in hardware, so some of how bit ordering is handled may not make so much sense from a software point of view.</p>

<p>If you want to match the CRC16 with polynomial 0x8005 as shown on the lammertbies.nl CRC calculator page, you need to make the following changes to your CRC function:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) run the data bits through the CRC loop starting from the least significant bit instead of from the most significant bit</li>
<li>b) push the last 16 bits of the CRC out of the CRC register after you've finished with the input data</li>
<li>c) reverse the CRC bits (I'm guessing this bit is a carry over from hardware implementations)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, your function might look like:</p>

<pre><code>#define CRC16 0x8005

uint16_t gen_crc16(const uint8_t *data, uint16_t size)
{
    uint16_t out = 0;

        /* Get next bit: */
        out &lt;&lt;= 1;
        out |= (*data &gt;&gt; bits_read) &amp; 1; // item a) work from the least significant bits

        /* Increment bit counter: */
        bits_read++;
        if(bits_read &gt; 7)
        {
            bits_read = 0;
            data++;
            size--;
        }

        /* Cycle check: */
        if(bit_flag)
            out ^= CRC16;

    }

    // item b) ""push out"" the last 16 bits
    int i;

"Try catch statements in C","111096","","<p>I was thinking today about the try/catch blocks existent in another languages. Googled for a while this but with no result. From what I know, there is not such a thing as try/catch in C. However, is there a way to ""simulate"" them?<br>
Sure, there is assert and other tricks but nothing like try/catch, that also catch the raised exception. Thank you</p>
","<p>C itself doesn't support exceptions but you can simulate them to a degree with <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code> calls.</p>

<pre><code>static jmp_buf s_jumpBuffer;

void Example() { 
  if (setjmp(s_jumpBuffer)) {
    // The longjmp was executed and returned control here
    printf(""Exception happened\n"");
  } else {
    // Normal code execution starts here
    Test();
  }
}

void Test() {
  // Rough equivalent of `throw`
  longjump(s_jumpBuffer, 42);

","<p>Define a const static instance of the struct with the initial values and then simply assign this value to your variable whenever you want to reset it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Observations:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are conflicts only between LIBCMT.LIB &amp; MSVCRT.LIB</li>
<li>These two LIB files doesn't exist at the locations shown in the errors.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the problem was because some of the support libraries weren't built with /MD. So, I myself built all the support libraries with /MD and my problem was solved.</p>
","<p>You are mixing code that was compiled with /MD (use DLL version of CRT) with code that was compiled with /MT (use static CRT library).  That cannot work, all source code files must be compiled with the same setting.  Given that you use libraries that were pre-compiled with /MD, almost always the correct setting, you must compile your own code with this setting as well.</p>

<p>Project + Properties, C/C++, Code Generation, Runtime Library.</p>

<p>Beware that these libraries were probably compiled with an earlier version of the CRT, msvcr100.dll is quite new.  Not sure if that will cause trouble, you may have to prevent the linker from generating a manifest.  You must also make sure to deploy the DLLs you need to the target machine, including msvcr100.dll</p>

"print call stack in C or C++","110542","","<p>Is there any way to dump the call stack in a running process in C or C++ every time a certain function is called?  What I have in mind is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>void foo()
{
   print_stack_trace();

   // foo's body

   return
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>print_stack_trace</code> works similarly to <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/caller.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>caller</code></a> in Perl.</p>

<p>Or something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int main (void)
{
    // will print out debug info every time foo() is called
    register_stack_trace_function(foo); 

    // etc...
}
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>register_stack_trace_function</code> puts some sort of internal breakpoint that will cause a stack trace to be printed whenever <code>foo</code> is called.</p>

<p>Does anything like this exist in some standard C library?</p>

<p>I am working on Linux, using GCC.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I have a test run that behaves differently based on some commandline switches that shouldn't affect this behavior.  My code has a pseudo-random number generator that I assume is being called differently based on these switches.  I want to be able to run the test with each set of switches and see if the random number generator is called differently for each one.</p>
","<p>For a linux-only solution you can use <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/backtrace.3.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">backtrace(3)</a> that simply returns an array of <code>void *</code> (in fact each of these point to the return address from the corresponding stack frame). To translate these to something of use, there's <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/3/backtrace_symbols"" rel=""noreferrer"">backtrace_symbols(3)</a>.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/backtrace.3.html#NOTES"" rel=""noreferrer"">notes section in backtrace(3)</a>:</p>

"Simple C example of doing an HTTP POST and consuming the response","110517","","<p>I would like to create a very simple C application that does an HTTP post.  It will take a few parameters, and use these to construct a URL.  I'd just like to do a simple HTTP POST and get the response without the use of curl (the libraries are not and will not be installed on the machine this needs to run).</p>

<p>Pseudo-code:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Process 2 args</p></li>
<li><p>Put args into template URL: <a href=""http://api.somesite.com/apikey=ARG1&amp;command=ARG2"">http://api.somesite.com/apikey=ARG1&amp;command=ARG2</a></p></li>
<li><p>Do POST on generated URL</p></li>
<li><p>Consume response</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My Google and SO searches haven't yielded anything on this matter.</p>
","<p>Sorry it took me so long to do this - I was away for the weekend.</p>

<p>A message has a header part and a message body separated by a blank line.  The blank line is ALWAYS needed even if there is no message body.  The header starts with a command and has additional lines of key value pairs separated by a colon and a space.  If there is a message body, it can be anything you want it to be.</p>

<p>Lines in the header and the blank line at the end of the header must end with a carraige return and linefeed pair (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5757290/http-header-line-break-style"">HTTP header line break style</a>) so that's why those lines have \r\n at the end.</p>

<p>A URL has the form of <code>http://host:port/path?query_string</code></p>

<p>There are two main ways of submitting a request to a website:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>GET: The query string is optional but, if specified, must be reasonably short. Because of this the header could just be the GET command and nothing else. A sample message could be:</p>

<pre><code>GET /path?query_string HTTP/1.0\r\n
\r\n
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>POST: What would normally be in the query string is in the body of the message instead. Because of this the header needs to include the Content-Type: and Content-Length: attributes as well as the POST command.  A sample message could be:</p>

<pre><code>POST /path HTTP/1.0\r\n
Content-Type: text/plain\r\n
Content-Length: 12\r\n
\r\n
query_string
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>So, to answer your question: if the URL you are interested in POSTing to is <a href=""http://api.somesite.com/apikey=ARG1&amp;command=ARG2"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://api.somesite.com/apikey=ARG1&amp;command=ARG2</a> then there is no body or query string and, consequently, no reason to POST because there is nothing to put in the body of the message and so nothing to put in the Content-Type: and Content-Length:</p>

<p>I guess you could POST if you really wanted to.  In that case your message would look like:</p>

<pre><code>POST /apikey=ARG1&amp;command=ARG2 HTTP/1.0\r\n
\r\n
</code></pre>

<p>So to send the message the C program needs to:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a socket</li>
<li>lookup the IP address </li>
<li>open the socket</li>
<li>send the request</li>
<li>wait for the response</li>
<li>close the socket</li>
</ul>

<p>Like the other answer pointed out, 4096 bytes is not a very big response.  I picked that number at random assuming that the response to your request would be short.  If it can be big you have two choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>read the Content-Length: header from the response and then dynamically allocate enough memory to hold the whole response.</li>
<li>write the response to a file as the pieces arrive</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information to answer the question asked in the comments:</p>

<p>What if you want to POST data in the body of the message?  Then you do need to include the Content-Type: and Content-Length: headers.  The Content-Length: is the actual length of everything after the blank line that separates the header from the body.</p>

<p>Here is a sample that takes the following command line arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>host</li>
<li>port</li>
<li>command (GET or POST)</li>
<li>path (not including the query data)</li>
<li>query data (put into the query string for GET and into the body for POST) </li>
<li>list of headers (Content-Length: is automatic if using POST)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, for the original question you would run:</p>

<pre><code>a.out api.somesite.com 80 GET ""/apikey=ARG1&amp;command=ARG2""
</code></pre>

<p>And for the question asked in the comments you would run:</p>

<pre><code>a.out api.somesite.com 80 POST / ""name=ARG1&amp;value=ARG2"" ""Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded""

C doesn't seem to get nearly as much flak and if C++ has all these problems why can't you just restrict yourself to the C subset? What are your thoughts/experience?</p>
","<p>Joel's answer is good for reasons you might <em>have</em> to use C, though there are a few others:</p>

<ul>
<li>You must meet industry guidelines, which are easier to prove and test for in C.</li>
<li>You have tools to work with C, but not C++ (think not just about the compiler, but all the support tools, coverage, analysis, etc)</li>
<li>Your target developers are C gurus</li>
<li>You're writing drivers, kernels, or other low level code</li>
<li>You know the C++ compiler isn't good at optimizing the kind of code you need to write</li>
<li>Your app not only doesn't lend itself to be object oriented, but would be harder to write in that form</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, though, you might <em>want</em> to use C rather than C++:</p>

<ul>
<li>You want the performance of assembler without the trouble of coding in assembler (C++ is, in theory, capable of 'perfect' performance, but the compilers aren't as good at seeing optimizations a good C programmer will see)</li>
<li>The software you're writing is trivial, or nearly so - whip out the tiny C compiler, write a few lines of code, compile and you're all set - no need to open a huge editor with helpers, no need to write practically empty and useless classes, deal with namespaces, etc.  You can do nearly the same thing with a C++ compiler and simply use the C subset, but the C++ compiler is slower, even for tiny programs.</li>
<li>You need extreme performance or small code size, and know the C++ compiler will actually make it harder to accomplish due to the size and performance of the libraries</li>
</ul>

<p>You contend that you could just use the C subset and compile with a C++ compiler, but you'll find that if you do that you'll get slightly different results depending on the compiler.</p>

<p>Regardless, if you're doing that, you're using C.  Is your question really ""Why don't C programmers use C++ compilers?""  If it is, then you either don't understand the language differences, or you don't understand compiler theory.</p>

","<p>The first example doesn't work because you can't assign values to arrays - arrays work (sort of) like const pointers in this respect. What you can do though is copy a new value into the array:</p>

<pre><code>strcpy(p.name, ""Jane"");
</code></pre>

<p>Char arrays are fine to use if you know the maximum size of the string in advance, e.g. in the first example you are 100% sure that the name will fit into 19 characters (not 20 because one character is always needed to store the terminating zero value).</p>

<p>Conversely, pointers are better if you don't know the possible maximum size of your string, and/or you want to optimize your memory usage, e.g. avoid reserving 512 characters for the name ""John"". However, with pointers you need to dynamically allocate the buffer they point to, and free it when not needed anymore, to avoid memory leaks.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> example of dynamically allocated buffers (using the struct definition in your 2nd example):</p>

<pre><code>char* firstName = ""Johnnie"";
char* surname = ""B. Goode"";
person p;

p.name = malloc(strlen(firstName) + 1);
p.surname = malloc(strlen(surname) + 1);

p.age = 25;

<p>In my structure, I have a string also as member which I have to copy to another structure having the same member. How do I do that?</p>
","<p>Copying by plain assignment is best, since it's shorter, easier to read, and has a higher level of abstraction. Instead of saying (to the human reader of the code) ""copy these bits from here to there"", and requiring the reader to think about the size argument to the copy, you're just doing a plain assignment (""copy this value from here to here""). There can be no hesitation about whether or not the size is correct.</p>

<p>Also, if the structure is heavily padded, assignment might make the compiler emit something more efficient, since it doesn't have to copy the padding (and it knows where it is), but <code>mempcy()</code> doesn't so it will always copy the exact number of bytes you tell it to copy.</p>

<p>If your string is an actual array, i.e.:</p>

<p>To get a complete copy. For variable-length data modelled like this though, this is not the most efficient way to do the copy since the entire array will always be copied.</p>

<p>Beware though, that copying structs that contain pointers to heap-allocated memory can be a bit dangerous, since by doing so you're <em>aliasing</em> the pointer, and typically making it ambiguous who owns the pointer after the copying operation.</p>

","<p>.c : c file (where the real action is, in general)</p>

<p>Technically, you could put everything in a single file. A whole C program. million of lines. But we humans tend to organize things. So you create different C files, each one containing particular functions. That's all nice and clean. Then suddenly you realize that a <strong>declaration</strong> you have into a given C file should exist also in another C file. So you would duplicate them. The best is therefore to extract the declaration and put it into a common file, which is the .h</p>

<p>For example, in the cs50.h you find what are called ""forward declarations"" of your functions.
A forward declaration is a quick way to tell the compiler how a function should be called (e.g. what input params) and what it returns, so it can perform proper checking (for example if you call a function with the wrong number of parameters, it will complain).</p>

<p>Another example. Suppose you write a .c file containing a function performing regular expression matching. You want your function to accept the regular expression, the string to match, and a parameter that tells if the comparison has to be case insensitive.</p>

<p>0: if the search is case sensitive</p>

<p>This info goes into the .h, because if any program wants to use these labels, it has no way of knowing them unless you include the info. Of course you can put them in the .c, but then you would have to include the .c code (whole!) which is a waste of time and a source of trouble.</p>

<li><p>Start and stop times are the same. Does it mean that the program hardly takes time to complete execution?</p></li>
<li><p>If 1. is false, then atleast the no.of digits beyond the (.) should differ, which does not happen here. Is my logic correct?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I need to calculate the time taken for execution, and hence the above code.</p>
","<p>Yes, this program has likely used less than a millsecond. Try using microsecond resolution with <code>timeval</code>.</p>

<p>e.g:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;

struct timeval stop, start;
gettimeofday(&amp;start, NULL);
//do stuff
gettimeofday(&amp;stop, NULL);
printf(""took %lu\n"", stop.tv_usec - start.tv_usec);
</code></pre>

<p>You can then query the difference (in microseconds) between <code>stop.tv_usec - start.tv_usec</code>. Note that this will only work for subsecond times (as <code>tv_usec</code> will loop). For the general case use a combination of <code>tv_sec</code> and <code>tv_usec</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2016-08-19</strong></p>

<p>A more appropriate approach on system with <code>clock_gettime</code> support would be:</p>

<pre><code>struct timespec start, end;
clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, &amp;start);
//do stuff
clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, &amp;end);

uint64_t delta_us = (end.tv_sec - start.tv_sec) * 1000000 + (end.tv_nsec - start.tv_nsec) / 1000;

"Parsing JSON using C","104930","","<p>I'm trying to find a good way to parse JSON in C.  I really don't need a huge library or anything, I would rather have something small and lightweight with a bare minimum of features, but good documentation. </p>

"Difference between shared objects (.so), static libraries (.a), and DLL's (.so)?","104147","","<p>I have been involved in some debate with respect to libraries in Linux, and would like to confirm some things.</p>

<p>It is to my understanding (please correct me if I am wrong and I will edit my post later), that there are two ways of using libraries when building an application:</p>

<ol>
<li>Static libraries (.a files): At link time, a copy of the entire library is put into the final application so that the functions within the library are always available to the calling application</li>
<li>Shared objects (.so files): At link time, the object is just verified against its API via the corresponding header (.h) file. The library isn't actually used until run time, where it is needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The obvious advantage of static libraries is that they allow the entire application to be self-contained, while the benefit of dynamic libraries is that the "".so"" file can be replaced (ie: in case it needs to be updated due to a security bug) without requiring the base application to be recompiled.</p>

<p>I have heard some people make a distinction between shared objects and dynamic linked libraries (DLL's), even though they are both "".so"" files. Is there any distinction between shared objects and DLLs when it comes to C/C++ development on Linux or any other POSIX compliant OS (ie: MINIX, UNIX, QNX, etc)? I am told that one key difference (so far) is that shared objects are just used at run time, while DLL's must be opened first using the dlopen() call within the application.</p>

<p>Finally, I have also heard some developers mention ""shared archives"", which, to my understanding, are also static libraries themselves, but are never used by an application directly. Instead, other static libraries will link against the ""shared archives"" to pull some (but not all) functions/resources from the shared archive into the static library being built.</p>

<p>Thank you all in advance for your assistance.</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<hr>

<p>In the context in which these terms were provided to me, I've found out the slight differences in these terms, which may even be just colloquialisms in my industry:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shared Object: A library that is automatically linked into a program when the program starts, and exists as a standalone file. The library is included in the linking list at compile time (ie: LDOPTS+=-lmylib for a library file named mylib.so). <strong>The library must be present at compile time, and when the application starts.</strong></li>
<li>Static Library: A library that is merged into the actual program itself at build time for a single (larger) application containing the application code and the library code that is automatically linked into a program when the program is built, and the final binary containing both the main program and the library itself exists as a single standalone binary file. The library is included in the linking list at compile time (ie: LDOPTS+=-lmylib for a library file named mylib.a). <strong>The library must be present at compile time.</strong></li>
<li>DLL: Essentially the same as a shared object, but rather than being included in the linking list at compile time, the library is loaded via <code>dlopen()</code>/<code>dlsym()</code> commands so that the library does not need to be present at build time for the program to compile. <strong>Also, the library does not need to be present (necessarily) at application startup or compile time</strong>, as it is only needed at the moment the <code>dlopen</code>/<code>dlsym</code> calls are made.</li>
<li>Shared Archive: Essentially the same as a static library, but is compiled with the ""export-shared"" and ""-fPIC"" flags. The library is included in the linking list at compile time (ie: LDOPTS+=-lmylib<code>S</code> for a library file named mylib<code>S</code>.a). The distinction between the two is that this additional flag is required if a shared object or DLL wants to statically link the shared archive into its own code AND be able to make the functions in the shared object available to other programs, rather than just using them internal to the DLL. This is useful in the case when someone provides you with a static library, and you wish to repackage it as an SO. <strong>The library must be present at compile time.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h1>Additional Update</h1>

<p>The distinction between ""<code>DLL</code>"" and ""<code>shared library</code>"" was just a (lazy, inaccurate) colloquialism in the company I worked in at the time (Windows developers being forced to shift to Linux development, and the term stuck), adhering to the descriptions noted above.</p>

<p>Additionally, the trailing ""<code>S</code>"" literal after the library name, in the case of ""shared archives"" was just a convention used at that company, and not in industry in general.</p>
","<p>I've always thought that DLLs and shared objects are just different terms for the same thing - Windows calls them DLLs, while on UNIX systems they're shared objects, with the general term - dynamically linked library - covering both (even the function to open a .so on UNIX is called <code>dlopen()</code> after 'dynamic library').</p>

<p>They are indeed only linked at application startup, however your notion of verification against the header file is incorrect. The header file defines prototypes which are required in order to compile the code which uses the library, but at link time the linker looks inside the library itself to make sure the functions it needs are actually there. The linker has to find the function bodies somewhere at link time or it'll raise an error. It ALSO does that at runtime, because as you rightly point out the library itself might have changed since the program was compiled. This is why ABI stability is so important in platform libraries, as the ABI changing is what breaks existing programs compiled against older versions.</p>

<p>Static libraries are just bundles of object files straight out of the compiler, just like the ones that you are building yourself as part of your project's compilation, so they get pulled in and fed to the linker in exactly the same way, and unused bits are dropped in exactly the same way.</p>

"What's the difference between a null pointer and a void pointer?","104146","","<p>Whats the difference between a <strong>Null pointer</strong> &amp; a <strong>Void pointer</strong>?</p>
","<p><em>Null pointer</em> is a special reserved <strong>value</strong> of a pointer. A pointer of any type has such a reserved value.

"Difference between int32, int, int32_t, int8 and int8_t","103909","","<p>I came across the data type <code>int32_t</code> in a C program recently.  I know that it stores 32 bits, but don't <code>int</code> and <code>int32</code> do the same?</p>

<p>Also, I want to use <code>char</code> in a program.  Can I use <code>int8_t</code> instead? What is the difference?</p>

<p>To summarize: <strong>what is the difference between int32, int, int32_t, int8 and int8_t in C?</strong></p>
","<p>Between <code>int32</code> and <code>int32_t</code>, (and likewise between <code>int8</code> and <code>int8_t</code>) the difference is pretty simple: the C standard defines <code>int8_t</code> and <code>int32_t</code>, but does not define anything named <code>int8</code> or <code>int32</code> -- the latter (if they exist at all) is probably from some other header or library (most likely predates the addition of <code>int8_t</code> and <code>int32_t</code> in C99).</p>

<p>Plain <code>int</code> is quite a bit different from the others. Where <code>int8_t</code> and <code>int32_t</code> each have a specified size, <code>int</code> can be any size >= 16 bits. At different times, both 16 bits and 32 bits have been reasonably common (and for a 64-bit implementation, it should probably be 64 bits).</p>

<p>On the other hand, <code>int</code> is guaranteed to be present in every implementation of C, where <code>int8_t</code> and <code>int32_t</code> are not. It's probably open to question whether this matters to you though. If you use C on small embedded systems and/or older compilers, it may be a problem. If you use it primarily with a modern compiler on desktop/server machines, it probably won't be.</p>

<p>Oops -- missed the part about <code>char</code>. You'd use <code>int8_t</code> instead of char if (and only if) you want an integer type guaranteed to be exactly 8 bits in size. If you want to store characters, you probably want to use <code>char</code> instead. Its size can vary (in terms of number of bits) but it's guaranteed to be exactly one byte. One slight oddity though: there's no guarantee about whether a plain <code>char</code> is signed or unsigned (and many compilers can make it either one, depending on a compile-time flag). If you need to ensure its being either signed or unsigned, you need to specify that explicitly.</p>

","<p>This is really a C question, not specific to Objective-C (which is a superset of the C language). Enums in C are represented as integers. So you need to write a function that returns a string given an enum value. There are many ways to do this. An array of strings such that the enum value can be used as an index into the array or a map structure (e.g. an <code>NSDictionary</code>) that maps an enum value to a string work, but I find that these approaches are not as clear as a function that makes the conversion explicit (and the array approach, although the classic <code>C</code> way is dangerous if your enum values are not continguous from 0). Something like this would work:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString*)formatTypeToString:(FormatType)formatType {
    NSString *result = nil;

<p>Your related question about the correct syntax for an enum value is that you use just the value (e.g. <code>JSON</code>), not the <code>FormatType.JSON</code> sytax. <code>FormatType</code> is a type and the enum values (e.g. <code>JSON</code>, <code>XML</code>, etc.) are values that you can assign to that type.</p>

","<p>In the Old Days (pre-ANSI), predefining symbols such as <code>unix</code> and <code>vax</code> was a way to allow code to detect at compile time what system it was being compiled for. There was no official language standard back then (beyond the reference material at the back of the first edition of K&amp;R), and C code of any complexity was typically a complex maze of <code>#ifdef</code>s to allow for differences between systems. These macro definitions were generally set by the compiler itself, not defined in a library header file. Since there were no real rules about which identifiers could be used by the implementation and which were reserved for programmers, compiler writers felt free to use simple names like <code>unix</code> and assumed that programmers would simply avoid using those names for their own purposes.</p>

<p>The 1989 ANSI C standard introduced rules restricting what symbols an implementation could legally predefine. A macro predefined by the compiler could only have a name starting with two underscores, or with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, leaving programmers free to use identifiers not matching that pattern and not used in the standard library.</p>

<p>As a result, any compiler that predefines <code>unix</code> or <code>linux</code> is non-conforming, since it will fail to compile perfectly legal code that uses something like <code>int linux = 5;</code>.</p>

<p>As it happens, gcc is non-conforming by default -- but it can be made to conform (reasonably well) with the right command-line options:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -std=c90 -pedantic ... # or -std=c89 or -ansi
gcc -std=c99 -pedantic
gcc -std=c11 -pedantic
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.1/gcc/Standards.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the gcc manual</a> for more details.</p>

<p>gcc will be phasing out these definitions in future releases, so you shouldn't write code that depends on them. If your program needs to know whether it's being compiled for a Linux target or not it can check whether <code>__linux__</code> is defined (assuming you're using gcc or a compiler that's compatible with it). See <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/System-specific-Predefined-Macros.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the GNU C preprocessor manual</a> for more information.</p>

<p>A largely irrelevant aside: the ""Best One Liner"" winner of the 1987 <a href=""http://www.ioccc.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">International Obfuscated C Code Contest</a>, by David Korn (yes, the author of the Korn Shell) took advantage of the predefined <code>unix</code> macro:</p>

<pre><code>main() { printf(&amp;unix[""\021%six\012\0""],(unix)[""have""]+""fun""-0x60);}
</code></pre>

<p>It prints <code>""unix""</code>, but for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with the spelling of the macro name.</p>

<p>If you have a variable <code>a</code>, <code>extern int a;</code> is a way to tell the compiler that <code>a</code> is a symbol that might be present in a different translation unit (C compiler speak for source file), don't resolve it until link time.

"How is malloc() implemented internally?","100658","","<p>Can anyone explain how <code>malloc()</code> works internally?</p>

<p>I have sometimes done <code>strace program</code> and I see a lot of <code>sbrk</code> system calls, doing <code>man sbrk</code> talks about it being used in <code>malloc()</code> but not much more.</p>
","<p>The <code>sbrk</code>system call moves the ""border"" of the data segment. This means it moves a border of an area in which a program may read/write data (letting it grow or shrink, although AFAIK no <code>malloc</code> really gives memory segments back to the kernel with that method). Aside from that, there's also <code>mmap</code> which is used to map files into memory but is also used to allocate memory (if you need to allocate shared memory, <code>mmap</code> is how you do it).</p>

<p>So you have two methods of getting more memory from the kernel: <code>sbrk</code> and <code>mmap</code>. There are various strategies on how to organize the memory that you've got from the kernel.</p>

<p>One naive way is to partition it into zones, often called ""buckets"", which are dedicated to certain structure sizes. For example, a <code>malloc</code> implementation could create buckets for 16, 64, 256 and 1024 byte structures. If you ask <code>malloc</code> to give you memory of a given size it rounds that number up to the next bucket size and then gives you an element from that bucket. If you need a bigger area <code>malloc</code> could use <code>mmap</code> to allocate directly with the kernel. If the bucket of a certain size is empty <code>malloc</code> could use <code>sbrk</code> to get more space for a new bucket.</p>

<p>There are various <code>malloc</code> designs and there is propably no one true way of implementing <code>malloc</code> as you need to make a compromise between speed, overhead and avoiding fragmentation/space effectiveness. For example, if a bucket runs out of elements an implementation might get an element from a bigger bucket, split it up and add it to the bucket that ran out of elements. This would be quite space efficient but would not be possible with every design. If you just get another bucket via <code>sbrk</code>/<code>mmap</code> that might be faster and even easier, but not as space efficient. Also, the design must of course take into account that ""free"" needs to make space available to <code>malloc</code> again somehow. You don't just hand out memory without reusing it.</p>

<p>If you're interested, the OpenSER/Kamailio SIP proxy has two <code>malloc</code> implementations (they need their own because they make heavy use of shared memory and the system <code>malloc</code> doesn't support shared memory). See: <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/tree/master/mem"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/tree/master/mem</a></p>

<p>Then you could also have a look at the <a href=""http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=tree;f=malloc"" rel=""noreferrer"">GNU libc <code>malloc</code> implementation</a>, but that one is very complicated, IIRC.</p>

<p>Use the GDB TUI mode. My copy of GDB enables it when I type the minus and Enter. Then type C-x 2 (that is hold down Control and press X, release both and then press 2). That will put it into split source and disassembly display. Then use <code>stepi</code> and <code>nexti</code> to move one machine instruction at a time. Use C-x o to switch between the TUI windows.</p>

<p>To your second question:
If your string is not terminated with<code>\0</code>, it might still print the expected output because following your string is a non-printable character in your memory.

","<p>Working for about 4-5 years with software/firmware development and environment testing of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniaturized_satellite"">miniaturized satellites</a>*, I would like to share my experience here.</p>

<p>*(<em>miniaturized satellites are a lot more prone to single event upsets than bigger satellites due to its relatively small, limited sizes for its electronic components</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be very concise and direct: there is no mechanism to recover from <em>detectable, erroneous
  situation</em> by the software/firmware itself <em>without</em>, at least, one
  <em>copy</em> of <em>minimum working version</em> of the software/firmware <em>somewhere</em> for <em>recovery</em> purpose - and with the <em>hardware supporting the recovery</em> (functional).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, this situation is normally handled both in the hardware and software level. Here, as you request, I will share what we can do in the software level.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>...recovery purpose...</strong>. Provide ability to update/recompile/reflash your software/firmware in real environment. This is an <em>almost must-have</em> feature for any software/firmware in highly ionized environment. Without this, you <em>could</em> have redundant software/hardware as many as you want but at one point, they are all going to blow up. So, prepare this feature!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>...minimum working version...</strong> Have responsive, multiple copies, minimum version of the software/firmware in your code. This is like Safe mode in Windows. Instead of having only one, fully functional version of your software, have multiple copies of the minimum version of your software/firmware. The minimum copy will usually having much less size than the full copy and almost always have <em>only</em> the following two or three features: </p>

<ol>
<li>capable of listening to command from external system, </li>
<li>capable of updating the current software/firmware, </li>
<li>capable of monitoring the basic operation's housekeeping data.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>...copy... somewhere...</strong> Have redundant software/firmware somewhere. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You could, with <em>or</em> without redundant hardware, try to have redundant software/firmware in your ARM uC. This is normally done by having two or more identical software/firmware <em>in separate addresses</em> which sending heartbeat to each other - but only one will be active at a time. If one or more software/firmware is known to be unresponsive, switch to the other software/firmware. The benefit of using this approach is we can have functional replacement immediately after an error occurs - without any contact with whatever external system/party who is responsible to detect and to repair the error (in satellite case, it is usually the Mission Control Centre (MCC)). </p>

<p>Strictly speaking, without redundant hardware, the disadvantage of doing this is you actually <em>cannot</em> eliminate <em>all</em> single point of failures. At the very least, you will still have <em>one</em> single point of failure, which is <em>the switch itself</em> (or often the beginning of the code). Nevertheless, for a device limited by size in a highly ionized environment (such as pico/femto satellites), the reduction of the single point of failures to one point <em>without</em> additional hardware will still be worth considering. Somemore, the piece of code for the switching would certainly be much less than the code for the whole program - significantly reducing the risk of getting Single Event in it.</p></li>
<li><p>But if you are not doing this, you should have at least one copy in your external system which can come in contact with the device and update the software/firmware (in the satellite case, it is again the mission control centre). </p></li>
<li>You could also have the copy in your permanent memory storage in your device which can be triggered to restore the running system's software/firmware</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>...detectable erroneous situation..</strong> The error must be <em>detectable</em>, usually by the hardware <em>error correction/detection circuit</em> or by a small piece of code for error correction/detection. It is best to put such code small, multiple, and <em>independent</em> from the main software/firmware. Its main task is <em>only</em> for checking/correcting. If the hardware circuit/firmware is <em>reliable</em> (such as it is more radiation hardened than the rests - or having multiple circuits/logics), then you might consider making error-correction with it. But if it is not, it is better to make it as error-detection. The correction can be by external system/device. For the error correction, you could consider making use of a basic error correction algorithm like Hamming/Golay23, because they can be implemented more easily both in the circuit/software. But it ultimately depends on your team's capability. For error detection, normally CRC is used.</p></li>

<p>for example I want to do some stuff, then wait say 1 minute, then continue on doing stuff.</p>

<p>Did that make sense? Can anyone help me out?</p>

<p>In order to clarify, this is the <em>only</em> way I'm aware of to do this with ISO C99 (and the question is tagged with nothing more than ""C"" which usually means portable solutions are desirable although, of course, vendor-specific solutions may still be given).</p>

<p>By all means, if you're on a platform that provides a more efficient way, <em>use it.</em> As several comments have indicated, there may be specific problems with a tight loop like this, with regard to CPU usage and battery life.</p>

<p>Any decent time-slicing OS would be able to drop the dynamic priority of a task that continuously uses its full time slice but the battery power may be more problematic.</p>

<p>However C specifies <em>nothing</em> about the OS details in a hosted environment, and this answer is for ISO C and ISO C alone (so no use of <code>sleep</code>, <code>select</code>, Win32 API calls or anything like that).</p>

","<p>You have compiled your code with references to the correct math.h header file, but when you attempted to link it, you forgot the option to include the math library.  As a result, you can compile your .o object files, but not build your executable.</p>

<p>As Paul has already mentioned add ""<code>-lm</code>"" to link with the math library in the step where you are attempting to generate your executable.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5005363/undefined-reference-to-sin#comment22017935_5005419"">comment</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/1853263/linuxd"">linuxD</a> asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why for <code>sin()</code> in <code>&lt;math.h&gt;</code>, do we need <code>-lm</code> option explicitly; but,
  not for <code>printf()</code> in <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because both these functions are implemented as part of the ""Single UNIX Specification"".  This history of this standard is interesting, and is known by many names (IEEE Std 1003.1, X/Open Portability Guide, POSIX, Spec 1170).  </p>

<p>This standard, <a href=""http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/vol3_ps.ps"" rel=""noreferrer"">specifically separates out the ""Standard C library"" routines from the ""Standard C Mathematical Library"" routines (page 277)</a>.  The pertinent passage is copied below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Standard C Library </p>
  
  <p>The Standard C library is automatically searched by
  <code>cc</code> to resolve external references. This library supports all of the
  interfaces of the Base System, as defined in Volume 1, except for the
  Math Routines. </p>
  
  <p>Standard C Mathematical Library </p>
  
  <p>This library supports
  the Base System math routines, as defined in Volume 1. The <code>cc</code> option
  <code>-lm</code> is used to search this library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasoning behind this separation was influenced by a number of factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_wars"" rel=""noreferrer"">UNIX wars</a> led to increasing divergence from the original AT&amp;T UNIX offering.</li>
<li>The number of UNIX platforms added difficulty in developing software for the operating system.</li>
<li>An attempt to define the lowest common denominator for software developers was launched, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX"" rel=""noreferrer"">called 1988 POSIX</a>.</li>
<li>Software developers programmed against the POSIX standard to provide their software on ""POSIX compliant systems"" in order to reach more platforms.</li>
<li>UNIX customers demanded ""POSIX compliant"" UNIX systems to run the software.</li>
</ol>

<p>The pressures that fed into the decision to put <code>-lm</code> in a different library probably included, but are not limited to:</p>

<ol>
<li>It seems like a good way to keep the size of libc down, as many applications don't use functions embedded in the math library.</li>
<li>It provides flexibility in math library implementation, where some math libraries rely on larger embedded lookup tables while others may rely on smaller lookup tables (computing solutions).</li>
<li>For truly size constrained applications, it permits reimplementations of the math library in a non-standard way (like pulling out just <code>sin()</code> and putting it in a custom built library.</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case, it is now part of the standard to not be automatically included as part of the C language, and that's why you must add <code>-lm</code>.</p>

<p>In practice, they tend to just have some nonsensical value in there initially - some compilers may even put in specific, fixed values to make it obvious when looking in a debugger - but strictly speaking, the compiler is free to do anything from crashing to summoning <a href=""http://catb.org/jargon/html/N/nasal-demons.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">demons through your nasal passages</a>.</p>

<p>As for why it's undefined behavior instead of simply ""undefined/arbitrary value"", there are a number of CPU architectures that have additional flag bits in their representation for various types.

<p>Attempting to work with a value with these flag bits set can result in a CPU exception in an operation that <em>really</em> shouldn't fail (eg, integer addition, or assigning to another variable). And if you go and leave a variable uninitialized, the compiler might pick up some random garbage with these flag bits set - meaning touching that uninitialized variable may be deadly.</p>

"How do you implement a class in C?","95567","","<p>Assuming I have to use C (no C++ or object oriented compilers) and I don't have dynamic memory allocation, what are some techniques I can use to implement a class, or a good approximation of a class? Is it always a good idea to isolate the ""class"" to a separate file? Assume that we can preallocate the memory by assuming a fixed number of instances, or even defining the reference to each object as a constant before compile time. Feel free to make assumptions about which OOP concept I will need to implement (it will vary) and suggest the best method for each.</p>

<p>Restrictions:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have to use C and not an OOP
because I'm writing code for an
embedded system, and the compiler and
preexisting code base is in C. </li>
<li>There is no dynamic memory allocation
because we don't have enough memory
to reasonably assume we won't run out
if we start dynamically allocating
it.</li>
<li>The compilers we work with have no problems with function pointers</li>
</ul>
","<p>That depends on the exact ""object-oriented"" feature-set you want to have. If you need stuff like overloading and/or virtual methods, you probably need to include function pointers in structures:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
  float (*computeArea)(const ShapeClass *shape);
} ShapeClass;

float shape_computeArea(const ShapeClass *shape)
{
  return shape-&gt;computeArea(shape);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would let you implement a class, by ""inheriting"" the base class, and implementing a suitable function:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
  ShapeClass shape;
  float width, height;
} RectangleClass;

static float rectangle_computeArea(const ShapeClass *shape)
{
  const RectangleClass *rect = (const RectangleClass *) shape;
  return rect-&gt;width * rect-&gt;height;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This of course requires you to also implement a constructor, that makes sure the function pointer is properly set up. Normally you'd dynamically allocate memory for the instance, but you can let the caller do that, too:</p>

<pre><code>void rectangle_new(RectangleClass *rect)
{
  rect-&gt;width = rect-&gt;height = 0.f;
  rect-&gt;shape.computeArea = rectangle_computeArea;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want several different constructors, you will have to ""decorate"" the function names, you can't have more than one <code>rectangle_new()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>void rectangle_new_with_lengths(RectangleClass *rect, float width, float height)
{
  rectangle_new(rect);
  rect-&gt;width = width;
  rect-&gt;height = height;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a basic example showing usage:</p>

<pre><code>int main(void)
{
  RectangleClass r1;

  rectangle_new_with_lengths(&amp;r1, 4.f, 5.f);
  printf(""rectangle r1's area is %f units square\n"", shape_computeArea(&amp;r1));
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this gives you some ideas, at least. For a successful and rich object-oriented framework in C, look into glib's <a href=""http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/stable/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GObject</a> library.</p>

<p>Also note that there's no explicit ""class"" being modelled above, each object has its own method pointers which is a bit more flexible than you'd typically find in C++. Also, it costs memory. You could get away from that by stuffing the method pointers in a <code>class</code> structure, and invent a way for each object instance to reference a class.</p>

<p>How can I see an the output of my C programs using Dev-C++? I found a C++ specific solution, <code>System(""pause"")</code>, and a really ugly C solution, <code>while</code> looping <code>fflush(stdout)</code>, but nothing nice and pretty.</p>
","<p>In Windows when a process terminates, the OS closes the associated window.  This happens with all programs (and is generally desirable behaviour), but people never cease to be surprised when it happens to the ones they write themselves.</p>

<p>I am being slightly harsh perhaps; many IDE's execute the user's process in a shell as a child process, so that it does not own the window so it won't close when the process terminates.  Although this would be trivial, Dev-C++ does not do that.</p>

<p>Be aware that when Dev-C++ was popular, this question appeard at least twice a day on Dev-C++'s own forum on Sourceforge.  For that reason the forum has a ""Read First"" thread that provides a suggested solution amongst solutions to many other common problems.

<p>Note that Dev-C++ is somewhat old and no longer actively maintained.  It suffers most significantly from an almost unusable and very limited debugger integration.  Traffic on the Dev-C++ forum has been dropping off since the release of VC++ 2005 Express, and is now down to a two or three posts a week rather than the 10 or so a day it had in 2005.

","<p>Since you're on an embedded platform, it's quite possible that you don't have the full range of capabilities from the <code>printf()</code>-style functions.</p>

<p>Assuming you have floats at all (still not necessarily a given for embedded stuff), you can emulate it with something like:</p>

<pre><code>char str[100];
float adc_read = 678.0123;

char *tmpSign = (adc_read &lt; 0) ? ""-"" : """";

sprintf (str, ""adc_read = %s%d.%04d\n"", tmpSign, tmpInt1, tmpInt2);

<p>You'll need to restrict how many characters come after the decimal based on the sizes of your integers. For example, with a 16-bit signed integer, you're limited to four digits (9,999 is the largest power-of-ten-minus-one that can be represented).</p>

<p>However, there are ways to handle this by further processing the fractional part, shifting it by four decimal digits each time (and using/subtracting the integer part) until you have the precision you desire.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>One final point you mentioned that you were using <code>avr-gcc</code> in a response to one of the other answers.

<p>As I originally suspected, you need to do some extra legwork to get floating point support. This is because embedded stuff rarely needs floating point (at least none of the stuff I've ever done). It involves setting extra parameters in your makefile and linking with extra libraries.</p>

<p>However, that's likely to increase your code size quite a bit due to the need to handle general output formats. If you can restrict your float outputs to 4 decimal places or less, I'd suggest turning my code into a function and just using that - it's likely to take up far less room.</p>

<p>In case that link ever disappears, what you have to do is ensure that your gcc command has <code>""-Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_flt -lm</code>"". This translates to:</p>

<ul>
<li>force vfprintf to be initially undefined (so that the linker has to resolve it).</li>

","<p>It is common for comparison functions to return <code>0</code> on ""equals"", so that they can also return a negative number for ""less than"" and a positive number for ""greater than"".  <code>strcmp()</code> and <code>memcmp()</code> work like this.</p>

So it might be that the return values chosen for this function are fine, but it is the function's <em>name</em> that is in error (it should really just be called <code>compare()</code> or similar).</p>

"When to use malloc for char pointers","94620","","<p>I'm specifically focused on when to use malloc on char pointers</p>

<pre><code>char *ptr;
ptr = ""something"";
...code...
...code...
ptr = ""something else"";
</code></pre>

<p>Would a malloc be in order for something as trivial as this? If yes, why? If not, then when is it necessary for char pointers?</p>
","<p>As was indicated by others, you don't need to use malloc just to do:</p>

<pre><code>const char *foo = ""bar"";
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for that is exactly that <code>*foo</code> <em>is</em> a pointer &mdash; when you initialize <code>foo</code> you're not creating a copy of the string, just a pointer to where <code>""bar""</code> lives in the data section of your executable.  You can copy that pointer as often as you'd like, but remember, they're always pointing back to the same single instance of that string.</p>

<p>So when should you use malloc?  Normally you use <code>strdup()</code> to copy a string, which handles the malloc in the background.  e.g.</p>

<pre><code>const char *foo = ""bar"";
char *bar = strdup(foo); /* now contains a new copy of ""bar"" */
printf(""%s\n"", bar);     /* prints ""bar"" */
free(bar);               /* frees memory created by strdup */
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we finally get around to a case where you may want to malloc if you're using <code>sprintf()</code> or, more safely <code>snprintf()</code> which creates / formats a new string.</p>

<pre><code>char *foo = malloc(sizeof(char) * 1024);        /* buffer for 1024 chars */
snprintf(foo, 1024, ""%s - %s\n"", ""foo"", ""bar""); /* puts ""foo - bar\n"" in foo */
printf(foo);                                    /* prints ""foo - bar"" */
free(foo);                                      /* frees mem from malloc */

And if you didn't know what kind of file descriptor you had, you'd have to set both to be sure.  But in addition, a non-blocking read with no data available was also indicated inconsistently; depending on the OS and the type of file descriptor the read may return 0, or -1 with errno EAGAIN, or -1 with errno EWOULDBLOCK.  Even today, setting <code>FIONBIO</code> or <code>O_NDELAY</code> on Solaris causes a read with no data to return 0 on a tty or pipe, or -1 with errno EAGAIN on a socket.  However 0 is ambiguous since it is also returned for EOF.</p>

<p>POSIX addressed this with the introduction of <code>O_NONBLOCK</code>, which has standardized behavior across different systems and file descriptor types.  Because existing systems usually want to avoid any changes to behavior which might break backward compatibility, POSIX defined a new flag rather than mandating specific behavior for one of the others.  Some systems like Linux treat all 3 the same, and also define EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK to the same value, but systems wishing to maintain some other legacy behavior for backward compatibility can do so when the older mechanisms are used.</p>

<p>New programs should use <code>fcntl(</code>...<code>O_NONBLOCK</code>...<code>)</code>, as standardized by POSIX.</p>

"Why is the use of alloca() not considered good practice?","92305","","<p><code>alloca()</code> allocates memory from Stack rather than heap which is case in <code>malloc()</code>. So, when I return from the routine the memory is freed. So, actually this solves my problem of freeing up of dynamically allocated memory. Freeing of memory allocated through <code>malloc()</code> is a major headache and if somehow missed leads to all sorts memory problems.</p>

<p>Why is the use of <code>alloca()</code> discouraged in spite of the above features?</p>
","<p>The answer is right there in the <code>man</code> page (at least on Linux):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RETURN VALUE
         The alloca() function returns a pointer to the beginning of the
  allocated  space.   If  the 
  allocation  causes
         stack overflow, program behaviour is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which isn't to say it should never be used.  One of the OSS projects I work on uses it extensively, and as long as you're not abusing it (<code>alloca</code>'ing huge values), it's fine.  Once you go past the ""few hundred bytes"" mark, it's time to use <code>malloc</code> and friends, instead.  You may still get allocation failures, but at least you'll have some indication of the failure instead of just blowing out the stack.</p>

","<p>In Visual Studio the default stack size is 1 MB i think, so with a recursion depth of 10,000 each stack frame can be at most ~100 bytes which should be sufficient for a DFS algorithm.</p>

<p>Most compilers including Visual Studio let you specify the stack size. On some (all?) linux flavours the stack size isn't part of the executable but an environment variable in the OS.

<p>I would like to know the most robust / fastest way of checking to see if stdin exists (data is being piped to the program) and if so reading that data in.  If it doesn't exist, the processing will take place on the filename given.  I have tried using the following the test for size of <code>stdin</code> but I believe since it's a stream and not an actual file, it's not working as I suspected it would and it's always printing <code>-1</code>.  I know I could always read the input 1 character at a time while != EOF but I would like a more generic solution so I could end up with either a fd or a FILE* if stdin exists so the rest of the program will function seamlessly.  I would also like to be able to know its size, pending the stream has been closed by the previous program.</p>

","<p>First, ask the program to tell you what is wrong by checking the <code>errno</code>, which is set on failure, such as during <code>fseek</code> or <code>ftell</code>.</p>

<p>Others (tonio &amp; LatinSuD) have explained the mistake with handling stdin versus checking for a filename. Namely, first check <code>argc</code> (argument count) to see if there are any command line parameters specified <code>if (argc &gt; 1)</code>, treating <code>-</code> as a special case meaning <code>stdin</code>. </p>

<p>If no parameters are specified, then assume input is (going) to come from <code>stdin</code>, which is a <strong>stream</strong> not file, and the <code>fseek</code> function fails on it.</p>

<p>In the case of a stream, where you cannot use file-on-disk oriented library functions (i.e. <code>fseek</code> and <code>ftell</code>), you simply have to count the number of bytes read (including trailing newline characters) until receiving <strong>EOF</strong> (end-of-file).</p>

<p>For usage with large files you could speed it up by using <code>fgets</code> to a char array for more efficient reading of the bytes in a (text) file. For a binary file you need to use <code>fopen(const char* filename, ""rb"")</code> and use <code>fread</code> instead of <code>fgetc/fgets</code>.</p>

<p>You could also check the for <code>feof(stdin)</code> / <code>ferror(stdin)</code> when using the byte-counting method to detect any errors when reading from a stream.</p>

<p>I need to know how to call gcc (/g++) to make it create a DLL, but also how to write (/generate) an exports file... and what I can/cannot do in a DLL (like, can I take arguments by pointer/reference from the VB front-end? Can the DLL call a theoretical function in the front-end? Or have a function take a ""function pointer"" (I don't even know if that's possible) from VB and call it?) I'm fairly certain I can't pass a variant to the DLL...but that's all I know really.</p>

<h2>update again</h2>

<p>Okay, I figured out how to compile it with gcc, to make the dll I ran</p>

<pre><code>gcc -c -DBUILD_DLL dll.c
gcc -shared -o mydll.dll dll.o -Wl,--out-implib,libmessage.a
</code></pre>

<p>and then I had another program load it and test the functions, and it worked great,
thanks so much for the advice,
but I tried loading it with VB6, like this</p>

<pre><code>Public Declare Function add2 Lib ""C:\c\dll\mydll.dll"" (num As Integer) As Integer
</code></pre>

<p>then I just called add2(text1.text) from a form, but it gave me a runtime error:</p>

<p>""Can't find DLL entry point add2 in C:\c\dll\mydll.dll""</p>

<p>this is the code I compiled for the DLL:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef BUILD_DLL
#define EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
#else
#define EXPORT __declspec(dllimport)
#endif

EXPORT int __stdcall add2(int num){
  return num + 2;
}

EXPORT int __stdcall mul(int num1, int num2){
  return num1 * num2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>calling it from the C program like this worked, though:</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;windows.h&gt;

int main(){

  HANDLE ldll;
  int (*add2)(int);
  int (*mul)(int,int);

  ldll = LoadLibrary(""mydll.dll"");
  if(ldll&gt;(void*)HINSTANCE_ERROR){
    add2 = GetProcAddress(ldll, ""add2"");
    mul = GetProcAddress(ldll, ""mul"");
    printf(""add2(3): %d\nmul(4,5): %d"", add2(3), mul(4,5));
  } else {
    printf(""ERROR."");
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>any ideas?</p>

<h2>solved it</h2>

<p>To solve the previous problem, I just had to compile it like so:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -c -DBUILD_DLL dll.c
gcc -shared -o mydll.dll dll.o -Wl,--add-stdcall-alias
</code></pre>

<p>and use this API call in VB6</p>

<pre><code>Public Declare Function add2 Lib ""C:\c\dll\mydll"" _
    (ByVal num As Integer) As Integer
</code></pre>

<p>I learned not to forget to specify ByVal or ByRef explicitly--I was just getting back the address of the argument I passed, it looked like, -3048.</p>
","<p>Regarding building a DLL using MinGW, here are some very brief instructions.</p>

<p>First, you need to mark your functions for export, so they can be used by callers of the DLL. To do this, modify them so they look like (for example)</p>

<pre><code>__declspec( dllexport ) int add2(int num){
   return num + 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then, assuming your functions are in a file called funcs.c, you can compile them:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -shared -o mylib.dll funcs.c
</code></pre>

<p>The -shared flag tells gcc to create a DLL.</p>

<p>To check if the DLL has actually exported the functions, get hold of the free <a href=""http://www.dependencywalker.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dependency Walker</a> tool and use it to examine the DLL.</p>

<p>For a free IDE which will automate all the flags etc. needed to build DLLs, take a look at the excellent <a href=""http://www.codeblocks.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Code::Blocks</a>, which works very well with MinGW.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For more details on this subject, see the article <a href=""http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_DLL"" rel=""noreferrer"">Creating a MinGW DLL for Use with Visual Basic</a> on the MinGW Wiki.</p>

<p>You cannot usually get old revisions of a standard (any standard) directly from the standards bodies shortly after a new edition of the standard is released.  Thus, standards for C89, C90, C99, C++98, C++03 will be hard to find for purchase from a standards body.  If you need an old revision of a standard, check <a href=""http://www.techstreet.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Techstreet</a> as one possible source.  For example, it can still provide the Canadian version CAN/CSA-ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard in PDF, for a fee.</p>

<h3>Print versions of the standard</h3>

<p>Print copies of the standards are available from national standards bodies and <a href=""http://www.iso.ch/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ISO</a> but are very expensive.</p>

<p>If you want a hardcopy of the C90 standard for much less money than above, you may be able to find a cheap used copy of <a href=""http://jargonwiki.com/wiki/Bullschildt"" rel=""noreferrer"">Herb Schildt</a>'s book <a href=""http://www.davros.org/c/schildt.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>The Annotated ANSI Standard</em></a> at <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0078819520"" rel=""noreferrer"">Amazon</a>, which contains the actual text of the standard (useful) and commentary on the standard (less useful).</p>

</ul>

<p>Note that these documents are not the same as the standard, though the versions just prior to the meetings that decide on a standard are usually very close to what is in the final standard.  The FCD (Final Committee Draft) versions are password protected; you need to be on the standards committee to get them.</p>

<p>However, in my opinion, even though the draft versions might be very close to the final ratified versions of the standards, you should really get a copy of the actual documents — especially if you're planning on quoting them as references.  Of course, starving students should go ahead and use the drafts if strapped for cash.</p>

<hr>

<p>It appears that, if you are willing and able to wait a few months after ratification of a standard, to search for ""INCITS/ISO/IEC"" instead of ""ISO/IEC"" when looking for a standard is the key. This way I was able to find the C++11 standard at reasonable price and now the C11 standard.

"What does void* mean and how to use it?","91234","","<p>Today when I was reading others' code, I saw something like <code>void *func(void* i);</code>, what does this <code>void*</code> mean here for the function name and for the variable type, respectively? </p>

<p>In addition, when do we need to use this kind of pointer and how to use it? </p>
","<p>A pointer to <code>void</code> is a ""generic"" pointer type.  A <code>void *</code> can be converted to any other pointer type without an explicit cast.  You cannot dereference a <code>void *</code> or do pointer arithmetic with it; you must convert it to a pointer to an complete data type first.</p>

<p>It gets used in places where you need to be able to work with different pointer types in the same code.  One commonly cited example is the library function <code>qsort</code>:</p>

<pre><code>void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size, 
           int (*compar)(const void *, const void *));
</code></pre>

<p><code>base</code> is the address of an array, <code>nmemb</code> is the number of elements in the array, <code>size</code> is the size of each element, and <code>compar</code> is a pointer to a function that compares two elements of the array.  It gets called like so:</p>

<pre><code>int iArr[10];
double dArr[30];
long lArr[50];
...
qsort(iArr, sizeof iArr/sizeof iArr[0], sizeof iArr[0], compareInt);
qsort(dArr, sizeof dArr/sizeof dArr[0], sizeof dArr[0], compareDouble);
qsort(lArr, sizeof lArr/sizeof lArr[0], sizeof lArr[0], compareLong);
</code></pre>

<p>The array expressions <code>iArr</code>, <code>dArr</code>, and <code>lArr</code> are implicitly converted from array types to pointer types in the function call, and each is implicitly converted from ""pointer to <code>int</code>/<code>double</code>/<code>long</code>"" to ""pointer to <code>void</code>"".</p>

<p>The comparison functions would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>int compareInt(const void *lhs, const void *rhs)
{
  const int *x = lhs;  // convert void * to int * by assignment
  const int *y = rhs;

  if (*x &gt; *y) return 1;
  if (*x == *y) return 0;
  return -1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>By accepting <code>void *</code>, <code>qsort</code> can work with arrays of any type.  </p>

<p>The disadvantage of using <code>void *</code> is that you throw type safety out the window and into oncoming traffic.  There's nothing to protect you from using the wrong comparison routine:</p>

<pre><code>qsort(dArr, sizeof dArr/sizeof dArr[0], sizeof dArr[0], compareInt);
</code></pre>

<p><code>compareInt</code> is expecting its arguments to be pointing to <code>int</code>s, but is actually working with <code>double</code>s.  There's no way to catch this problem at compile time; you'll just wind up with a mis-sorted array.  </p>

<p>What is the difference between angle bracket <code>&lt; &gt;</code> and double quotes <code>"" ""</code> while including header files in C++?</p>

<p>I mean which files are supposed to be included using eg: <code>#include &lt;QPushButton&gt;</code> and which files are to be included using eg: <code>#include ""MyFile.h""</code>???</p>
","<p>It's compiler dependent.   That said, in general using <code>""</code> prioritizes headers in the current working directory over system headers.  <code>&lt;&gt;</code> usually is used for system headers.  From to the specification (Section 6.10.2):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A preprocessing directive of the form</p>

<pre><code>  # include &lt;h-char-sequence&gt; new-line
</code></pre>
  
  <p>searches a sequence of implementation-defined places for a header identified uniquely by the specified sequence between the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> delimiters, and causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the header. How the places are specified or the header identified is implementation-defined.</p>
  
  <p>A preprocessing directive of the form</p>

<pre><code>  # include ""q-char-sequence"" new-line
</code></pre>
  
  <p>causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the source file identified by the specified sequence between the <code>""</code> delimiters. The named source file is searched for in an implementation-defined manner. If this search is not supported, or if the search fails, the directive is reprocessed as if it read</p>

<pre><code>  # include &lt;h-char-sequence&gt; new-line
</code></pre>
  
  <p>with the identical contained sequence (including <code>&gt;</code> characters, if any) from the original
  directive.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So on <em>most</em> compilers, using the <code>""""</code> first checks your local directory, and if it doesn't find a match then moves on to check the system paths.  Using <code>&lt;&gt;</code> starts the search with system headers.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

<p>1)</p>

<pre><code>scanf(""%d%c"", &amp;rows, &amp;c)
</code></pre>

<p>This means expecting from the user input an integer and close to it a non numeric character.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example1:</em></strong> If the user enter <code>aaddk</code> and then <code>ENTER</code>, the scanf will return 0. Nothing capted</p>

<p><strong><em>Example2:</em></strong> If the user enter <code>45</code> and then <code>ENTER</code>, the scanf will return 2 (2 elements are capted). Here <code>%d</code> is capting <code>45</code> and <code>%c</code> is capting <code>\n</code></p>

<p><strong><em>Example3:</em></strong> If the user enter <code>45aaadd</code> and then <code>ENTER</code>, the scanf will return 2 (2 elements are capted). Here <code>%d</code> is capting <code>45</code> and <code>%c</code> is capting <code>a</code></p>

<p>2)</p>

<pre><code>(scanf(""%d%c"", &amp;rows, &amp;c)!=2 || c!='\n')
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>In the example1:</em></strong> this condition is <code>TRUE</code> because scanf return <code>0</code> (<code>!=2</code>)</p>

<p><strong><em>In the example2:</em></strong> this condition is <code>FALSE</code> because scanf return <code>2</code> and <code>c == '\n'</code></p>

<p><strong><em>In the example3:</em></strong> this condition is <code>TRUE</code> because scanf return <code>2</code> and <code>c == 'a' (!='\n')</code></p>

<p>3)</p>

<pre><code>((scanf(""%d%c"", &amp;rows, &amp;c)!=2 || c!='\n') &amp;&amp; clean_stdin())
</code></pre>

<p><code>clean_stdin()</code> is always <code>TRUE</code> because the function return always <code>1</code></p>

<p><strong><em>In the example1:</em></strong>  The <code>(scanf(""%d%c"", &amp;rows, &amp;c)!=2 || c!='\n')</code> is <code>TRUE</code> so the condition after the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> should be checked so the <code>clean_stdin()</code> will be executed and the whole condition is <code>TRUE</code></p>

<p><strong><em>In the example2:</em></strong> The <code>(scanf(""%d%c"", &amp;rows, &amp;c)!=2 || c!='\n')</code> is <code>FALSE</code> so the condition after the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> will not checked (because what ever its result is the whole condition will be <code>FALSE</code> ) so the <code>clean_stdin()</code> will not be executed and the whole condition is <code>FALSE</code></p>

<p><strong><em>In the example3:</em></strong>  The <code>(scanf(""%d%c"", &amp;rows, &amp;c)!=2 || c!='\n')</code> is <code>TRUE</code> so the condition after the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> should be checked so the <code>clean_stdin()</code> will be executed and the whole condition is <code>TRUE</code></p>

<p>So you can remark that <code>clean_stdin()</code> will be executed only if the user enter a string containing non numeric character.</p>

<p>And this condition <code>((scanf(""%d%c"", &amp;rows, &amp;c)!=2 || c!='\n') &amp;&amp; clean_stdin())</code> will return <code>FALSE</code> only if the user enter an <code>integer</code> and nothing else</p>

<p>And if the condition <code>((scanf(""%d%c"", &amp;rows, &amp;c)!=2 || c!='\n') &amp;&amp; clean_stdin())</code> is <code>FALSE</code> and the <code>integer</code> is between and <code>1</code> and <code>23</code> then the <code>while</code> loop will break else the <code>while</code> loop will continue</p>

<p>Is there a better way <strong>for simple state machines</strong></p>

<p>EDIT:
  For C++, I think the Boost <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/statechart/doc/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Statechart</a> library might be the way to go.  However, it does <strong>not</strong> help with C.  Lets concentrate on the C use case.</p>
","<p>I prefer to use a table driven approach for most state machines:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum { STATE_INITIAL, STATE_FOO, STATE_BAR, NUM_STATES } state_t;
typedef struct instance_data instance_data_t;
typedef state_t state_func_t( instance_data_t *data );

state_t do_state_initial( instance_data_t *data );
state_t do_state_foo( instance_data_t *data );
state_t do_state_bar( instance_data_t *data );

state_func_t* const state_table[ NUM_STATES ] = {
    do_state_initial, do_state_foo, do_state_bar
};

state_t run_state( state_t cur_state, instance_data_t *data ) {
    return state_table[ cur_state ]( data );
};

int main( void ) {
    state_t cur_state = STATE_INITIAL;
    instance_data_t data;

    while ( 1 ) {
        cur_state = run_state( cur_state, &amp;data );

        // do other program logic, run other state machines, etc
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This can of course be extended to support multiple state machines, etc. Transition actions can be accommodated as well:</p>

<pre><code>typedef void transition_func_t( instance_data_t *data );

void do_initial_to_foo( instance_data_t *data );
void do_foo_to_bar( instance_data_t *data );
void do_bar_to_initial( instance_data_t *data );
void do_bar_to_foo( instance_data_t *data );
void do_bar_to_bar( instance_data_t *data );

transition_func_t * const transition_table[ NUM_STATES ][ NUM_STATES ] = {
    { NULL,              do_initial_to_foo, NULL },
    { NULL,              NULL,              do_foo_to_bar },
    { do_bar_to_initial, do_bar_to_foo,     do_bar_to_bar }
};

state_t run_state( state_t cur_state, instance_data_t *data ) {
    state_t new_state = state_table[ cur_state ]( data );
    transition_func_t *transition =
               transition_table[ cur_state ][ new_state ];

    if ( transition ) {
        transition( data );
    }

    return new_state;
};

","<p>question 1)</p>

<p>the header file <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> is included in order to have reference to the input/output function from C library. The <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> contains only function references and not the definition of the functions. The <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> contains references to functions like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>printf</code> (out) output to <code>stdout</code> (default: screen)</p></li>
<li><p><code>scanf</code> (in) reading from <code>stdin</code> (default: keyboard)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>question 2)</p>

<p><code>char *argv[]</code> is an array of pointer. Each pointer element is pointing to a string. Each string is an argument from the command line.</p>

<p>Example: If your program name after compilation is ""myprogram"" and you calling your program as following:</p>

<pre><code>$myprogram -t test1 test2
</code></pre>

<p>So the <code>argv</code> is an array containing 4 pointers to the following string</p>

<p><code>argv[0]</code> is a pointer to the string ""myprogram""</p>

<p><code>argv[1]</code> is a pointer to the string ""-t""</p>

<p><code>argv[2]</code> is a pointer to the string ""test1""</p>

<p><code>argv[3]</code> is a pointer to the string ""test2""</p>

<p>question 3)</p>

<p><code>%d</code> means integer and not double. For double you can use <code>%lf</code> or <code>%g</code></p>

<p>question 4)</p>

<p><code>%s</code> means that you are printing string</p>

<p>example related to <code>argv</code>:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""argv[0] = %s\n"", argv[0]);
printf(""argv[1] = %s\n"", argv[1]);
printf(""argv[2] = %s\n"", argv[2]);
printf(""argv[3] = %s\n"", argv[3]);

argv[1] = -t
argv[2] = test1

<p><strong>In response to Moon's Comment</strong>
rand() generates a random number with an equal probability between 0 and RAND_MAX (a macro pre-defined in stdlib.h)</p>

<p>You can then map this value to a smaller range, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>int random_value = rand(); //between 0 and RAND_MAX

//you can mod the result
int N = 33;
int rand_capped = random_value % N;  //between 0 and 32
int S = 50;
int rand_range = rand_capped + S; //between 50 and 82

//you can convert it to a float
float unit_random = random_value / (float) RAND_MAX; //between 0 and 1 (floating point)
</code></pre>

<p>This might be sufficient for most uses, but its worth pointing out that in the first case using the mod operator introduces a slight bias if N does not divide evenly into RAND_MAX+1.</p>

<p>Random number generators are interesting and complex, it is widely said that the rand() generator in the C standard library is not a great quality random number generator, read (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation</a> for a definition of quality).</p>

<p>If you just want to run the script <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>system</code></a> is the easiest thing to do, but it does some other stuff too, including running a shell and having it run the command (/bin/sh under most *nix).</p>

<p>If you want to either feed the shell script via its standard input or consume its standard output you can use <code>popen</code> (and <code>pclose</code>) to set up a pipe.  This also uses the shell (/bin/sh under most *nix) to run the command.</p>

<p>Both of these are library functions that do a lot under the hood, but if they don't meet your needs (or you just want to experiment and learn) you can also use system calls directly.  This also allows you do avoid having the shell (/bin/sh) run your command for you.</p>

<p>The system calls of interest are <code>fork</code>, <code>execve</code>, and <code>waitpid</code>.  You may want to use one of the library wrappers around <code>execve</code> (type <code>man 3 exec</code> for a list of them).  You may also want to use one of the other wait functions (<code>man 2 wait</code> has them all).  Additionally you may be interested in the system calls <code>clone</code> and <code>vfork</code> which are related to fork.</p>

  <p>It turns out this whole misunderstanding of the open() versus fopen() stems from a buggy I2C driver in the Linux 2.6.14 kernel on an ARM.  Backporting a working bit bashed driver solved the root cause of the problem I was trying to address here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aside: <em>The nature of I2C is that each byte read or written by the master is acknowledged by the device on the other end of the wire (slave) - the pauses improving things encourage me to think of the driver as working asynchronously - something that I can't reconcile with how the bus works.

<p>My problem is that I require the use of the <code>ioctl()</code>, which doesn't use a stream pointer. i.e.</p>

int ran(int i) {
  srand((unsigned int) time(0));

","<p>Several things to point out.</p>

<p>First of all, you cannot assign an array object as you do here:</p>

<pre><code>char A[WIDTH][HEIGHT];  
A=rand_grid(WIDTH,HEIGHT);
</code></pre>

<p>Objects of array type are not modifiable.  </p>

<p>Secondly, functions in C cannot return array types.  They can return <em>pointers</em> to arrays, though:</p>

<pre><code>char (*foo(int width))[HEIGHT]
{
  /**
   * dynamically allocate memory for a widthxHEIGHT array of char
   */
  char (*newArr)[HEIGHT] = malloc(sizeof *newArr * width);
  /**
   * initialize array contents here
   */
  return newArr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax is a little confusing; it reads as </p>

<pre><code>       foo                                   -- foo
       foo(int width)                        -- is a function
                                             -- taking an int parameter
      *foo(int width)                        -- returning a pointer
     (*foo(int width))[HEIGHT]               -- to a HEIGHT-element array
char (*foo(int width))[HEIGHT]               -- of char
</code></pre>

<p>For C89, HEIGHT in the above snippet must be a compile-time constant integral expression (either a macro, a numeric literal, or an arithmetic expression consisting of macros and/or numeric literals).  I'm not sure if that's also true for C99.  </p>

<p>Based on the snippet you've posted, what you want to do is to take an array you've already allocated and initialize its contents.  Remember that in most contexts, an expression of an array type will implicitly be converted to a pointer to the base type.  IOW, if you pass an N-element array of T to a function, what the function actually receives is a pointer to T:</p>

<pre><code>void foo (T *p) {...}
...
T arr[N];
foo(arr);
</code></pre>

<p>For 2-d arrays, it's a little uglier:</p>

<pre><code>void foo (T (*p)[M]) {...}
...
T arr[N][M];
foo(arr);
</code></pre>

<p>This also relies on M being known at compile time, which limits the function's usefulness.  What you'd like is a function that can deal with a 2-d array of arbitrary size.  The best way I know of to accomplish this is instead of passing a pointer to the array, pass the address of the first element in the array[1], and pass the number of rows and columns as separate parameters:</p>

<pre><code>void foo(T *base, size_t rows, size_t cols) {...}
...
T arr[N][M];
foo (&amp;arr[0][0], N, M);
</code></pre>

<p>So your rand_grid function would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>void rand_grid(char *base, size_t rows, size_t cols)
{
  size_t i, j;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; rows; i++)
  {
    for (j = 0; j &lt; cols; j++)
    {
      /**
       * Since base is a simple char *, we must index it
       * as though it points to a 1-d array.  This works if
       * base points to the first element of a 2-d array,
       * since multi-dimensional arrays are contiguous.  
       */
      base[i*cols+j] = initial_value();
    }
  }
}

int main(void)
{
  char A[WIDTH][HEIGHT];
  rand_grid(&amp;A[0][0], WIDTH, HEIGHT);
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>Even though the expressions <code>&amp;A[0][0]</code> and <code>A</code> yield the same value (the base address of A), the types of the two expressions are different.

","<p>I think you are confused about how the compiler puts things together. When you use <code>-c</code> flag, i.e. no linking is done, the input is C++ code, and the output is object code. The <code>.o</code> files thus don't mix with <code>-c</code>, and compiler warns you about that. Symbols from object file are <em>not</em> moved to other object files like that.</p>

<p>All object files should be on the final linker invocation, which is not the case here, so linker (called via <code>g++</code> front-end) complains about missing symbols.</p>

<p>Here's a small example (calling <code>g++</code> explicitly for clarity):</p>

<pre><code>PROG ?= myprog
OBJS = worker.o main.o

all: $(PROG)

.cpp.o:
        g++ -Wall -pedantic -ggdb -O2 -c -o $@ $&lt;

$(PROG): $(OBJS)
        g++ -Wall -pedantic -ggdb -O2 -o $@ $(OBJS)

"Send and Receive a file in socket programming in Linux with C/C++ (GCC/G++)","88156","","<p>I would like to implement a client-server architecture running on Linux using sockets and C/C++ language that is capable of sending and receiving files. Is there any library that makes this task easy? Could anyone please provide an example?</p>
","<p>The most portable solution is just to read the file in chunks, and then write the data out to the socket, in a loop (and likewise, the other way around when receiving the file). You allocate a buffer, <a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/read.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>read</code></a> into that buffer, and <a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/write.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>write</code></a> from that buffer into your socket (you could also use <code>send</code> and <code>recv</code>, which are socket-specific ways of writing and reading data). The outline would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (1) {
    // Read data into buffer.  We may not have enough to fill up buffer, so we
    // store how many bytes were actually read in bytes_read.
    int bytes_read = read(input_file, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    if (bytes_read == 0) // We're done reading from the file
        break;

    if (bytes_read &lt; 0) {
        // handle errors
    }

    // You need a loop for the write, because not all of the data may be written
    // in one call; write will return how many bytes were written. p keeps
    // track of where in the buffer we are, while we decrement bytes_read
    // to keep track of how many bytes are left to write.
    void *p = buffer;
    while (bytes_read &gt; 0) {
        int bytes_written = write(output_socket, p, bytes_read);
        if (bytes_written &lt;= 0) {
            // handle errors
        }
        bytes_read -= bytes_written;
        p += bytes_written;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to read the documentation for <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> carefully, especially when handling errors. Some of the error codes mean that you should just try again, for instance just looping again with a <code>continue</code> statement, while others mean something is broken and you need to stop.</p>

<p>For sending the file to a socket, there is a system call, <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/sendfile.2.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>sendfile</code></a> that does just what you want. It tells the kernel to send a file from one file descriptor to another, and then the kernel can take care of the rest. There is a caveat that the source file descriptor must support <code>mmap</code> (as in, be an actual file, not a socket), and the destination must be a socket (so you can't use it to copy files, or send data directly from one socket to another); it is designed to support the usage you describe, of sending a file to a socket. It doesn't help with receiving the file, however; you would need to do the loop yourself for that. I cannot tell you why there is a <code>sendfile</code> call but no analogous <code>recvfile</code>.</p>

<p>Beware that <code>sendfile</code> is Linux specific; it is not portable to other systems. Other systems frequently have their own version of <code>sendfile</code>, but the exact interface may vary (<a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sendfile&amp;sektion=2"" rel=""noreferrer"">FreeBSD</a>, <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/sendfile.2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mac OS X</a>, <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1467/sendfile-3ext.html#scrolltoc"" rel=""noreferrer"">Solaris</a>).</p>

<p>In Linux 2.6.17, the <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/splice.2.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>splice</code></a> system call was <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/178199/"" rel=""noreferrer"">introduced</a>, and as of 2.6.23 is <a href=""http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_23#head-c8fd2455c44d9559429c0f72dbc85cd54a62470d"" rel=""noreferrer"">used internally to implement <code>sendfile</code></a>. <code>splice</code> is a more general purpose API than <code>sendfile</code>. For a good description of <code>splice</code> and <code>tee</code>, see the rather good <a href=""http://kerneltrap.org/node/6505"" rel=""noreferrer"">explanation from Linus himself</a>. He points out how using <code>splice</code> is basically just like the loop above, using <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>, except that the buffer is in the kernel, so the data doesn't have to transferred between the kernel and user space, or may not even ever pass through the CPU (known as ""zero-copy I/O"").</p>

<p>i'm 2 weeks into this course, it's my first time programming. I'm not allowed to use material that hasn't been taught yet on the assignments, so that's why I asked. I have a few books on C and have googled but still wasn't sure, so I asked. (thanks for all the down-votes) All the examples given below use arrays which hasn't been taught yet, so I'm assuming I can't use %s yet either. Thanks. </p>
","<p>For both <code>*printf</code> and <code>*scanf</code>, <code>%s</code> expects the corresponding argument to be of type <code>char *</code>, and for <code>scanf</code>, it had better point to a writable buffer (i.e., not a string literal).  </p>

char str_buf[] = ""I am an array of char initialized with a string literal"";

<p>Using <code>%s</code> in <code>scanf</code> without an explcit field width opens the same buffer overflow exploit that <code>gets</code> did; namely, if there are more characters in the input stream than the target buffer is sized to hold, <code>scanf</code> will happily write those extra characters to memory outside the buffer, potentially clobbering something important.  Unfortunately, unlike in <code>printf</code>, you can't supply the field with as a run time argument:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""%*s\n"", field_width, string);
</code></pre>

<p>One option is to build the format string dynamically:</p>

<pre><code>char fmt[10];
sprintf(fmt, ""%%%lus"", (unsigned long) (sizeof str_buf) - 1);
...
scanf(fmt, target_buffer); // fmt = ""%55s""
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Using <code>scanf</code> with the <code>%s</code> conversion specifier will stop scanning at the first whitespace character; for example, if your input stream looks like</p>

<pre><code>""This is a test""

<p>then <code>scanf(""%55s"", str_buf)</code> will read and assign <code>""This""</code> to <code>str_buf</code>.  Note that the field with specifier doesn't make a difference in this case.</p>

","<p>The <code>static</code> means that there will be one copy of <code>VAL</code> created for each source file it is included in.  But it also means that multiple inclusions will not result in multiple definitions of <code>VAL</code> that will collide at link time.  In C, without the <code>static</code> you would need to ensure that only one source file defined <code>VAL</code> while the other source files declared it <code>extern</code>. Usually one would do this by defining it (possibly with an initializer) in a source file and put the <code>extern</code> declaration in a header file.</p>

"How do I find the current machine's full hostname in C (hostname and domain information)?","85187","","<p>In a C project (POSIX), how do I get the fully qualified name for the current system?</p>

<p>For example, I can get just the hostname of my machine by doing
<code>gethostname()</code> from unistd.h. This might give me <code>machine3</code> in return, but I'm actually looking for <code>machine3.somedomain.com</code> for example.</p>

<p>How do I go about getting this information? I do not want to use a call to system() to do this, if possible.</p>
","<p>To get a fully qualified name for a machine, we must first get the local hostname, and then lookup the canonical name.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do this is by first getting the local hostname using <code>uname()</code> or <code>gethostname()</code> and then performing a lookup with <code>gethostbyname()</code> and looking at the <code>h_name</code> member of the struct it returns. If you are using ANSI c, you <em>must</em> use <code>uname()</code> instead of <code>gethostname()</code>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>char hostname[1024];
hostname[1023] = '\0';
gethostname(hostname, 1023);
printf(""Hostname: %s\n"", hostname);
struct hostent* h;
h = gethostbyname(hostname);
printf(""h_name: %s\n"", h-&gt;h_name);
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>gethostbyname()</code> is deprecated in the current POSIX specification, as it doesn't play well with IPv6. A more modern version of this code would use <code>getaddrinfo()</code>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>struct addrinfo hints, *info, *p;
int gai_result;

char hostname[1024];
hostname[1023] = '\0';
gethostname(hostname, 1023);

memset(&amp;hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; /*either IPV4 or IPV6*/
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
hints.ai_flags = AI_CANONNAME;

    printf(""hostname: %s\n"", p-&gt;ai_canonname);
}

</code></pre>

<p>You'll need to do a lot of error-handling to ensure that this works correctly, of course, but this should be a good start.  In particular, you'll need to handle the cases where</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>stdin</code> file is closed or broken, so you get nothing at all.</li>
<li>The user enters something invalid.</li>
</ol>

<p>To check for this, you can capture the return code from <code>scanf</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>int result = scanf(""%d"", &amp;myInt);
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>stdin</code> encounters an error while reading, <code>result</code> will be <code>EOF</code>, and you can check for errors like this:</p>

int result = scanf(""%d"", &amp;myInt);

if (result == EOF) {
    /* ... you're not going to get any input ... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>If, on the other hand, the user enters something invalid, like a garbage text string, then you need to read characters out of <code>stdin</code> until you consume all the offending input.  You can do this as follows, using the fact that <code>scanf</code> returns 0 if nothing was read:</p>

<pre><code>int myInt;
int result = scanf(""%d"", &amp;myInt);

if (result == EOF) {
    /* ... you're not going to get any input ... */

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: In response to the more detailed question, here's a more appropriate answer. :-)</p>

<p>The problem with this code is that when you write</p>

<pre><code>printf(""got the number: %d"", scanf(""%d"", &amp;x));
</code></pre>

<p>This is printing the return code from <code>scanf</code>, which is <code>EOF</code> on a stream error, <code>0</code> if nothing was read, and <code>1</code> otherwise.  This means that, in particular, if you enter an integer, this will always print <code>1</code> because you're printing the status code from <code>scanf</code>, not the number you read.</p>

<p>To fix this, change this to</p>

<pre><code>int x;

","<p>On a linux system, you can modify terminal behaviour using the <code>stty</code> command.  By default, the terminal will buffer all information until <kbd>Enter</kbd> is pressed, before even sending it to the C program.</p>

<p>A quick, dirty, and not-particularly-portable example to change the behaviour from within the program itself:</p>

<p>Please note that this isn't really optimal, since it just sort of assumes that <code>stty cooked</code> is the behaviour you want when the program exits, rather than checking what the original terminal settings were.  Also, since all special processing is skipped in raw mode, many key sequences (such as <em>CTRL-C</em> or <em>CTRL-D</em>) won't actually work as you expect them to without explicitly processing them in the program.</p>

<p>How can I do this (or something similar) that lets me write the ""ABCD"" as a normal 'string', and not as four separate characters?</p>

<p>P.S. It seems that people do not read the question correctly...</p>

<p>I can't get the following code to compile:</p>

<pre><code>const char S[] = ""ABCD"";
char t[] = { S[0], S[1], S[2], S[3] };
char u[] = { S[3], S[2], S[1], S[0] };
</code></pre>
","<p>You can't - in C. In C initializing of global and local static variables are designed such that the compiler can put the values statically into the executable. It can't handle non-constant expressions as initializers. And only in C99, you can use non-constant expression in aggregate initializers - not so in C89! </p>

<p>In your case, since your array is an array containing characters, each element has to be an arithmetic constant expression. Look what it says about those</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An arithmetic constant expression shall have arithmetic type and shall only have
  operands that are integer constants, ﬂoating constants, enumeration constants, character
  constants, and sizeof expressions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely this is not satisfied by your initializer, which uses an operand of pointer type. Surely, the other way is to initialize your array using a string literal, as it explains too</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All the expressions in an initializer for an object that has static storage duration shall be constant expressions or string literals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All quotes are taken out of the C99 TC3 committee draft. So to conclude, what you want to do - using non-constant expression - can't be done with C. You have several options: </p>

<ul>
<li>Write your stuff multiple times - one time reversed, and the other time not reversed. </li>
<li>Change the language - C++ can do that all.</li>
<li>If you <em>really</em> want to do that stuff, use an array of <code>char const*</code> instead</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what i mean by the last option</p>

<pre><code>char const c[] = ""ABCD"";
char const *f[] = { &amp;c[0], &amp;c[1], &amp;c[2], &amp;c[3] };
char const *g[] = { &amp;c[3], &amp;c[2], &amp;c[1], &amp;c[0] };
</code></pre>

<p>That works fine, as an address constant expression is used to initialize the pointers</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An address constant is a null pointer, a pointer to an lvalue designating an object of static storage duration, or a pointer to a function designator; it shall be created explicitly using the unary &amp; operator or an integer constant cast to pointer type, or implicitly by the use of an expression of array or function type. The array-subscript [] and member-access . and -> operators, the address &amp; and indirection * unary operators, and pointer casts may be used in the creation of an address constant, but the value of an object shall not be accessed by use of these operators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may have luck tweaking your compiler options - another quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An implementation may accept other forms of constant expressions.</p>

","<p>It should be considered an error. But C is an ancient language, so it's only a warning.<br>
Compiling with <code>-Werror</code> (gcc) fixes this problem.<br></p>

<p>When C doesn't find a declaration, it assumes this implicit declaration: <code>int f();</code>, which means the function can receive whatever you give it, and returns an integer. If this happens to be close enough (and in case of <code>printf</code>, it is), then things can work. In some cases (e.g. the function actually returns a pointer, and pointers are larger than ints), it may cause real trouble.</p>

"Why does the arrow (->) operator in C exist?","84415","","<p>The dot (<code>.</code>) operator is used to access a member of a struct, while the arrow operator (<code>-&gt;</code>) in C is used to access a member of a struct which is referenced by the pointer in question.</p>

<p>The pointer itself does not have any members which could be accessed with the dot operator (it's actually only a number describing a location in virtual memory so it doesn't have any members). So, there would be no ambiguity if we just defined the dot operator to automatically dereference the pointer if it is used on a pointer (an information which is known to the compiler at compile time afaik).</p>

<p>So why have the language creators decided to make things more complicated by adding this seemingly unnecessary operator? What is the big design decision?</p>
","<p>I'll interpret your question as two questions: 1) why <code>-&gt;</code> even exists, and 2) why <code>.</code> does not automatically dereference the pointer. Answers to both questions have historical roots.</p>

<p><strong>Why does <code>-&gt;</code> even exist?</strong></p>

<p>In one of the very first versions of C language (which I will refer as CRM for ""<a href=""https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cman.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">C Reference Manual</a>"", which came with 6th Edition Unix in May 1975), operator <code>-&gt;</code> had very exclusive meaning, not synonymous with <code>*</code> and <code>.</code> combination</p>

<p>The C language described by CRM was very different from the modern C in many respects. In CRM struct members implemented the global concept of <em>byte offset</em>, which could be added to any address value with no type restrictions. I.e. all names of all struct members had independent global meaning (and, therefore, had to be unique). For example you could declare</p>

<pre><code>struct S {
  int a;
  int b;
};
</code></pre>

<p>and name <code>a</code> would stand for offset 0, while name <code>b</code> would stand for offset 2 (assuming <code>int</code> type of size 2 and no padding). The language required all members of all structs in the translation unit either have unique names or stand for the same offset value. E.g. in the same translation unit you could additionally declare</p>

<pre><code>struct X {
  int a;
  int x;
};
</code></pre>

<p>and that would be OK, since the name <code>a</code> would consistently stand for offset 0. But this additional declaration</p>

<pre><code>struct Y {
  int b;
  int a;
};
</code></pre>

<p>would be formally invalid, since it attempted to ""redefine"" <code>a</code> as offset 2 and <code>b</code> as offset 0.</p>

<p>And this is where the <code>-&gt;</code> operator comes in. Since every struct member name had its own self-sufficient global meaning, the language supported expressions like these</p>

<pre><code>int i = 5;
i-&gt;b = 42;  /* Write 42 into `int` at address 7 */
100-&gt;a = 0; /* Write 0 into `int` at address 100 */
</code></pre>

<p>The first assignment was interpreted by the compiler as ""take address <code>5</code>, add offset <code>2</code> to it and assign <code>42</code> to the <code>int</code> value at the resultant address"". I.e. the above would assign <code>42</code> to <code>int</code> value at address <code>7</code>. Note that this use of <code>-&gt;</code> did not care about the type of the expression on the left-hand side. The left hand side was interpreted as an rvalue numerical address (be it a pointer or an integer).</p>

<p>This sort of trickery was not possible with <code>*</code> and <code>.</code> combination. You could not do</p>

<pre><code>(*i).b = 42;
</code></pre>

<p>since <code>*i</code> is already an invalid expression. The <code>*</code> operator, since it is separate from <code>.</code>, imposes more strict type requirements on its operand. To provide a capability to work around this limitation CRM introduced the <code>-&gt;</code> operator, which is independent from the type of the left-hand operand.</p>

<p>As Keith noted in the comments, this difference between <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>*</code>+<code>.</code> combination is what CRM is referring to as ""relaxation of the requirement"" in 7.1.8: <em>Except for the relaxation of the requirement that <code>E1</code> be of pointer type, the expression <code>E1−&gt;MOS</code> is exactly equivalent to <code>(*E1).MOS</code></em></p>

<p>Later, in K&amp;R C many features originally described in CRM were significantly reworked. The idea of ""struct member as global offset identifier"" was completely removed. And the functionality of <code>-&gt;</code> operator became fully identical to the functionality of <code>*</code> and <code>.</code> combination.</p>

<p><strong>Why can't <code>.</code> dereference the pointer automatically?</strong></p>

<p>Again, in CRM version of the language the left operand of the <code>.</code> operator was required to be an <em>lvalue</em>. That was the <em>only</em> requirement imposed on that operand (and that's what made it different from <code>-&gt;</code>, as explained above). Note that CRM did <em>not</em> require the left operand of <code>.</code> to have a struct type. It just required it to be an lvalue, <em>any</em> lvalue. This means that in CRM version of C you could write code like this</p>

<pre><code>struct S { int a, b; };
struct T { float x, y, z; };

struct T c;
c.b = 55;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the compiler would write <code>55</code> into an <code>int</code> value positioned at byte-offset 2 in the continuous memory block known as <code>c</code>, even though type <code>struct T</code> had no field named <code>b</code>. The compiler would not care about the actual type of <code>c</code> at all. All it cared about is that <code>c</code> was an lvalue: some sort of writable memory block. </p>

<p>Now note that if you did this</p>

<pre><code>S *s;
...
s.b = 42;
</code></pre>

<p>the code would be considered valid (since <code>s</code> is also an lvalue) and the compiler would simply attempt to write data <em>into the pointer <code>s</code> itself</em>, at byte-offset 2. Needless to say, things like this could easily result in memory overrun, but the language did not concern itself with such matters.</p>

<p>I.e. in that version of the language your proposed idea about overloading operator <code>.</code> for pointer types would not work: operator <code>.</code> already had very specific meaning when used with pointers (with lvalue pointers or with any lvalues at all). It was very weird functionality, no doubt. But it was there at the time.</p>

<p>Of course, this weird functionality is not a very strong reason against introducing overloaded <code>.</code> operator for pointers (as you suggested) in the reworked version of C - K&amp;R C. But it hasn't been done. Maybe at that time there was some legacy code written in CRM version of C that had to be supported.</p>

<p>You can't make that check. There is simply no way you can check whether a pointer is ""valid"". You have to trust that when people use a function that takes a pointer, those people know what they are doing. If they pass you 0x4211 as a pointer value, then you have to trust it points to address 0x4211. And if they ""accidentally"" hit an object, then even if you would use some scary operation system function (IsValidPtr or whatever), you would still slip into a bug and not fail fast.</p>

<p>Andrey Tarasevich:</p>

<p>The whole idea of using 'do/while' version is to make a macro which will
expand into a regular statement, not into a compound statement. This is
done in order to make the use of function-style macros uniform with the
use of ordinary functions in all contexts.</p>

<p>Consider the following code sketch</p>

<pre><code>if (&lt;condition&gt;)
  foo(a);
else
  bar(a);
</code></pre>

<p>where 'foo' and 'bar' are ordinary functions. Now imagine that you'd
like to replace function 'foo' with a macro of the above nature</p>

<pre><code>if (&lt;condition&gt;)
  CALL_FUNCS(a);
else
  bar(a);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if your macro is defined in accordance with the second approach
(just '{' and '}') the code will no longer compile, because the 'true'
branch of 'if' is now represented by a compound statement. And when you
put a ';' after this compound statement, you finished the whole 'if'
statement, thus orphaning the 'else' branch (hence the compilation error).</p>

<p>One way to correct this problem is to remember not to put ';' after
macro ""invocations""</p>

<pre><code>if (&lt;condition&gt;)
  CALL_FUNCS(a)
else
  bar(a);
</code></pre>

<p>This will compile and work as expected, but this is not uniform. The
more elegant solution is to make sure that macro expand into a regular
statement, not into a compound one. One way to achieve that is to define
the macro as follows</p>

<pre><code>#define CALL_FUNCS(x) \
do { \
  func1(x); \
  func2(x); \
  func3(x); \
} while (0)
</code></pre>

<p>Now this code</p>

<pre><code>if (&lt;condition&gt;)
  CALL_FUNCS(a);
else
  bar(a);
</code></pre>

<p>will compile without any problems.</p>

<p>However, note the small but important difference between my definition
of <code>CALL_FUNCS</code> and the first version in your message. I didn't put a
<code>;</code> after <code>} while (0)</code>. Putting a <code>;</code> at the end of that definition
would immediately defeat the entire point of using 'do/while' and make
that macro pretty much equivalent to the compound-statement version.</p>

<p>I don't know why the author of the code you quoted in your original
message put this <code>;</code> after <code>while (0)</code>. In this form both variants are
equivalent. The whole idea behind using 'do/while' version is not to
include this final <code>;</code> into the macro (for the reasons that I explained
above).</p>

If you have a sparse <code>enum</code> (one that doesn't start at 0 or has gaps in the numbering) where some of the <code>int</code> mappings are high enough to make an array-based mapping impractical then you could use a hash table instead.</p>

"Is gcc's __attribute__((packed)) / #pragma pack unsafe?","82972","","<p>In C, the compiler will lay out members of a struct in the order in which they're declared, with possible padding bytes inserted between members, or after the last member, to ensure that each member is aligned properly.</p>

<p>gcc provides a language extension, <code>__attribute__((packed))</code>, which tells the compiler not to insert padding, allowing struct members to be misaligned.  For example, if the system normally requires all <code>int</code> objects to have 4-byte alignment, <code>__attribute__((packed))</code> can cause <code>int</code> struct members to be allocated at odd offsets.</p>

<p>Quoting the gcc documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The `packed' attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
  should have the smallest possible alignment--one byte for a  variable,
  and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger value with the
  `aligned' attribute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously the use of this extension can result in smaller data requirements but slower code, as the compiler must (on some platforms) generate code to access a misaligned member a byte at a time.</p>

<p>But are there any cases where this is unsafe?  Does the compiler always generate correct (though slower) code to access misaligned members of packed structs?  Is it even possible for it to do so in all cases?</p>
","<p>Yes, <code>__attribute__((packed))</code> is potentially unsafe on some systems.  The symptom probably won't show up on an x86, which just makes the problem more insidious; testing on x86 systems won't reveal the problem.  (On the x86, misaligned accesses are handled in hardware; if you dereference an <code>int*</code> pointer that points to an odd address, it will be a little slower than if it were properly aligned, but you'll get the correct result.)</p>

<p>On some other systems, such as SPARC, attempting to access a misaligned <code>int</code> object causes a bus error, crashing the program.</p>

<p>There have also been systems where a misaligned access quietly ignores the low-order bits of the address, causing it to access the wrong chunk of memory.</p>

<p>Consider the following program:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
int main(void)
{
    struct foo {
        char c;
        int x;
    } __attribute__((packed));
    struct foo arr[2] = { { 'a', 10 }, {'b', 20 } };
    int *p0 = &amp;arr[0].x;
    int *p1 = &amp;arr[1].x;
    printf(""sizeof(struct foo)      = %d\n"", (int)sizeof(struct foo));
    printf(""offsetof(struct foo, c) = %d\n"", (int)offsetof(struct foo, c));
    printf(""offsetof(struct foo, x) = %d\n"", (int)offsetof(struct foo, x));
    printf(""arr[0].x = %d\n"", arr[0].x);
    printf(""arr[1].x = %d\n"", arr[1].x);
    printf(""p0 = %p\n"", (void*)p0);
    printf(""p1 = %p\n"", (void*)p1);
    printf(""*p0 = %d\n"", *p0);
    printf(""*p1 = %d\n"", *p1);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>On x86 Ubuntu with gcc 4.5.2, it produces the following output:</p>

<pre><code>sizeof(struct foo)      = 5
offsetof(struct foo, c) = 0
offsetof(struct foo, x) = 1
arr[0].x = 10
arr[1].x = 20
p0 = 0xbffc104f
p1 = 0xbffc1054
*p0 = 10
*p1 = 20
</code></pre>

<p>On SPARC Solaris 9 with gcc 4.5.1, it produces the following:</p>

<pre><code>sizeof(struct foo)      = 5
offsetof(struct foo, c) = 0
offsetof(struct foo, x) = 1
arr[0].x = 10
arr[1].x = 20
p0 = ffbff317
p1 = ffbff31c
Bus error
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, the program is compiled with no extra options, just <code>gcc packed.c -o packed</code>.</p>

<p>(A program that uses a single struct rather than array doesn't reliably exhibit the problem, since the compiler can allocate the struct on an odd address so the <code>x</code> member is properly aligned.  With an array of two <code>struct foo</code> objects, at least one or the other will have a misaligned <code>x</code> member.)</p>

<p>(In this case, <code>p0</code> points to a misaligned address, because it points to a packed <code>int</code> member following a <code>char</code> member. <code>p1</code> happens to be correctly aligned, since it points to the same member in the second element of the array, so there are two <code>char</code> objects preceding it -- and on SPARC Solaris the array <code>arr</code> appears to be allocated at an address that is even, but not a multiple of 4.)</p>

<p>When referring to the member <code>x</code> of a <code>struct foo</code> by name, the compiler knows that <code>x</code> is potentially misaligned, and will generate additional code to access it correctly.</p>

<p>Once the address of <code>arr[0].x</code> or <code>arr[1].x</code> has been stored in a pointer object, neither the compiler nor the running program knows that it points to a misaligned <code>int</code> object.  It just assumes that it's properly aligned, resulting (on some systems) in a bus error or similar other failure.</p>

<p>Fixing this in gcc would, I believe, be impractical.  A general solution would require, for each attempt to dereference a pointer to any type with non-trivial alignment requirements either (a) proving at compile time that the pointer doesn't point to a misaligned member of a packed struct, or (b) generating bulkier and slower code that can handle either aligned or misaligned objects.</p>

<p>I've submitted a <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51628"" rel=""noreferrer"">gcc bug report</a>.  As I said, I don't believe it's practical to fix it, but the documentation should mention it (it currently doesn't).</p>

<p>If I use the <code>gets()</code> function, I could do this. ENTER YOUR NAME: <code>Keanu Reeves</code>.</p>

<p>If I use the <code>scanf()</code>, I could only do this. ENTER YOUR NAME: <code>Keanu</code></p>

<p>So I heed their advice and replaced all my <code>gets()</code> code with <code>fgets()</code>. The problem is now some of my codes are not working anymore...are there any functions other than <code>gets()</code> and <code>fgets()</code> which could read the whole line and which ignores the whitespace.</p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because <a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/gets.html""><code>gets</code></a> does not take a length parameter, it doesn't know how large your input buffer is. If you pass in a 10-character buffer and the user enters 100 characters -- well, you get the point.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fgets.html""><code>fgets</code></a> is a safer alternative to <code>gets</code> because it takes the buffer length as a parameter, so you can call it like this:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>and it will read in at most 9 characters.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is possibly because <code>fgets</code> also stores the final newline (<code>\n</code>) character in your buffer -- if your code is not expecting this, you should remove it manually:</p>

","<p>You have two typing errors in your code:</p>

<p>Also, depending on the compiler, so simple a cycle might just be optimized out, giving you a time of 0 microseconds whatever you do.</p>

<p>Finally, the time calculation is wrong. You only take into accounts the seconds, ignoring the microseconds. You need to get the difference between seconds, multiply by one million, then add ""after"" <code>tv_usec</code> and subtract ""before"" <code>tv_usec</code>.

"What is the full ""for"" loop syntax in C (and others in case they are compatible)?","82120","","<p>I have seen some very weird <code>for</code> loops when reading other people's code. I have been trying to search for a full syntax explanation for the <code>for</code> loop in <code>C</code> but it is very hard because the word ""<code>for</code>"" appears in unrelated sentences making the search almost impossible to Google effectively.</p>

<p>This question came to my mind after reading <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/260511/russian-peasant-multiplication"">this thread</a> which made me curious again.</p>

<p>The <code>for</code> here: </p>

<pre><code>for(p=0;p+=(a&amp;1)*b,a!=1;a&gt;&gt;=1,b&lt;&lt;=1);
</code></pre>

<p>In the middle condition there is a comma separating the two pieces of code, what does this comma do? The comma on the right side I understand as it makes both <code>a&gt;&gt;=1</code> and <code>b&lt;&lt;=1</code>. </p>

<p>But within a loop exit condition, what happens? Does it exit when <code>p==0</code>, when <code>a==1</code> or when both happen?</p>

<p>It would be great if anyone could help me understand this and maybe point me in the direction of a full <code>for</code> loop syntax description.</p>
","<p>The comma is not exclusive of for loops; it is the comma operator.</p>

<pre><code>x = (a, b);
</code></pre>

<p>will do first a, then b, then set x to the value of b.</p>

<p>The for syntax is:</p>

<pre><code>for (init; condition; increment)
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Which is somewhat (ignoring <code>continue</code> and <code>break</code> for now) equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>init;
while (condition) {
    ...
    increment;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So your for loop example is (again ignoring <code>continue</code> and <code>break</code>) equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>p=0;
while (p+=(a&amp;1)*b,a!=1) {
    ...
    a&gt;&gt;=1,b&lt;&lt;=1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which acts as if it were (again ignoring <code>continue</code> and <code>break</code>):</p>

<pre><code>p=0; 
while (true) {
    p+=(a&amp;1)*b;
    if (a == 1) break;
    ...
    a&gt;&gt;=1;
    b&lt;&lt;=1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Two extra details of the for loop which were not in the simplified conversion to a while loop above:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the condition is omitted, it is always <code>true</code> (resulting in an infinite loop unless a <code>break</code>, <code>goto</code>, or something else breaks the loop).</li>
<li>A <code>continue</code> acts as if it were a goto to a label just before the increment, unlike a <code>continue</code> in the while loop which would skip the increment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, an important detail about the comma operator: it is a sequence point, like <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> (which is why I can split it in separate statements and keep its meaning intact).</p>

<hr>

<h3>Changes in C99</h3>

<p>The C99 standard introduces a couple of nuances not mentioned earlier in this explanation (which is very good for C89/C90).</p>

<p>First, all loops are blocks in their own right.  Effectively,</p>

<pre><code>for (...) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>is itself wrapped in a pair of braces</p>

<pre><code>{
for (...) { ... }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The standard sayeth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>ISO/IEC 9899:1999 §6.8.5 Iteration statements</h3>
  
  <p>¶5 An iteration statement is a block whose scope is a strict subset of the scope of its
  enclosing block. The loop body is also a block whose scope is a strict subset of the scope
  of the iteration statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also described in the Rationale in terms of the extra set of braces.</p>

<p>Secondly, the <code>init</code> portion in C99 can be a (single) declaration, as in</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(something); i++) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Now the 'block wrapped around the loop' comes into its own; it explains why the variable <code>i</code> cannot be accessed outside the loop. You can declare more than one variable, but they must all be of the same type:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0, j = sizeof(something); i &lt; j; i++, j--) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>The standard sayeth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>ISO/IEC 9899:1999 §6.8.5.3 The for statement</h3>
  
  <p>The statement</p>

<pre><code>for ( clause-1 ; expression-2 ; expression-3 ) statement
</code></pre>
  
  <p>behaves as follows: The expression expression-2 is the controlling expression that is
  evaluated before each execution of the loop body. The expression expression-3 is
  evaluated as a void expression after each execution of the loop body. If clause-1 is a
  declaration, the scope of any variables it declares is the remainder of the declaration and
  the entire loop, including the other two expressions; it is reached in the order of execution
  before the first evaluation of the controlling expression. If clause-1 is an expression, it is
  evaluated as a void expression before the first evaluation of the controlling expression.<sup>133)</sup></p>
  
  <p>Both clause-1 and expression-3 can be omitted. An omitted expression-2 is replaced by a
  nonzero constant.</p>
  
  <p><sup>133)</sup> Thus, clause-1 specifies initialization for the loop, possibly declaring one or more variables for use in
  the loop; the controlling expression, expression-2, specifies an evaluation made before each iteration,
  such that execution of the loop continues until the expression compares equal to 0; and expression-3
  specifies an operation (such as incrementing) that is performed after each iteration.</p>

","<p>As already stated, you can use <code>sigaction</code> to trap ctrl-c, or <code>select</code> to trap any standard input.</p>

<p>Note however that with the latter method you also need to set the TTY so that it's in character-at-a-time rather than line-at-a-time mode.  The latter is the default - if you type in a line of text it doesn't get sent to the running program's stdin until you press enter.</p>

I've successfully filtered out noise from both sensors and derived angles for both in a range between -90 and 90 degrees, with 0 degrees being perfectly balanced.</p>

<p>My next challenge is to combine both of the sensor values to correct for the Gyroscope's drift over time. Below is an example graph I created from actual data to demonstrate the drift from the gyroscope:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHx4r.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The most commonly used approach I've seen to make combining these sensors rock solid is by using a Kalman filter. However, I'm not an expert in calculus and I really don't understand mathematical symbols, I do understand math in source code though.</p>

<p>I'm using RobotC (which is like any other C derivative) and would really appreciate if someone can give me examples of how to accomplish this in C.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION RESULTS:</strong></p>

<p>Alright, kersny solved my problem by introducing me to complementary filters. This is a graph illustrating my results:</p>

<p><em>Result #1</em></p>

<p><em>Result #2</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mePBt.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see, the filter corrects for gyroscopic drift and combines both signals into a single smooth signal.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Since I was fixing the broken images anyways, I thought it would be fun to show the rig I used to generate this data:</p>

"Cannot assign requested address - possible causes?","81166","","<p>I have a program that consists of a master server and distributed slave servers.

"When should I use mmap for file access?","81034","","<p>POSIX environments provide at least two ways of accessing files.  There's the standard system calls <code>open()</code>, <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, and friends, but there's also the option of using <code>mmap()</code> to map the file into virtual memory.</p>

<p>When is it preferable to use one over the other?  What're their individual advantages that merit including two interfaces?</p>
","<p>mmap is great if you have multiple processes accessing data in a read only fashion from the same file, which is common in the kind of server systems I write.  mmap allows all those processes to share the same physical memory pages, saving a lot of memory.</p>

<p>mmap also allows the operating system to optimize paging operations.  For example, consider two programs; program A which reads in a 1MB file into a buffer creating with malloc, and program B which mmaps the 1MB file into memory.  If the operating system has to swap part of A's memory out, it must write the contents of the buffer to swap before it can reuse the memory.  In B's case any unmodified mmap'd pages can be reused immediately because the OS knows how to restore them from the existing file they were mmap'd from.  (The OS can detect which pages are unmodified by initially marking writable mmap'd pages as read only and catching seg faults, similar to Copy on Write strategy).  </p>

<p>mmap is also useful for inter process communication.  You can mmap a file as read / write in the processes that need to communicate and then use sychronization primitives in the mmap'd region (this is what the MAP_HASSEMAPHORE flag is for).</p>

<p>One place mmap can be awkward is if you need to work with very large files on a 32 bit machine.  This is because mmap has to find a contiguous block of addresses in your process's address space that is large enough to fit the entire range of the file being mapped.  This can become a problem if your address space becomes fragmented, where you might have 2 GB of address space free, but no individual range of it can fit a 1 GB file mapping.  In this case you may have to map the file in smaller chunks than you would like to make it fit.</p>

<p>Another potential awkwardness with mmap as a replacement for read / write is that you have to start your mapping on offsets of the page size.  If you just want to get some data at offset X you will need to fixup that offset so it's compatible with mmap.</p>

<p>And finally, read / write are the only way you <strong>can</strong> work with some types of files.  mmap can't be used on things like pipes and ttys.</p>

Or put another way: what's to stop other languages from being able to compile down to binary that runs every bit as fast as C?</p>

<p>Long explanation:</p>

<p>In <code>pthread_join</code>, you get back the address passed to <code>pthread_exit</code> by the finished thread. If you pass just a plain pointer, it is passed by value so you can't change where it is pointing to.

<p>X Window defines a network protocol for communication, and any program that knows how to ""speak"" this protocol can use it. There is a C library called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib"" rel=""noreferrer"">Xlib</a> that makes it easier to use this protocol, so Xlib is kind of <em>the</em> native GUI API. Xlib is not the only way to access an X Window server; there is also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCB"" rel=""noreferrer"">XCB</a>.</p>

<p>Toolkit libraries such as <a href=""http://www.gtk.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GTK+</a> (used by <a href=""http://www.gnome.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GNOME</a>) and <a href=""http://www.qt.io/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Qt</a> (used by <a href=""http://www.kde.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">KDE</a>), built on top of Xlib, are used because they are easier to program with. For example they give you a consistent look and feel across applications, make it easier to use drag-and-drop, provide components standard to a modern desktop environment, and so on.</p>

<p>How X draws on the screen internally depends on the implementation. <a href=""http://www.x.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">X.org</a> has a device independent part and a device dependent part. The former manages screen resources such as windows, while the latter communicates with the graphics card driver, usually a kernel module.

<p>As of 2013, a new window system called <a href=""http://wayland.freedesktop.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wayland</a> is starting to become usable, and many distributions have said they will at some point migrate to it, though there is still no clear schedule. This system is based on OpenGL/ES API, which means that in the future OpenGL will be the ""native GUI API"" in Linux. Work is being done to port GTK+ and QT to Wayland, so that current popular applications and desktop systems would need minimal changes. The applications that cannot be ported will be supported through an X11 server, much like OS X supports X11 apps through Xquartz. The GTK+ port is <a href=""https://live.gnome.org/Wayland"" rel=""noreferrer"">expected to be finished within a year</a>, while Qt 5 already has complete Wayland support.</p>

<p>To further complicate matters, Ubuntu has announced they are developing a new system called <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mir"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mir</a> because of problems they perceive with Wayland. This window system is also based on the OpenGL/ES API.</p>

","<p>You have to seed it. Seeding it with the time is a good idea:</p>

<p>You get the same sequence because rand() is automatically seeded with the a value of 1 if you do not call srand().</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p><em>Due to comments</em></p>

<p><code>rand()</code> will return a number between 0 and <code>RAND_MAX</code> (defined in the standard library). Using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation"" rel=""noreferrer"">modulo</a> operator (<code>%</code>) gives the remainder of the division <code>rand()/100</code>. This will force the random number to be within the range 0-99. For example, to get a random number in the range of 0-999 we would apply <code>rand()%1000</code>.</p>

{
    int someVariable = 5;

#ifdef DEBUG_ENABLED
    printf(""Debugging: someVariable == %d"", someVariable);
#endif
}

","<p>My initial reaction was <em><code>#ifdef</code>, of course</em>, but I think <code>#if</code> actually has some significant advantages for this - here's why:</p>

<p>First, you can use <code>DEBUG_ENABLED</code> in preprocessor <em>and</em> compiled tests. Example - Often, I want longer timeouts when debug is enabled, so using <code>#if</code>, I can write this</p>

<pre><code>  DoSomethingSlowWithTimeout(DEBUG_ENABLED? 5000 : 1000);
</code></pre>

<p>... instead of ...</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef DEBUG_MODE
  DoSomethingSlowWithTimeout(5000);
#else
  DoSomethingSlowWithTimeout(1000);
#endif

<p>Second, you're in a better position if you want to migrate from a <code>#define</code> to a global constant. <code>#define</code>s are usually frowned on by most C++ programmers.</p>

<p>And, Third, you say you've a divide in your team. My guess is this means different members have already adopted different approaches, and you need to standardise. Ruling that <code>#if</code> is the preferred choice means that code using <code>#ifdef</code> will compile -and run- even when <code>DEBUG_ENABLED</code> is false. And it's <em>much</em> easier to track down and remove debug output that is produced when it shouldn't be than vice-versa.</p>

<p>Oh, and a minor readability point. You should be able to use true/false rather than 0/1 in your <code>#define</code>, and because the value is a single lexical token, it's the one time you don't need parentheses around it. </p>

<p>So is it good to use global variable instead of volatile?
<p>Any specific reason to use static volatile??
<p>Any example program would be appreciable.
<p>Thanks in advance..</p>
","<p>They are different things. I'm not an expert in volatile semantics. But i think it makes sense what is described here.</p>

<h3>Global</h3>

<p>Global just means the identifier in question is declared at file-scope. There are different scopes, called  function (where goto-labels are defined in), ﬁle (where globals reside), block (where normal local variables reside), and function prototype (where function parameters reside). This concept just exist to structure the visibility of identifiers. It doesn't have anything to do with optimizations. </p>

<h3>Static</h3>

<p><code>static</code> is a storage duration (we won't look at that here) and a way to give a name declared within file scope internal linkage. This can be done for functions or objects only required within one translation unit. A typical example might be a <code>help</code> function printing out the accepted parameters, and which is only called from the <code>main</code> function defined in the same <code>.c</code> file. </p>

<p><strong>6.2.2/2</strong> in a C99 draft:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the declaration of a ﬁle scope
  identiﬁer for an object or a function
  contains  the storage class speciﬁer
  static, the identiﬁer has internal
  linkage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Internal linkage means that the identifier is not visible outside the current translation unit (like the <code>help</code> function of above). </p>

<h3>Volatile</h3>

<p>Volatile is a different thing: (<strong>6.7.3/6</strong>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An object that has volatile-qualiﬁed
  type may be modiﬁed in ways unknown to
  the implementation or have other
  unknown side effects. Therefore any
  expression referring to such an object
  shall be evaluated strictly according
  to the rules of the abstract machine,
  as described in 5.1.2.3. Furthermore,
  at every sequence point the value last
  stored in the object shall agree with
  that prescribed by the abstract
  machine, except as modiﬁed by the
  unknown factors mentioned
  previously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Standard provides an excellent example for an example where <code>volatile</code> would be redundant (<strong>5.1.2.3/8</strong>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An implementation might deﬁne a
  one-to-one correspondence between
  abstract and actual semantics: at
  every sequence point, the values of
  the actual objects would agree with
  those speciﬁed by the abstract
  semantics. The keyword <code>volatile</code>
  would then be redundant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sequence points are points where the effect of side effects concerning the <em>abstract machine</em> are completed (i.e external conditions like memory cell values are not included). Between the right and the left of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>, after <code>;</code> and returning from a function call are sequence points for example. </p>

<p>The <em>abstract semantics</em> is what the compiler can deduce from seeing only the sequence of code within a particular program. Effects of optimizations are irrelevant here. <em>actual semantics</em> include the effect of side effects done by writing to objects (for example, changing of memory cells). Qualifying an object as volatile means one always gets the value of an object straight from memory (""as modified by the unknown factors""). The Standard doesn't mention threads anywhere, and if you must rely on the order of changes, or on atomicity of operations, you should use platform dependent ways to ensure that.</p>

<p>For an easy to understand overview, intel has a great article about it <a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2007/11/30/volatile-almost-useless-for-multi-threaded-programming/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<h3>What should i do now?</h3>

<p>Keep declaring your file-scope (global) data as volatile. Global data in itself does not mean the variables' value will equal to the value stored in memory. And static does only make your objects local to the current translation unit (the current <code>.c</code> files and all other files #include'ed by it). </p>

zero_1 is the slowest, except for -O3. zero_sizet is the fastest with roughly equal performance across -O1, -O2 and -O3. memset was always slower than zero_sizet. (twice as slow for -O3). one thing of interest is that at -O3 zero_1 was equally fast as zero_sizet. however the disassembled function had roughly four times as many instructions (I think caused by loop unrolling). Also, I tried optimizing zero_sizet further, but the compiler always outdid me, but no surprise here.</strike> </p>

<p>at the end of functions that don't return a value. This isn't used in PHP, because if a function is doesn't have a return, a value NULL is automatically returned.  </p>

<p>All I'm asking is, in simple English, what does the <code>return 0</code> actually do? Is it like PHP, where it returns its argument as the value of the function call? Is it just good practice?</p>

<p>I know this question has been asked many times before, but I'm asking it from the point of view of a PHP developer. The answers google throws up haven't been that concise.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is it like php, where it returns its argument as the value of the
  function call? Is it just good practise?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, PHP and many other languages borrowed the <code>return</code> keyword from 'C'. And in all the languages, the <code>return</code> keyword has the same function - to return from the function. Anything that follows <code>return</code> keyword is the value that is returned to the caller.</p>

<p>Is it a good practise? Yes and No. Not all functions <strong>should</strong> return a value. And quite a few in the standard library even, do not return any value. Hence their return type is <code>void</code>.</p>

<p>But <code>main</code> function should return <code>0</code>(also <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code>) to identify that the program has executed successfully. And -1 otherwise (also <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code>)</p>

<p>EDIT: (Thanks to @KeithThompson):</p>

<p><code>EXIT_FAILURE</code> is implementation defined. <code>1</code> is a common value of <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code> but the whole point is, you need not know.</p>

"The maximum size of an array in C","78990","","<p>I understand that hardware will limit the amount of memory allocated during program execution. However, my question is <strong>without regard to hardware.</strong> Assuming that there was no limit to the amount of memory, would there be no limit to the array?</p>
","<p>There is no <em>fixed</em> limit to the size of an array in C.</p>

<p>The size of any single object, including of any array object, is limited by <code>SIZE_MAX</code>, the maximum value of type <code>size_t</code>, which is the result of the <code>sizeof</code> operator.  (It's not entirely clear whether the C standard permits objects larger than <code>SIZE_MAX</code> bytes, but in practice such objects are not supported; see footnote.)  Since <code>SIZE_MAX</code> is determined by the implementation, and cannot be modified by any program, that imposes an upper bound of <code>SIZE_MAX</code> bytes for any single object.</p>

<p>The width of the type <code>void*</code>, a generic pointer type, imposes an upper bound on the total size of all objects in an executing program (which may be larger than the maximum size of a single object).</p>

<p>The C standard imposes lower bounds, but not upper bounds, on these fixed sizes.  No conforming C implementation can support infinite-sized objects, but it can in principle support objects of any finite size.  Upper bounds are imposed by individual C implementations, by the environments in which they operate, and by physics, not by the language.</p>

<p>For example, a conforming implementation could have <code>SIZE_MAX</code> equal to 2<sup>1024</sup>-1, which means it could <em>in principle</em> have objects up to 179769313486231590772930519078902473361797697894230657273430081157732675805500963132708477322407536021120113879871393357658789768814416622492847430639474124377767893424865485276302219601246094119453082952085005768838150682342462881473913110540827237163350510684586298239947245938479716304835356329624224137215 bytes.</p>

<p>Good luck finding hardware that actually supports such objects.</p>

<p><em>Footnote</em>: There is no explicit rule that no object can be bigger than <code>SIZE_MAX</code> bytes.  You couldn't usefully apply the <code>sizeof</code> operator to such an object, but like any other operator, <code>sizeof</code> can overflow; that doesn't mean you couldn't perform operations on such an object.  But in practice, any sane implementation will make <code>size_t</code> big enough to represent the size of any object it supports.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Data structure alignment</strong> is the way data is arranged and accessed in computer memory. It consists of two separate but related issues: <em>data alignment</em> and <em>data structure padding</em>.</p>

<p>When a modern computer reads from or writes to a memory address, it will do this in word sized chunks (e.g. 4 byte chunks on a 32-bit system). <strong><em>Data alignment</em></strong> means putting the data at a memory offset equal to some multiple of the word size, which increases the system's performance due to the way the CPU handles memory.</p>

<p>To align the data, it may be necessary to insert some meaningless bytes between the end of the last data structure and the start of the next, which is <strong><em>data structure padding</em></strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>gcc provides facility to avoid structure padding. i.e To avoid this meaningless bytes in some cases. Consider the following structure</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
     char Data1;
     int Data2;
     unsigned short Data3;
     char Data4;

}sSampleStruct;
</code></pre>

<p><code>sizeof(sSampleStruct)</code> will be 12 rather than 8. Because of structure padding. By default, In X86, structures will be padded to 4-byte alignment. <br/></p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
     char Data1;
     //3-Bytes Added here.
     int Data2;
     unsigned short Data3;
     char Data4;
     //1-byte Added here.

}sSampleStruct;
</code></pre>

<p>We can use <code>__attribute__((packed, aligned(X)))</code> to insist particular(X) sized padding. X should be powers of two. Refer <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11667181/why-does-padding-have-to-be-a-power-of-two"">here</a></p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
     char Data1;
     int Data2;
     unsigned short Data3;
     char Data4;

}__attribute__((packed, aligned(1))) sSampleStruct;  
</code></pre>

<p>so the above specified gcc attribute does not allow the structure padding. so the size will be 8 bytes.</p>

<p>If you wish to do the same for all the structures, simply we can push the alignment value to stack using <code>#pragma</code> </p>

"What REALLY happens when you don't free after malloc?","78457","","<p>This has been something that has bothered me for ages now.</p>

<p>We are all taught in school (at least, I was) that you MUST free every pointer that is allocated.  I'm a bit curious, though, about the real cost of not freeing memory.  In some obvious cases, like when <code>malloc</code> is called inside a loop or part of a thread execution, it's very important to free so there are no memory leaks.  But consider the following two examples:</p>

<p>First, if I have code that's something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
    char *a = malloc(1024);
    /* Do some arbitrary stuff with 'a' (no alloc functions) */
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What's the real result here?  My thinking is that the process dies and then the heap space is gone anyway so there's no harm in missing the call to <code>free</code> (however, I do recognize the importance of having it anyway for closure, maintainability, and good practice).  Am I right in this thinking?</p>

<p>Second, let's say I have a program that acts a bit like a shell.  Users can declare variables like <code>aaa = 123</code> and those are stored in some dynamic data structure for later use.  Clearly, it seems obvious that you'd use some solution that will calls some *alloc function (hashmap, linked list, something like that).  For this kind of program, it doesn't make sense to ever free after calling <code>malloc</code> because these variables must be present at all times during the program's execution and there's no good way (that I can see) to implement this with statically allocated space.  Is it bad design to have a bunch of memory that's allocated but only freed as part of the process ending?  If so, what's the alternative?</p>
","<p>Just about every modern operating system will recover all the allocated memory space after a program exits.  The only exception I can think of might be something like Palm OS where the program's static storage and runtime memory are pretty much the same thing, so not freeing might cause the program to take up more storage.  (I'm only speculating here.)</p>

<p>So generally, there's no harm in it, except the runtime cost of having more storage than you need.  Certainly in the example you give, you want to keep the memory for a variable that might be used until it's cleared.</p>

<p>However, it's considered good style to free memory as soon as you don't need it any more, and to free anything you still have around on program exit.  It's more of an exercise in knowing what memory you're using, and thinking about whether you still need it.  If you don't keep track, you might have memory leaks.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the similar admonition to close your files on exit has a much more concrete result - if you don't, the data you wrote to them might not get flushed, or if they're a temp file, they might not get deleted when you're done.  Also, database handles should have their transactions committed and then closed when you're done with them.  Similarly, if you're using an object oriented language like C++ or Objective C, not freeing an object when you're done with it will mean the destructor will never get called, and any resources the class is responsible might not get cleaned up.</p>

<p>Is <code>Objective-C</code> handling this internally when comparing or can it happen that a <code>origin.x</code> which reads as zero does not compare to <code>0</code> as true?</p>
","<p>First of all, floating point values are not ""random"" in their behavior. Exact comparison can and does make sense in plenty of real-world usages. But if you're going to use floating point you need to be aware of how it works. Erring on the side of assuming floating point works like real numbers will get you code that quickly breaks. Erring on the side of assuming floating point results have large random fuzz associated with them (like most of the answers here suggest) will get you code that appears to work at first but ends up having large-magnitude errors and broken corner cases.</p>

<p>First of all, if you want to program with floating point, you should read this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html"">What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic</a></p>

<p>Yes, read all of it. If that's too much of a burden, you should use integers/fixed point for your calculations until you have time to read it. :-)</p>

<p>Now, with that said, the biggest issues with exact floating point comparisons come down to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The fact that lots of values you may write in the source, or read in with <code>scanf</code> or <code>strtod</code>, <em>do not exist</em> as floating point values and get silently converted to the nearest approximation. This is what demon9733's answer was talking about.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that many results get rounded due to not having enough precision to represent the actual result. An easy example where you can see this is adding <code>x = 0x1fffffe</code> and <code>y = 1</code> as floats. Here, <code>x</code> has 24 bits of precision in the mantissa (ok) and <code>y</code> has just 1 bit, but when you add them, their bits are not in overlapping places, and the result would need 25 bits of precision. Instead, it gets rounded (to <code>0x2000000</code> in the default rounding mode).</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that many results get rounded due to needing infinitely many places for the correct value. This includes both rational results like 1/3 (which you're familiar with from decimal where it takes infinitely many places) but also 1/10 (which also takes infinitely many places in binary, since 5 is not a power of 2), as well as irrational results like the square root of anything that's not a perfect square.</p></li>
<li><p>Double rounding. On some systems (particularly x86), floating point expressions are evaluated in higher precision than their nominal types. This means that when one of the above types of rounding happens, you'll get two rounding steps, first a rounding of the result to the higher-precision type, then a rounding to the final type. As an example, consider what happens in decimal if you round 1.49 to an integer (1), versus what happens if you first round it to one decimal place (1.5) then round that result to an integer (2). This is actually one of the nastiest areas to deal with in floating point, since the behaviour of the compiler (especially for buggy, non-conforming compilers like GCC) is unpredictable.</p></li>
<li><p>Transcendental functions (<code>trig</code>, <code>exp</code>, <code>log</code>, etc.) are not specified to have correctly rounded results; the result is just specified to be correct within one unit in the last place of precision (usually referred to as <strong>1ulp</strong>).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When you're writing floating point code, you need to keep in mind what you're doing with the numbers that could cause the results to be inexact, and make comparisons accordingly. Often times it will make sense to compare with an ""epsilon"", but that epsilon should be based on the <em>magnitude of the numbers you are comparing</em>, not an absolute constant. (In cases where an absolute constant epsilon would work, that's strongly indicative that fixed point, not floating point, is the right tool for the job!)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In particular, a magnitude-relative epsilon check should look something like:</p>

<pre><code>if (fabs(x-y) &lt; K * FLT_EPSILON * fabs(x+y))
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>FLT_EPSILON</code> is the constant from <code>float.h</code> (replace it with <code>DBL_EPSILON</code> for<code>double</code>s or <code>LDBL_EPSILON</code> for <code>long double</code>s) and <code>K</code> is a constant you choose such that the accumulated error of your computations is definitely bounded by <code>K</code> units in the last place (and if you're not sure you got the error bound calculation right, make <code>K</code> a few times bigger than what your calculations say it should be).</p>

<p>Finally, note that if you use this, some special care may be needed near zero, since <code>FLT_EPSILON</code> does not make sense for denormals. A quick fix would be to make it:</p>

<pre><code>if (fabs(x-y) &lt; K * FLT_EPSILON * fabs(x+y) || fabs(x-y) &lt; FLT_MIN)
</code></pre>

<p>and likewise substitute <code>DBL_MIN</code> if using doubles.</p>

","<p>I think by default values read by scanf with space/enter. Well you can provide space between '%d' if you are printing integers. Also same for other cases.</p>

<pre><code>scanf(""%d %d %d"", &amp;var1, &amp;var2, &amp;var3);

<p>Similarly if you want to read comma separated values use :</p>

<pre><code>scanf(""%d,%d,%d"", &amp;var1, &amp;var2, &amp;var3);

"When is assembly faster than C?","77235","","<p>One of the stated reasons for knowing assembler is that, on occasion, it can be employed to write code that will be more performant than writing that code in a higher-level language, C in particular.  However, I've also heard it stated many times that although that's not entirely false, the cases where assembler can <strong>actually</strong> be used to generate more performant code are both extremely rare and require expert knowledge of and experience with assembly.  </p>

<p>This question doesn't even get into the fact that assembler instructions will be machine-specific and non-portable, or any of the other aspects of assembler.  There are plenty of good reasons for knowing assembly besides this one, of course, but this is meant to be a specific question soliciting examples and data, not an extended discourse on assembler versus higher-level languages.</p>

<p>Can anyone provide some <strong>specific examples</strong> of cases where assembly will be faster than well-written C code using a modern compiler, and can you support that claim with profiling evidence?  I am pretty confident these cases exist, but I really want to know exactly how esoteric these cases are, since it seems to be a point of some contention.</p>
","<p>Here is a real world example: Fixed point multiplies. </p>

<p>These don't only come handy on devices without floating point, they shine when it comes to precision as they give you 32 bits of precision with a predictable error (float only has 23 bit and it's harder to predict precision loss)</p>

<p>One way to write a fixed point multiply on a 32 bit architecture looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>int inline FixedPointMul (int a, int b)
{
  long long a_long = a; // cast to 64 bit.

  long long product = a_long * b; // perform multiplication

  return (int) (product &gt;&gt; 16);  // shift by the fixed point bias
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this code is that we do something that can't be directly expressed in the C-language. We want to multiply two 32 bit numbers and get a 64 bit result of which we return the middle 32 bit. However, in C this multiply does not exist. All you can do is to promote the integers to 64 bit and do a 64*64 = 64 multiply. </p>

<p>The x86 (ARM, MIPS and others) can however do the multiply in a single instruction. Lots of compilers still ignore this fact and generate code that calls a runtime library function to do the multiply. The shift by 16 is also often done by a library routine (also the x86 can do such shifts).</p>

<p>So we're left with one or two library calls just for a multiply. This has serious consequences. Not only is the shift slower, registers must be preserved across the function calls and it does not help inlining and code-unrolling either. </p>

<p>If you rewrite the same code in assembler you can gain a significant speed boost.</p>

<p>In addition to this: using ASM is not the best way to solve the problem. Most compilers allow you to use some assembler instructions in intrinsic form if you can't express them in C. The VS.NET2008 compiler for example exposes the 32*32=64 bit mul as __emul and the 64 bit shift as __ll_rshift.</p>

<p>Using intrinsics you can rewrite the function in a way that the C-compiler has a chance to understand what's going on. This allows the code to be inlined, register allocated, common subexpression elimination and constant propagation can be done as well. You'll get a <em>huge</em> performance improvement over the hand-written assembler code that way.</p>

<p>For reference: The end-result for the fixed-point mul for the VS.NET compiler is:</p>

<pre><code>int inline FixedPointMul (int a, int b)
{
    return (int) __ll_rshift(__emul(a,b),16);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The performance difference of fixed point divides are even worse. I had improvements up to factor 10 for division heavy fixed point code by writing a couple of asm-lines.</p>

<p>Using Visual C++ 2013 gives the same assembly code for both ways.</p>

"What is the difference between vmalloc and kmalloc?","77178","","<p>I've googled around and found most people advocating the use of <code>kmalloc</code>, as you're guaranteed to get contiguous physical blocks of memory.

What are the advantages of having a contiguous block of memory? Specifically, why would I need to have a contiguous <strong>physical</strong> block of memory in a <em>system call</em>? Is there any reason I couldn't just use <code>vmalloc</code>?<br>
Finally, if I were to allocate memory during the handling of a system call, should I specify <code>GFP_ATOMIC</code>?  Is a system call executed in an atomic context?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>GFP_ATOMIC</code><br>
  The allocation is high-priority and
  does not sleep. This is the flag to
  use in interrupt handlers, bottom
  halves and other situations where you
  cannot sleep.</p>
  
  <p><code>GFP_KERNEL</code>
  This is a normal allocation and might block. This is the flag to use
  in process context code when it is safe to sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>You only need to worry about using physically contiguous memory if the buffer will be accessed by a DMA device on a physically addressed bus (like PCI). The trouble is that many system calls have no way to know whether their buffer will eventually be passed to a DMA device: once you pass the buffer to another kernel subsystem, you really cannot know where it is going to go. Even if the kernel does not use the buffer for DMA <I>today,</I> a future development might do so.</p>

<p>vmalloc is often slower than kmalloc, because it may have to remap the buffer space into a virtually contiguous range. kmalloc never remaps, though if not called with GFP_ATOMIC kmalloc can block.</p>

<p>kmalloc is limited in the size of buffer it can provide: 128 KBytes<sup>*)</sup>. If you need a really big buffer, you have to use vmalloc or some other mechanism like reserving high memory at boot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>*)</sup> <em>This was true of earlier kernels. On recent kernels (I tested this on 2.6.33.2), max size of a single kmalloc is up to 4 MB!

<p>For a system call you don't need to pass GFP_ATOMIC to kmalloc(), you can use GFP_KERNEL. You're not an interrupt handler: the application code enters the kernel context by means of a trap, it is not an interrupt.</p>

To verify, <code>stat</code> the filename given and <code>fstat</code> the fd you have, and make sure <code>st_dev</code> and <code>st_ino</code> are the same.</p>

<p>Of course, not all file descriptors refer to files, and for those you'll see some odd text strings, such as <code>pipe:[1538488]</code>. Since all of the real filenames will be absolute paths, you can determine which these are easily enough. Further, as others have noted, files can have multiple hardlinks pointing to them - this will only report the one it was opened with. If you want to find all names for a given file, you'll just have to traverse the entire filesystem.</p>

<p><em>(Note: I changed Bjarne's code to check for <code>isspace()</code> instead of just end of line.  Also, due to @matejkramny's comment, to use <code>while(1)</code> instead of <code>while(true)</code>...and so long as we're being heretical enough to edit Stroustrup's code, I've subbed in C89 comments instead of C++ style too.  :-P)</em></p>

    int max = 20;

    while (1) {
        int c = getchar();

<p>That covers:</p>

<ul>
<li>skipping whitespace until you reach character input</li>
<li>expanding the string buffer dynamically to fit arbitrary size strings</li>
<li>handling conditions of when memory can't be allocated</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there simpler but broken solutions, which might even run a bit faster?  Absolutely!!</p>

<p>If you use scanf into a buffer with no limit on the read size, then your input exceeds the size of the buffer, it will create a security hole and/or crash.</p>

<p>Limiting the size of the reading to, say, only 100 unique characters of a filename might seem better than crashing.  But it can be worse; for instance if the user meant <code>(...)/dir/foo/bar.txt</code> but you end up misinterpreting their input and overwriting a file called <code>bar.t</code> which perhaps they cared about.</p>

<p>It's best to get into good habits early in dealing with these issues.  <em>My opinion</em> is that if your requirements justify something close-to-the-metal and ""C-like"", it's well worth it to consider the jump to C++.  It was designed to manage precisely these concerns--with techniques that are robust and extensible, yet still perform well.</p>

"scanf: ""%[^\n]"" skips the 2nd input but "" %[^\n]"" does not. why?","76174","","<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main (void)

  printf (""\nEnter str1: "");

  scanf (""%[^\n]"", str3);
  printf (""\nstr3 = %s"", str3);

  printf (""\n"");
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When it is executed only the first <code>scanf</code> stops for the prompt. The program does not stop for the next <code>scanf</code> s. But if the format string is changed from <code>""%[^\n]""</code> to <code>"" %[^\n]""</code> (note the blank space before <code>%</code>), then it works okay. Does some existing newline character from the previous input buffer is automatically accepted ? But flushing <code>stdin</code> does not solve this.</p>

<p>What is the cause of this.</p>
","<p>You just need to 'consume' the <code>'\n'</code> character after you've read what you want.  Use the following format directive:</p>

<pre><code>""%[^\n]%*c""
</code></pre>

<p>Which will read everything up to the newline into the string you pass in, then will consume a single character (the newline) without assigning it to anything (that <code>'*'</code> is 'assignment suppression').</p>

<p>Otherwise,the newline is left in the input stream waiting to immediately terminate the the subsequent <code>""%[^\n]""</code> format directives.</p>

<p>The problem with adding a space character to the format directive (<code>"" %[^\n]""</code>) is that the space will match <em>any</em> white space. So, it will eat the newline from the end of the previous input, but it will also eat any other whitespace (including multiple newlines).</p>

<p>Update to your example:</p>

<pre><code>  char* fmt = ""%[^\n]%*c"";

  printf (""\nEnter str1: "");

<li><p>Can one instruct <code>fprintf</code> to write numbers at a desired numerical precision <strong>to a file</strong>? If I'm using <code>long double</code> then I assume that my answers are good till 15 digits after the decimal point. Am I right?  </p></li>
</ol>
","<p><code>fopen_s</code> is a variant of <code>fopen</code> which contains parameter validation and hands back an error code instead of a pointer in case something goes wrong during the open process. It's more secure than the base variant because it accounts for more edge conditions. The compiler is warning you to use it because <code>fopen</code> represents a potential exploitation vector in your application.</p>

<p>You can specify digits of precision to the <code>printf</code> family of functions by using the specifier <code>%.xg</code>, where <strong>x</strong> is the digits of precision you want in the output. A <code>long double</code> varies in precision from platform to platform, but you can generally bet on it being at least 16 digits of decimal precision.</p>

<p>Edit: While I'm not entirely on board with the others who are suggesting that <code>fopen_s</code> is a <em>complete</em> waste of time, it does represent a pretty low chance of exploitation and it isn't widely supported. Some of the other functions warned about under C4996 are much more serious vulnerabilities, however, and using <code>_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS</code> is the equivalent of turning off the alarm for both ""you left your bedroom door unlocked"" and ""you left a nuclear bomb in the kitchen"". </p>

<p>As long as you aren't restricted to using ""pure C"" for your project (e.g. for a school assignment or an embedded microcontroller), you would do well to exploit the fact that almost all modern C compilers are also C++ compilers and use the C++ <code>iostream</code> variants of all of these I/O functions in order to get both improved security <em>and</em> compatibility at the same time.</p>

"How to convert integers to characters in C?","75393","","<p>For example, if the integer was 97, the character would be 'a', or 98 to 'b'.</p>
","<p>In C, <code>int</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>long</code>, etc. are all <em>integers</em>.</p>

<p>They typically have different memory sizes and thus different ranges as in <code>INT_MIN</code> to <code>INT_MAX</code>.  <code>char</code> and arrays of <code>char</code> are often used to store characters and strings.  Integers are stored in many types: <code>int</code> being the most popular for a balance of speed, size and range.</p>

<p>ASCII is by far the most popular character encoding, but others exist.  The ASCII code for an 'A' is 65, 'a' is 97, '\n' is 10, etc.  ASCII data is most often stored in a <code>char</code> variable.  If the C environment is using ASCII encoding, the following all store the same value into the integer variable.</p>

<pre><code>int i1 = 'a';
int i2 = 97;
char c1 = 'a';
char c2 = 97;
</code></pre>

<p>To convert an <code>int</code> to a <code>char</code>, simple assign:</p>

<pre><code>int i3 = 'b';
int i4 = i3;
char c3;
char c4;
c3 = i3;
// To avoid a potential compiler warning, use a cast `char`.
c4 = (char) i4; 
</code></pre>

<p>This warning comes up because <code>int</code> typically has a greater range than <code>char</code> and so some loss-of-information may occur.  By using the cast <code>(char)</code>, the potential loss of info is explicitly directed.</p>

<p>To print the value of an integer:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""&lt;%c&gt;\n"", c3); // prints &lt;b&gt;

// Printing a `char` as an integer is less common but do-able
printf(""&lt;%d&gt;\n"", c3); // prints &lt;98&gt;

// Printing an `int` as a character is less common but do-able.
// The value is converted to an `unsigned char` and then printed.
printf(""&lt;%c&gt;\n"", i3); // prints &lt;b&gt;

printf(""&lt;%d&gt;\n"", i3); // prints &lt;98&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are additional issues about printing such as using <code>%hhu</code> or casting when printing an <code>unsigned char</code>, but leave that for later.  There is a lot to <code>printf()</code>.</p>

<p>While I'm a web developer, please don't let that limit your answer.  I'm 30...I've got years of career changing ahead of me.</p>
","<p>Both C and C++ give you a lower level of abstraction that, with increased complexity, provides a breadth of access to underlying machine functionality that are not necessarily exposed with other languages.  C++ adds the convenience (reduced development time) of a fully object oriented language which can, potentially, add an additional performance cost.  In terms of real world applications, I see these languages applied in the following domains:</p>

<p>C</p>

<ul>
<li>Kernel level software.</li>
<li>Hardware device drivers</li>
<li>Applications where access to old, stable code is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>C,C++</p>

<ul>
<li>Application or Server development where memory management needs to be fine tuned (and can't be left to generic garbage collection solutions).</li>
<li>Development environments that require access to libraries that do not interface well with more modern managed languages.</li>
<li>Although managed C++ can be used to access the .NET framework, it is not a seamless transition.</li>
</ul>

<p>C# provides a managed memory model that adds a higher level of abstraction again.  This level of abstraction adds convenience and improves development times, but complicates access to lower level APIs and makes specialized performance requirements problematic. </p>

<p>It is certainly possible to implement extremely high performance software in a managed memory environment, but awareness of the implications is essential.  </p>

<p>The syntax of C# is certainly less demanding (and error prone) than C/C++ and has, for the initiated programmer, a shallower learning curve.</p>

<p>C#</p>

<ul>
<li>Rapid client application development.</li>
<li>High performance Server development (StackOverflow for example) that benefits from the .NET framework.</li>
<li>Applications that require the benefits of the .NET framework in the language it was designed for.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/73070/johannes-r246ssel"">Johannes Rössel</a> makes the valid point that the use C# Pointers, Unsafe and Unchecked keywords break through the layer of abstraction upon which C# is built.

<p>I mean <em>int varGlobal=7;</em> is same as <em>static int varGlobal=7;</em> and if it's static then it can be used only in the file it was declared, right?</p>
","<p>Global variables are not <code>extern</code> nor <code>static</code> by default on C and C++.
When you declare a variable as <code>static</code>, you are restricting it to the current source file. If you declare it as <code>extern</code>, you are saying that the variable exists, but are declared somewhere else, and if you don't have it declared elsewhere (without the <code>extern</code> keyword) you will get a link error (symbol not found).</p>

<p>Your code will break when you have more source files including that header, on link time you will have multiple references to <code>varGlobal</code>. If you declare it as <code>static</code>, then it will work with multiple sources (I mean, it will compile and link), but each source will have its own <code>varGlobal</code>.</p>

<p>What you can do in C++, that you can't in C, is to declare the variable as <code>const</code> on the header, like this:</p>

<pre><code>const int varGlobal = 7;
</code></pre>

<p>And include in multiple sources, without breaking things at link time. The idea is to replace the old C style <code>#define</code> for constants.</p>

<p>If you need a global variable visible on multiple sources and not <code>const</code>, declare it as <code>extern</code> on the header, and declare it again, this time without the extern keywork, on a source file:</p>

<p>Header included by multiple files:</p>

<p>To fix that you can make <code>str</code> a local array:</p>

<pre><code>char str[] = ""First string"";

<p>Now, you will have a second problem, is that <code>str</code> isn't large enough to hold <code>str2</code>. So you will need to increase the length of it. Otherwise, you will overrun <code>str</code> - which is also undefined behavior.</p>

<p>I know it's a lot of questions in one, but I would greatly appreciate any responses.</p>
","<p>The answers to these questions vary depending on whether you are using a stream socket (<code>SOCK_STREAM</code>) or a datagram socket (<code>SOCK_DGRAM</code>) - within TCP/IP, the former corresponds to TCP and the latter to UDP.</p>

<p><em>How do you know how big to make the buffer passed to <code>recv()</code>?</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>SOCK_STREAM</code>: It doesn't really matter too much.  If your protocol is a transactional / interactive one just pick a size that can hold the largest individual message / command you would reasonably expect (3000 is likely fine).  If your protocol is transferring bulk data, then larger buffers can be more efficient - a good rule of thumb is around the same as the kernel receive buffer size of the socket (often something around 256kB).</p></li>
<li><p><code>SOCK_DGRAM</code>: Use a buffer large enough to hold the biggest packet that your application-level protocol ever sends.  If you're using UDP, then in general your application-level protocol shouldn't be sending packets larger than about 1400 bytes, because they'll certainly need to be fragmented and reassembled.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>What happens if <code>recv</code> gets a packet larger than the buffer?</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>SOCK_STREAM</code>: The question doesn't really make sense as put, because stream sockets don't have a concept of packets - they're just a continuous stream of bytes.  If there's more bytes available to read than your buffer has room for, then they'll be queued by the OS and available for your next call to <code>recv</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SOCK_DGRAM</code>: The excess bytes are discarded.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>How can I know if I have received the entire message?</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>SOCK_STREAM</code>: You need to build some way of determining the end-of-message into your application-level protocol.  Commonly this is either a length prefix (starting each message with the length of the message) or an end-of-message delimiter (which might just be a newline in a text-based protocol, for example).  A third, lesser-used, option is to mandate a fixed size for each message.  Combinations of these options are also possible - for example, a fixed-size header that includes a length value.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SOCK_DGRAM</code>: An single <code>recv</code> call always returns a single datagram.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is there a way I can make a buffer not have a fixed amount of space, so that I can keep adding to it without fear of running out of space?</em></p>

<p>No.  However, you can try to resize the buffer using <code>realloc()</code> (if it was originally allocated with <code>malloc()</code> or <code>calloc()</code>, that is).</p>

","<p>Getting the type of a variable is, as of now, possible in C11 with the <code>_Generic</code> generic selection. It works at compile-time.</p>

<p>The syntaxis is a bit like <code>switch</code>. Here's a sample (from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/17290414/3079266"">this answer</a>):</p>

<p>And then use <code>_Generic</code> to match types to this <code>enum</code>:</p>

"Should I use char** argv or char* argv[] in C?","74661","","<p>I'm just learning C and was wondering which one of these I should use in my main method. Is there any difference?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> So which one is more common to use?</p>
","<p>As you are just learning C, i recommend you to really try to understand the <em>differences</em> between arrays and pointers first instead of the <em>common</em> things. </p>

<p>In the area of parameters and arrays, there are a few confusing rules that should be clear before going on. First, <strong>what you declare in a parameter list is treated special.</strong> There are such situations where things don't make sense as a function parameter in C. These are</p>

<ul>
<li>Functions as parameters</li>
<li>Arrays as parameters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arrays as parameters </h2>

<p>The second maybe is not immediately clear. But it becomes clear when you consider that the size of an array dimension is part of the type in C (and an array whose dimension size isn't given has an incomplete type). So, if you would create a function that takes an array by-value (receives a copy), then it could do so only for one size! In addition, arrays can become large, and C tries to be as fast as possible. </p>

<p>In C, for these reasons, <strong>array-values</strong> are not existent. If you want to get the value of an array, what you get instead is a pointer to the first element of that array. And herein actually already lies the solution. Instead of drawing an array parameter invalid up-front, a C compiler will <strong>transform</strong> the type of the respective parameter to be a pointer. Remember this, it's very important. The parameter won't be an array, but instead it will be a pointer to the respective element type. </p>

<p>Now, if you try to pass an array, what is passed instead is a pointer to the arrays' first element. </p>

<h3>Excursion: Functions as parameters</h3>

<p>For completion, and because i think this will help you better understand the matter, let's look what the state of affairs is when you try to have a function as a parameter. Indeed, first it won't make any sense. How can a parameter be a function? Huh, we want a variable at that place, of course! So what the compiler does when that happens is, again, to <strong>transform</strong> the function into a <strong>function pointer</strong>. Trying to pass a function will pass a pointer to that respective function instead. So, the following are the same (analogous to the array example):</p>

<pre><code>void f(void g(void));
void f(void (*g)(void));
</code></pre>

<p>Note that parentheses around <code>*g</code> is needed. Otherwise, it would specify a function returning <code>void*</code>, instead of a pointer to a function returning <code>void</code>.</p>

<h2>Back to arrays</h2>

<p>Now, i said at the beginning that arrays can have an incomplete type - which happens if you don't give a size yet. Since we already figured that an array parameter is not existant but instead any array parameter is a pointer, the array's size doesn't matter. That means, the compiler will translate all of the following, and all are the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int c, char **argv);
int main(int c, char *argv[]);
int main(int c, char *argv[1]);
int main(int c, char *argv[42]);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, it doesn't make much sense to be able to put any size in it, and it's just thrown away. For that reason, C99 came up with a new meaning for those numbers, and allows other things to appear between the brackets:</p>

<pre><code>// says: argv is a non-null pointer pointing to at least 5 char*'s
// allows CPU to pre-load some memory. 
int main(int c, char *argv[static 5]);

// says: argv is a constant pointer pointing to a char*
int main(int c, char *argv[const]);

// says the same as the previous one
int main(int c, char ** const argv);
</code></pre>

<p>The last two lines say that you won't be able to change ""argv"" within the function - it has become a const pointer. Only few C compilers support those C99 features though. But these features make it clear that the ""array"" isn't actually one. It's a pointer. </p>

<h2>A word of Warning</h2>

<p>Note that all i said above is true only when you have got an array as a <strong>parameter</strong> of a function. If you work with local arrays, an array won't be a pointer. It will <em>behave</em> as a pointer, because as explained earlier an array will be converted to a pointer when its value is read. But it should not be confused with pointers. </p>

<p>One classic example is the following:</p>

<pre><code>char c[10]; 
char **c = &amp;c; // does not work.

typedef char array[10];
array *pc = &amp;c; // *does* work.

// same without typedef. Parens needed, because [...] has 
// higher precedence than '*'. Analogous to the function example above.
char (*array)[10] = &amp;c;

<p>The most compiler-friendly way to express a rotate in C and C++ that avoids any Undefined Behaviour seems to be <a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1063"" rel=""noreferrer"">John Regehr's implementation</a>.  I've adapted it to rotate by the width of the type (e.g. assuming that <code>uint32_t</code> is exactly 32 bits wide, although C/C++ only guarantees that it's <em>at least</em> that wide.  I tried to keep it readable by leaving out checks for that kind of thing).</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;   // for uint32_t
#include &lt;limits.h&gt;   // for CHAR_BIT
// #define NDEBUG
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;

static inline uint32_t rotl32 (uint32_t n, unsigned int c)
{
  const unsigned int mask = (CHAR_BIT*sizeof(n) - 1);  // assumes width is a power of 2.

  // assert ( (c&lt;=mask) &amp;&amp;""rotate by type width or more"");
  c &amp;= mask;
  return (n&lt;&lt;c) | (n&gt;&gt;( (-c)&amp;mask ));
}

static inline uint32_t rotr32 (uint32_t n, unsigned int c)
{
  const unsigned int mask = (CHAR_BIT*sizeof(n) - 1);

  // assert ( (c&lt;=mask) &amp;&amp;""rotate by type width or more"");
  c &amp;= mask;
  return (n&gt;&gt;c) | (n&lt;&lt;( (-c)&amp;mask ));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Works for any unsigned integer type, not just <code>uint32_t</code>, so you could make versions for other sizes.</p>

<p><strong>See <a href=""https://gist.github.com/pabigot/7550454"" rel=""noreferrer"">also a C++11 template version</a> with lots of safety checks (including a <code>static_assert</code> that the type width is a power of 2)</strong>, which isn't the case on some 24-bit DSPs or 36-bit mainframes, for example.</p>

<p>I'd recommend only using the template as a back-end for wrappers with names that include the rotate width explicitly.  <strong>Integer-promotion rules mean that <code>rotl_template(u16 &amp; 0x11UL, 7)</code> would do a 32 or 64-bit rotate, not 16</strong> (depending on the width of <code>unsigned long</code>).

<p>Compiler support for this UB-avoiding idiom on x86, for <code>uint32_t x</code> and <code>unsigned int n</code> for variable-count shifts:</p>

<ul>
<li>clang: recognized for variable-count rotates since clang3.5, multiple shifts+or insns before that.</li>
<li>gcc: <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57157"" rel=""noreferrer"">recognized  for variable-count rotates since gcc4.9</a>, multiple shifts+or insns before that.  gcc5 and later optimize away the branch and mask in the wikipedia version, too, using just a <code>ror</code> or <code>rol</code> instruction for variable counts.</li>
<li>icc: <a href=""https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-c-compilers-in-inde/topic/580884"" rel=""noreferrer"">supported for variable-count rotates since ICC13 or earlier</a>.  Constant-count rotates use <code>shld edi,edi,7</code> which is slower and takes more bytes than <code>rol edi,7</code> on some CPUs (especially AMD, but also some Intel), when BMI2 isn't available for <code>rorx eax,edi,25</code> to save a MOV.</li>
<li>MSVC: x86-64 CL19: Only recognized for constant-count rotates.  (The wikipedia idiom is recognized, but the branch and AND aren't optimized away).  Use the <code>_rotl</code> / <code>_rotr</code> intrinsics from <code>&lt;intrin.h&gt;</code> on x86 (including x86-64).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>gcc for ARM uses an <code>and r1, r1, #31</code> for variable-count rotates, but still does the actual rotate with a single instruction</strong>: <code>ror r0, r0, r1</code>.  So gcc doesn't realize that rotate-counts are inherently modular.  As the ARM docs say, <a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0552a/BABFFEJF.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">""ROR with shift length, <code>n</code>, more than 32 is the same as ROR with shift length <code>n-32</code>""</a>.  I think gcc gets confused here because left/right shifts on ARM saturate the count, so a shift by 32 or more will clear the register.  (Unlike x86, where shifts mask the count the same as rotates).  It probably decides it needs an AND instruction before recognizing the rotate idiom, because of how non-circular shifts work on that target.</p>

<p>Current x86 compilers still use an extra instruction to mask a variable count for 8 and 16-bit rotates, probably for the same reason they don't avoid the AND on ARM.  This is a missed optimization, because performance doesn't depend on the rotate count on any x86-64 CPU.  (Masking of counts was introduced with 286 for performance reasons because it handled shifts iteratively, not with constant-latency like modern CPUs.)</p>

<p>BTW, prefer rotate-right for variable-count rotates, to avoid making the compiler do <code>32-n</code> to implement a left rotate on architectures like ARM and MIPS that only provide a rotate-right.  (This optimizes away with compile-time-constant counts.)</p>

<p>Fun fact: ARM doesn't really have dedicated shift/rotate instructions, it's just MOV with the <a href=""https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi14/cse30-c/lectures/PI_WI_14_CSE30_lecture_8_post.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">source operand going through the barrel-shifter in ROR mode</a>: <code>mov r0, r0, ror r1</code>.  So a rotate can fold into a register-source operand for an EOR instruction or something.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Make sure you use unsigned types for <code>n</code> and the return value, or else it won't be a rotate</strong>.  (gcc for x86 targets does arithmetic right shifts, shifting in copies of the sign-bit rather than zeroes, leading to a problem when you <code>OR</code> the two shifted values together.  Right-shifts of negative signed integers is implementation-defined behaviour in C.)</p>

<p>Also, <strong>make sure the shift count is an unsigned type</strong>, because <code>(-n)&amp;31</code> with a signed type could be one's complement or sign/magnitude, and not the same as the modular 2^n you get with unsigned or two's complement.  (See comments on Regehr's blog post).  <code>unsigned int</code> does well on every compiler I've looked at, for every width of <code>x</code>.  Some other types actually defeat the idiom-recognition for some compilers, so don't just use the same type as <code>x</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Some compilers provide intrinsics for rotates</strong>, which is far better than inline-asm if the portable version doesn't generate good code on the compiler you're targeting.  There aren't cross-platform intrinsics for any compilers that I know of.  These are some of the x86 options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel documents that <a href=""https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#techs=SSE,SSE2,SSE3,SSSE3,SSE4_1,SSE4_2,AVX,AVX2,FMA,Other&amp;expand=3236,3233,5453,5453,5534,1649,5169,4433,4431&amp;text=rotl"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>&lt;immintrin.h&gt;</code> provides <code>_rotl</code> and <code>_rotl64</code> intrinsics</a>, and same for right shift.  MSVC requires <code>&lt;intrin.h&gt;</code>, while gcc require <code>&lt;x86intrin.h&gt;</code>.  An <code>#ifdef</code> takes care of gcc vs. icc, but clang doesn't seem to provide them anywhere, <a href=""http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-commits/Week-of-Mon-20160905/170179.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">except in MSVC compatibility mode with <code>-fms-extensions -fms-compatibility -fms-compatibility-version=17.00</code></a>.  And the asm it emits for them sucks (extra masking and a CMOV).</li>
<li>MSVC: <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yy0728bz(v=vs.140).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>_rotr8</code> and <code>_rotr16</code></a>.</li>
<li>gcc and icc (not clang):  <code>&lt;x86intrin.h&gt;</code> also provides <code>__rolb</code>/<code>__rorb</code> for 8-bit rotate left/right, <code>__rolw</code>/<code>__rorw</code> (16-bit),  <code>__rold</code>/<code>__rord</code> (32-bit), <code>__rolq</code>/<code>__rorq</code> (64-bit, only defined for 64-bit targets).  For narrow rotates, the implementation uses <code>__builtin_ia32_rolhi</code> or <code>...qi</code>, but the 32 and 64-bit rotates are defined using shift/or (with no protection against UB, because the code in <a href=""https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/config/i386/ia32intrin.h#L146"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ia32intrin.h</code></a> only has to work on gcc for x86).  GNU C appears not to have any cross-platform <code>__builtin_rotate</code> functions the way it does for <code>__builtin_popcount</code> (which expands to whatever's optimal on the target platform, even if it's not a single instruction).  Most of the time you get good code from idiom-recognition.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the following is syntactically correct</p>

<pre><code>if(a==1)
{

<p>Why is this?</p>
","<p>This is actually a fairly interesting question.  It's not as simple as it looks at first.  For reference, I'm going to be basing this off of the latest C11 language grammar defined in <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf"">N1570</a></p>

<p>I guess the counter-intuitive part of the question is: if this is correct C:</p>

<pre><code>if (a == 1) {
  int b = 10;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then why is this not also correct C?</p>

<pre><code>if (a == 1)
  int b = 10;
</code></pre>

<p>I mean, a one-line conditional <code>if</code> statement should be fine either with or without braces, right?</p>

<p>The answer lies in the grammar of the <code>if</code> statement, as defined by the C standard.  The relevant parts of the grammar I've quoted below.  Succinctly: the <code>int b = 10</code> line is a <em>declaration</em>, not a <em>statement</em>, and the grammar for the <code>if</code> statement requires a statement after the conditional that it's testing.  But if you enclose the declaration in braces, it becomes a statement and everything's well.</p>

<p>And just for the sake of answering the question completely -- this has nothing to do with scope.  The <code>b</code> variable that exists inside that scope will be inaccessible from outside of it, but the program is still syntactically correct.  Strictly speaking, the compiler shouldn't throw an error on it.  Of course, you should be building with <code>-Wall -Werror</code> anyways ;-)</p>

","<p>There are several ways to solve your problem, each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>First I'd like to note that you already got quite a few of responses that do the following: they generate a random number, then check somehow whether it was already used in the array, and if it was already used, they just generate another number until they find an unused one.
This is a naive and, truth to be said, seriously flawed approach. The problem is with the cyclic trial-and-error nature of the number generation (""if already used, try again""). If the numeric range (say, [1..N]) is close to the length of the desired array (say, M), then towards the end the algorithm might spend a huge amount of time trying to find the next number. If the random number generator is even a little bit broken (say, never generates some number, or does it very rarely), then with N == M the algorithm is guaranteed to loop forever (or for a very long time). Generally this trial-and-error approach is a useless one, or a flawed one at best.</p>

<p>Another approach already presented here is generating a random permutation in an array of size N. The idea of random permutation is a promising one, but doing it on an array of size N (when M &lt;&lt; N) will certainly generate more heat than light, speaking figuratively.</p>

<p>Good solutions to this problem can be found, for example, in Bentley's ""Programming Pearls"" (and some of them are taken from Knuth).</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Knuth algorithm.</strong> This is a very simple algorithm with a complexity of O(N) (i.e. the numeric range), meaning that it is most usable when M is close to N. However, this algorithm doesn't require any extra memory in addition to your <code>vektor</code> array, as opposed to already offered variant with permutations (meaning that it takes O(M) memory, not O(N) as other permutation-based algorithms suggested here). The latter makes it a viable algorithm even for M &lt;&lt; N cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>The algorithm works as follows: iterate through all numbers from 1 to N and select the current number with probability <code>rm / rn</code>, where <code>rm</code> is how many numbers we still need to find, and <code>rn</code> is how many numbers we still need to iterate through. Here's a possible implementation for your case</p>

<pre><code>#define M 10
#define N 100

int in, im;

im = 0;

for (in = 0; in &lt; N &amp;&amp; im &lt; M; ++in) {
  int rn = N - in;
  int rm = M - im;
  if (rand() % rn &lt; rm)    
    /* Take it */
    vektor[im++] = in + 1; /* +1 since your range begins from 1 */
}

assert(im == M);
</code></pre>

<p>After this cycle we get an array <code>vektor</code> filled with randomly chosen numbers <em>in ascending order</em>. The ""ascending order"" bit is what we don't need here. So, in order to ""fix"" that we just make a random permutation of elements of <code>vektor</code> and we are done. Note, that the this is a O(M) permutation requiring no extra memory. (I leave out the implementation of the permutation algorithm. Plenty of links was given here already.).</p>

<p>If you look carefully at the permutation-based algorithms proposed here that operate on an array of length N, you'll see that most of them are pretty much this very same Knuth algorithm, but re-formulated for <code>M == N</code>. In that case the above selection cycle will chose each and every number in [1..N] range with probabilty 1, effectively turning into initialization of an N-array with numbers 1 to N. Taking this into account, I think it becomes rather obvious that running this algorithm for <code>M == N</code> and then truncating the result (possibly discarding most of it) makes much less sense than just running this algorithm in its original form for the original value of M and getting the result right away, without any truncation.</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Floyd algorithm</strong> (see <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=kse_7qbWbjsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22column%2013%22%20bentley%20%22programming%20pearls%22&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>). This approach has the complexity of about O(M) (depends on the search structure used), so it is better suitable when M &lt;&lt; N. This approach keeps track of already generated random numbers, so it requires extra memory. However, the beauty of it is that it <em>does not</em> make any of those abominable trial-and-error iterations, trying to find an unused random number. This algorithm is guaranteed to generate one unique random number after each call to the random number generator. </li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a possible implementation for it for your case. (There are different ways to keep track of already used numbers. I'll just use an array of flags, assuming that N is not prohibitively large)</p>

<pre><code>#define M 10
#define N 100    

unsigned char is_used[N] = { 0 }; /* flags */
int in, im;

im = 0;

for (in = N - M; in &lt; N &amp;&amp; im &lt; M; ++in) {
  int r = rand() % (in + 1); /* generate a random number 'r' */

  if (is_used[r])
    /* we already have 'r' */
    r = in; /* use 'in' instead of the generated number */

  assert(!is_used[r]);
  vektor[im++] = r + 1; /* +1 since your range begins from 1 */
  is_used[r] = 1;
}

assert(im == M);
</code></pre>

<p>Why the above works is not immediately obvious. But it works. Exactly M numbers from [1..N] range will be picked with uniform distribution.</p>

<p>Note, that for large N you can use a search-based structure to store ""already used"" numbers, thus getting a nice O(M log M) algorithm with O(M) memory requirement.</p>

<p>(There's one thing about this algorithm though: while the resultant array will not be ordered, a certain ""influence"" of the original 1..N ordering will still be present in the result. For example, it is obvious that number N, if selected, can only be the very last member of the resultant array. If this ""contamination"" of the result by the unintended ordering is not acceptable, the resultant <code>vektor</code> array can be random-shuffled, just like in the Khuth algorithm).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note the very critical point observed in the design of these two algoritms: they never <em>loop</em>, trying to find a new unused random number. Any algorithm that makes trial-and-error iterations with random numbers is flawed from practical point of view. Also, the memory consumption of these algorithms is tied to M, not to N</strong></p>

<p>To the OP I would recommend the Floyd's algorithm, since in his application M seems to be considerably less than N and that it doesn't (or may not) require an extra pass for permutation. However, for such small values of N the difference might be negligible.</p>

#endif 
</code></pre>
","<p>Since this answer still gets voted up, I want to point out that you should almost never need to look in the header files. If you want to write reliable code, you're much better served by looking in the standard. A better question than ""how is <code>off_t</code> defined on my machine""  is ""how is <code>off_t</code> defined by the standard?"". Following the standard means that your code will work today and tomorrow, on any machine.</p>

<p>In this case, <code>off_t</code> isn't defined by the C standard. It's part of the POSIX standard, which <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/"" rel=""noreferrer"">you can browse here</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>off_t</code> isn't very rigorously defined. All I could find to define it is on the page on <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_types.h.html#tag_13_67"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>sys/types.h</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>blkcnt_t</code> and <code>off_t</code> shall be signed integer types.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that you can't be sure how big it is. If you're using GNU C, you can use the instructions in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/14351239/790070"">the answer below</a> to ensure that it's 64 bits. Or better, you can convert to a standards defined size before putting it on the wire. This is how projects like Google's <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Protocol Buffers</a> work (although that is a C++ project).</p>

<hr>

<p>So, I think ""where do I find the definition in my header files"" isn't the best question. 
But, for completeness here's the answer:</p>

<p>You'll find the definition in <code>bits/types.h</code> (as a comment says at the top, never directly include this file),  but it's obscured a bit in a bunch of macros. An alternative to trying to unravel them is to look at the preprocessor output:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

int main(void) {
  off_t blah;

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then:    </p>

<pre><code>$ gcc -E sizes.c  | grep __off_t
typedef long int __off_t;
....
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you want to know the size of something, you can always use the <code>sizeof()</code> operator.</p>

<p>Edit: Just saw the part of your question about the <code>__</code>. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1449301/790070"">This answer has a good discussion</a>. The key point is that names starting with <code>__</code> are reserved for the implementation (so you shouldn't start your own definitions with <code>__</code>).</p>

"Why use apparently meaningless do-while and if-else statements in macros?","74105","","<p>In many C/C++ macros I'm seeing the code of the macro wrapped in what seems like a meaningless <code>do while</code> loop.  Here are examples.</p>

#define FOO(X) if (1) { f(X); g(X); } else

<p>I can't see what the <code>do while</code> is doing.  Why not just write this without it?</p>

<pre><code>#define FOO(X) f(X); g(X)

","<p>The <code>do ... while</code> and <code>if ... else</code> are there to make it so that a
semicolon after your macro always means the same thing.  Let's say you
had something like your second macro.</p>

<pre><code>#define BAR(X) f(x); g(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you were to use <code>BAR(X);</code> in an <code>if ... else</code> statement, where the bodies of the if statement were not wrapped in curly brackets, you'd get a bad surprise.</p>

<pre><code>if (corge)
  BAR(corge);
else
  gralt();
</code></pre>

<p>The above code would expand into</p>

<pre><code>if (corge)
  f(corge); g(corge);
else
  gralt();
</code></pre>

<p>which is syntactically incorrect, as the else is no longer associated with the if.  It doesn't help to wrap things in curly braces within the macro, because a semicolon after the braces is syntactically incorrect.</p>

<pre><code>if (corge)
  {f(corge); g(corge);};
else
  gralt();
</code></pre>

<p>There are two ways of fixing the problem.  The first is to use a comma to sequence statements within the macro without robbing it of its ability to act like an expression.</p>

<pre><code>#define BAR(X) f(X), g(X)
</code></pre>

<p>The above version of bar <code>BAR</code> expands the above code into what follows, which is syntactically correct.</p>

<pre><code>if (corge)
  f(corge), g(corge);
else
  gralt();
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work if instead of <code>f(X)</code> you have a more complicated body of code that needs to go in its own block, say for example to declare local variables.  In the most general case the solution is to use something like <code>do ... while</code> to cause the macro to be a single statement that takes a semicolon without confusion.</p>

<pre><code>#define BAR(X) do { \
  int i = f(X); \
  if (i &gt; 4) g(i); \
} while (0)
</code></pre>

<p>You don't have to use <code>do ... while</code>, you could cook up something with <code>if ... else</code> as well, although when <code>if ... else</code> expands inside of an <code>if ... else</code> it leads to a ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else"" rel=""noreferrer"">dangling else</a>"", which could make an existing dangling else problem even harder to find, as in the following code.</p>

<pre><code>if (corge)
  if (1) { f(corge); g(corge); } else;
else
  gralt();
</code></pre>

<p>The point is to use up the semicolon in contexts where a dangling semicolon is erroneous.  Of course, it could (and probably should) be argued at this point that it would be better to declare <code>BAR</code> as an actual function, not a macro.</p>

<p>In summary, the <code>do ... while</code> is there to work around the shortcomings of the C preprocessor.  When those C style guides tell you to lay off the C preprocessor, this is the kind of thing they're worried about.</p>

<li><a href=""http://bytes.com/topic/c/answers/800137-dereferencing-type-punned-pointer-will-break-strict-aliasing-rules"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Concluding: there's no need to worry; gcc tries to be more law obedient than

<p>vs</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/98650/what-is-the-strict-aliasing-rule/98702#98702"">So basically if you have an int* and a float* they are not allowed to point to the same memory location. If your code does not respect this, then the compiler's optimizer will most likely break your code.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the end I don't want to ignore the warnings. What would you recommend?</p>

<p><strong>[update]</strong> I substituted the toy example with the real function.</p>
","<p>It looks a lot as if you really want to use fread:</p>

<pre><code>int data;
fread(&amp;data, sizeof(data), 1, stream);
</code></pre>

<p>That said, if you do want to go the route of reading chars, then reinterpreting them as an int, the safe way to do it in C (but <strong>not</strong> in C++) is to use a union:</p>

<pre><code>union
{
    char theChars[4];
    int theInt;
} myunion;

for(int i=0; i&lt;4; i++)
    myunion.theChars[i] = fgetc(stream);
return myunion.theInt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why the length of <code>data</code> in your original code is 3. I assume you wanted 4 bytes; at least I don't know of any systems where an int is 3 bytes.</p>

<p>Note that both your code and mine are highly non-portable.</p>

<p>Edit: If you want to read ints of various lengths from a file, portably, try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned result=0;
for(int i=0; i&lt;4; i++)
    result = (result &lt;&lt; 8) | fgetc(stream);
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: In a real program, you would additionally want to test the return value of fgetc() against EOF.)</p>

<p>This reads a 4-byte unsigned from the file in little-endian format, <em>regardless</em> of what the endianness of the system is. It should work on just about any system where an unsigned is at least 4 bytes.</p>

<p>If you want to be endian-neutral, don't use pointers or unions; use bit-shifts instead.</p>

Now I am facing question how to extend it to compute integral, which will be given as an extra parameter when starting and app. Does anyone knows how to deal with such a parameter in a program? Thanks</p>
","<p>When you write your main function, you typically seen one of two definitions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>int main(void)</code></li>
<li><code>int main(int argc, char **argv)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The second form will allow you to access the command line arguments passed to the program, and the number of arguments specified (arguments are separated by spaces).</p>

<p>The arguments to <code>main</code> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>int argc</code> - the number of arguments passed into your program when it was run. It is at least <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><code>char **argv</code> - this is a pointer-to-<code>char *</code>. It can alternatively be this: <code>char *argv[]</code>, which means 'array of <code>char *</code>'. This is an array of C-style-string pointers.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Basic Example</h3>

<p>For example, you could do this to print out the arguments passed to your C program:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; argc; ++i)
    {
        printf(""argv[%d]: %s\n"", i, argv[i]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using GCC 4.5 to compile this, it's a file I called <code>args.c</code>. It'll compile and build a default <code>a.out</code> executable.</p>

<pre><code>[birryree@lilun c_code]$ gcc -std=c99 args.c
</code></pre>

<p>Now run it...</p>

<pre><code>[birryree@lilun c_code]$ ./a.out hello there
argv[0]: ./a.out
argv[1]: hello
argv[2]: there
</code></pre>

<p>So you can see that in <code>argv</code>, <code>argv[0]</code> is the name of the program you ran (this is not standards-defined behavior, but is common. Your arguments start at <code>argv[1]</code> and beyond.</p>

<p>So basically, if you wanted a single parameter, you could say...</p>

<p><code>./myprogram integral</code></p>

<hr>

<h3>A Simple Case for You</h3>

<p>And you could check if <code>argv[1]</code> was <code>integral</code>, maybe like <code>strcmp(""integral"", argv[1]) == 0</code>.</p>

<p>So in your code...</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    if (argc &lt; 2) // no arguments were passed
    {
        // do something
    }

    if (strcmp(""integral"", argv[1]) == 0)
    {
        runIntegral(...); //or something
    }
    else
    {
        // do something else.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>Better command line parsing</h3>

<p>Of course, this was all very rudimentary, and as your program gets more complex, you'll likely want more advanced command line handling. For that, you could use a library like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getopt"" rel=""noreferrer"">GNU <code>getopt</code></a>.</p>

<p>That's it. What follows is a more involved explanation of why this works :)</p>

<p>I don't know how well you know C pointers, but array access in C (like <code>array[2]</code>) is actually a shorthand for accessing memory via a pointer. To access the memory pointed to by <code>data</code>, you write <code>*data</code>. This is known as dereferencing the pointer. Since <code>data</code> is of type <code>int *</code>, then <code>*data</code> is of type <code>int</code>. Now to an important piece of information: <code>(data + 2)</code> means ""add the byte size of 2 ints to the adress pointed to by <code>data</code>"".</p>

<p>An array in C is just a sequence of values in adjacent memory. <code>array[1]</code> is just next to <code>array[0]</code>. So when we allocate a big block of memory and want to use it as an array, we need an easy way of getting the direct adress to every element inside. Luckily, C lets us use the array notation on pointers as well. <code>data[0]</code> means the same thing as <code>*(data+0)</code>, namely ""access the memory pointed to by <code>data</code>"". <code>data[2]</code> means <code>*(data+2)</code>, and accesses the third <code>int</code> in the memory block.</p>

"Multiple conditions in a C 'for' loop","72788","","<p>I came across this piece of code. I generally use '&amp;&amp;' or '||' to separate multiple conditions in a <code>for</code> loop, but this code uses commas to do that.</p>

","<p>The algorithm is ray-casting to the right. Each iteration of the loop, the test point is checked against one of the polygon's edges. The first line of the if-test succeeds if the point's y-coord is within the edge's scope. The second line checks whether the test point is to the left of the line (I think - I haven't got any scrap paper to hand to check). If that is true the line drawn rightwards from the test point crosses that edge.</p>

<p>By repeatedly inverting the value of <code>c</code>, the algorithm counts how many times the rightward line crosses the polygon. If it crosses an odd number of times, then the point is inside; if an even number, the point is outside.</p>

"How define an array of function pointers in C","72484","","<p>I've a little question.
I'm trying to define an array of function pointers dynamically with <code>calloc</code>. 
But I don't know how to write the syntax.
Thanks a lot.</p>
","<p>The type of a function pointer is just like the function declaration, but with ""(*)"" in place of the function name.  So a pointer to:</p>

<pre><code>int foo( int )
</code></pre>

<p>would be:</p>

<pre><code>int (*)( int )
</code></pre>

<p>In order to name an instance of this type, put the name inside (*), after the star, so:</p>

<pre><code>int (*foo_ptr)( int )
</code></pre>

<p>declares a variable called foo_ptr that points to a function of this type.</p>

<p>Arrays follow the normal C syntax of putting the brackets near the variable's identifier, so:</p>

<pre><code>int (*foo_ptr_array[2])( int )
</code></pre>

<p>declares a variable called foo_ptr_array which is an array of 2 function pointers.</p>

<p>The syntax can get pretty messy, so it's often easier to make a typedef to the function pointer and then declare an array of those instead:</p>

<pre><code>typedef int (*foo_ptr_t)( int );
foo_ptr_t foo_ptr_array[2];
</code></pre>

<p>In either sample you can do things like:</p>

<pre><code>int f1( int );
int f2( int );
foo_ptr_array[0] = f1;
foo_ptr_array[1] = f2;
foo_ptr_array[0]( 1 );
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you can dynamically allocate an array with either of:</p>

<pre><code>int (**a1)( int ) = calloc( 2, sizeof( int (*)( int ) ) );
foo_ptr_t * a2 = calloc( 2, sizeof( foo_ptr_t ) );
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the extra * in the first line to declare a1 as a pointer to the function pointer.</p>

/* Declare the functions */

/* Calculate the volume of a sphere from a given radius */
double volumeFromRadius(double radius) {

","<p>You need to link with the math library:</p>

<p>The error you are seeing: <code>error: ld returned 1 exit status</code> is from the linker <code>ld</code> (part of gcc that combines the object files) because it is unable to find where the function <code>pow</code> is defined.</p>

"Error handling in C code","71594","","<p>What do you consider ""best practice"" when it comes to error handling errors in a consistent way in a C library.</p>

<p>There are two ways I've been thinking of:</p>

<p>Always return error code. A typical function would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>MYAPI_ERROR getObjectSize(MYAPIHandle h, int* returnedSize);
</code></pre>

<p>The always provide an error pointer approach:</p>

<pre><code>int getObjectSize(MYAPIHandle h, MYAPI_ERROR* returnedError);

<p>When using the first approach it's possible to write code like this where the error handling check is directly placed on the function call:</p>

<pre><code>int size;
if(getObjectSize(h, &amp;size) != MYAPI_SUCCESS) {
  // Error handling
}

}

<p>Also tell me how to delete a file in C or C++?</p>
","<p>You want to write a function (a recursive function is easiest, but can easily run out of stack space on deep directories) that will enumerate the children of a directory.  If you find a child that is a directory, you recurse on that.  Otherwise, you delete the files inside.  When you are done, the directory is empty and you can remove it via the syscall.</p>

<p>To enumerate directories on Unix, you can use <code>opendir</code>, <code>readdir</code>, and <code>closedir</code>.  To remove you use <code>rmdir()</code> on an empty directory (i.e. at the end of your function, after deleting the children) and <code>unlink()</code> on a file.  Note that on many systems the <code>d_type</code> member in <code>struct dirent</code> is not supported; on these platforms, you will have to use <code>stat()</code> and <code>S_ISDIR(stat.st_mode)</code> to determine if a given path is a directory.</p>

<p>On Windows, you will use <code>FindFirstFile()</code>/<code>FindNextFile()</code> to enumerate, <code>RemoveDirectory()</code> on empty directories, and <code>DeleteFile()</code> to remove files.</p>

"Must declare function prototype in C?","70914","","<p>I am kind of new to C (I have prior Java, C#, and some C++ experience). In C, is it necessary to declare a function prototype or can the code compile without it? Is it good programming practice to do so? Or does it just depend on the compiler? (I am running Ubuntu 9.10 and using the GNU C Compiler, or gcc, under the Code::Blocks IDE)</p>
","<p>In ANSI C (meaning C89 or C90), you do not have to declare a function prototype; however, it is a best practice to use them. The only reason the standard allows you to not use them is for backward compatibility with very old code.</p>

<p>If you do not have a prototype, and you call a function, the compiler will infer a prototype from the parameters you pass to the function. If you declare the function later in the same compilation unit, you'll get a compile error if the function's signature is different from what the compiler guessed. </p>

<p>Worse, if the function is in another compilation unit, there's no way to get a compilation error, since without a a prototype there's no way to check. In that case, if the compiler gets it wrong, you could get undefined behavior if the function call pushes different types on the stack than the function expects.</p>

<p>Convention is to always declare a prototype in a header file that has the same name as the source file containing the function.</p>

<p>In C99 or C11, standard C requires a function declaration in scope before you call any function.  Many compilers do not enforce this restriction in practice unless you force them to do so.</p>

<p>The output is still -12. I thought it should have printed out: 12, or am I misunderstanding something?</p>
","<p>The <code>-12</code> to the right of your equals sign is set up as a signed integer (probably 32 bits in size) and will have the hexadecimal value <code>0xFFFFFFF4</code>. The compiler generates code to move this signed integer into your unsigned integer <code>x</code> which is also a 32 bit entity. The compiler assumes you only have a positive value to the right of the equals sign so it simply moves all 32 bits into <code>x</code>. <code>x</code> now has the value <code>0xFFFFFFF4</code> which is <code>4294967284</code> if interpreted as a positive number. But the <code>printf</code> format of <code>%d</code> says the 32 bits are to be interpreted as a signed integer so you get <code>-12</code>. If you had used <code>%u</code> it would have printed as <code>4294967284</code>. </p>

<p>In either case you don't get what you expected since C language ""trusts"" the writer of code to only ask for ""sensible"" things. This is common in C. If you wanted to assign a value to <code>x</code> and were not sure whether the value on the right side of the equals was positive you could have written <code>unsigned int x = abs(-12);</code> and forced the compiler to generate code to take the absolute value of a signed integer before moving it to the unsigned integer.</p>

"C state-machine design","70633","","<p>I am crafting a small project in mixed C and C++.  I am building one small-ish state-machine at the heart of one of my worker thread.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you gurus on SO would share your state-machine design techniques.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am primarily after tried &amp; tested implementation techniques.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong> Based on all the great input gathered on SO, I've settled on this architecture:</p>

<p><img src=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1ja67dF2og9TnEwSXphc2o1OGM/preview"" alt=""alt text""></p>
","<p>State machines that I've designed before (C, not C++) have all come down to a <code>struct</code> array and a loop. The structure basically consists of a state and event (for look-up) and a function that returns the new state, something like:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
    int st;
    int ev;
    int (*fn)(void);
} tTransition;
</code></pre>

<p>Then you define your states and events with simple defines (the <code>ANY</code> ones are special markers, see below):</p>

<pre><code>#define ST_ANY              -1
#define ST_INIT              0
#define ST_ERROR             1
#define ST_TERM              2
: :
#define EV_ANY              -1
#define EV_KEYPRESS       5000
#define EV_MOUSEMOVE      5001
</code></pre>

<p>Then you define all the functions that are called by the transitions:</p>

<pre><code>static int GotKey (void) { ... };
static int FsmError (void) { ... };
</code></pre>

<p>All these function are written to take no variables and return the new state for the state machine. In this example global variables are used for passing any information into the state functions where necessary.</p>

<p>Using globals isn't as bad as it sounds since the FSM is usually locked up inside a single compilation unit and all variables are static to that unit (which is why I used quotes around ""global"" above - they're more shared within the FSM, than truly global). As with all globals, it requires care.</p>

<p>The transitions array then defines all possible transitions and the functions that get called for those transitions (including the catch-all last one):</p>

<pre><code>tTransition trans[] = {
    { ST_INIT, EV_KEYPRESS, &amp;GotKey},
    : :
    { ST_ANY, EV_ANY, &amp;FsmError}
};
#define TRANS_COUNT (sizeof(trans)/sizeof(*trans))
</code></pre>

<p>What that means is: if you're in the <code>ST_INIT</code> state and you receive the <code>EV_KEYPRESS</code> event, make a call to <code>GotKey</code>.</p>

<p>The workings of the FSM then become a relatively simple loop:</p>

<pre><code>state = ST_INIT;
while (state != ST_TERM) {
    event = GetNextEvent();
    for (i = 0; i &lt; TRANS_COUNT; i++) {
        if ((state == trans[i].st) || (ST_ANY == trans[i].st)) {
            if ((event == trans[i].ev) || (EV_ANY == trans[i].ev)) {
                state = (trans[i].fn)();
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As alluded to above, note the use of <code>ST_ANY</code> as wild-cards, allowing an event to call a function no matter the current state. <code>EV_ANY</code> also works similarly, allowing any event at a specific state to call a function.</p>

<p>It can also guarantee that, if you reach the end of the transitions array, you get an error stating your FSM hasn't been built correctly (by using the <code>ST_ANY/EV_ANY</code> combination.</p>

<p>I've used code similar for this on a great many communications projects, such as an early implementation of communications stacks and protocols for embedded systems. The big advantage was its simplicity and relative ease in changing the transitions array.</p>

<p>I've no doubt there will be higher-level abstractions which may be more suitable nowadays but I suspect they'll all boil down to this same sort of structure. </p>

<hr>

<p>And, as <code>ldog</code> states in a comment, you can avoid the globals altogether by passing a structure pointer to all functions (and using that in the event loop). This will allow multiple state machines to run side-by-side without interference.</p>

<p>Just create a structure type which holds the machine-specific data (state at a bare minimum) and use that instead of the globals.</p>

<p>The reason I've rarely done that is simply because most of the state machines I've written have been singleton types (one-off, at-process-start, configuration file reading for example), not needing to run more than one instance. But it has value if you need to run more than one.</p>

  <li>How can I tell if a number is really a number and not a NaN or an infinity?</li>

  <li>Do you have any sample code to show how this works?</li>
  <li>Where can I learn more?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>These questions have to do with floating point exceptions. If you get some strange non-numeric output where you're expecting a number, you've either exceeded the finite limits of floating point arithmetic or you've asked for some result that is undefined. To keep things simple, I'll stick to working with the double floating point type. Similar remarks hold for float types.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Debugging 1.#IND, 1.#INF, nan, and inf</strong></p>
  
  <p>If your operation would generate a larger positive number than could be stored in a double, the operation will return 1.#INF on Windows or inf on Linux. Similarly your code will return -1.#INF or -inf if the result would be a negative number too large to store in a double. Dividing a positive number by zero produces a positive infinity and dividing a negative number by zero produces a negative infinity. Example code at the end of this page will demonstrate some operations that produce infinities.</p>
  
  <p>Some operations don't make mathematical sense, such as taking the square root of a negative number. (Yes, this operation makes sense in the context of complex numbers, but a double represents a real number and so there is no double to represent the result.) The same is true for logarithms of negative numbers. Both sqrt(-1.0) and log(-1.0) would return a NaN, the generic term for a ""number"" that is ""not a number"". Windows displays a NaN as  -1.#IND (""IND"" for ""indeterminate"") while Linux displays nan. Other operations that would return a NaN include 0/0, 0*∞, and ∞/∞. See the sample code below for examples. </p>
  
  <p>In short, if you get 1.#INF or inf, look for overflow or division by zero. If you get 1.#IND or nan, look for illegal operations. Maybe you simply have a bug. If it's more subtle and you have something that is difficult to compute, see  Avoiding Overflow, Underflow, and Loss of Precision. That article gives tricks for computing results that have intermediate steps overflow if computed directly.</p>

<p>I want to fork on windows. What is the most similar operation and how do I use it.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.cygwin.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cygwin</a> has fully featured fork() on Windows. Thus if using Cygwin is acceptable for you, then the problem is solved in the case performance is not an issue.</p>

<p>Otherwise you can take a look at how Cygwin implements fork(). From a quite old Cygwin's architecture <a href=""http://www.redhat.com/support/wpapers/cygnus/cygnus_cygwin/architecture.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">doc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5.6. Process Creation 
  The fork call in Cygwin is particularly interesting
  because it does not map well on top of
  the Win32 API. This makes it very
  difficult to implement correctly.
  Currently, the Cygwin fork is a
  non-copy-on-write implementation
  similar to what was present in early
  flavors of UNIX.</p>
  
  <p>The first thing that happens when a
  parent process forks a child process
  is that the parent initializes a space
  in the Cygwin process table for the
  child. It then creates a suspended
  child process using the Win32
  CreateProcess call. Next, the parent
  process calls setjmp to save its own
  context and sets a pointer to this in
  a Cygwin shared memory area (shared
  among all Cygwin tasks). It then fills
  in the child's .data and .bss sections
  by copying from its own address space
  into the suspended child's address
  space. After the child's address space
  is initialized, the child is run while
  the parent waits on a mutex. The child
  discovers it has been forked and
  longjumps using the saved jump buffer.
  The child then sets the mutex the
  parent is waiting on and blocks on
  another mutex. This is the signal for
  the parent to copy its stack and heap
  into the child, after which it
  releases the mutex the child is
  waiting on and returns from the fork
  call. Finally, the child wakes from
  blocking on the last mutex, recreates
  any memory-mapped areas passed to it
  via the shared area, and returns from
  fork itself.</p>
  
  <p>While we have some ideas as to how to
  speed up our fork implementation by
  reducing the number of context
  switches between the parent and child
  process, fork will almost certainly
  always be inefficient under Win32.
  Fortunately, in most circumstances the
  spawn family of calls provided by
  Cygwin can be substituted for a
  fork/exec pair with only a little
  effort. These calls map cleanly on top
  of the Win32 API. As a result, they
  are much more efficient. Changing the
  compiler's driver program to call
  spawn instead of fork was a trivial
  change and increased compilation
  speeds by twenty to thirty percent in
  our tests.</p>
  
  <p>However, spawn and exec present their
  own set of difficulties. Because there
  is no way to do an actual exec under
  Win32, Cygwin has to invent its own
  Process IDs (PIDs). As a result, when
  a process performs multiple exec
  calls, there will be multiple Windows
  PIDs associated with a single Cygwin
  PID. In some cases, stubs of each of
  these Win32 processes may linger,
  waiting for their exec'd Cygwin
  process to exit.</p>

<p>I can't find solution to find the random float number from the <code>[0,a]</code>, where <code>a</code> is some float defined by the user.</p>

<p>I have tried the following, but it doesn't seem to work correctly.</p>

<pre><code>float x=(float)rand()/((float)RAND_MAX/a)
</code></pre>
","<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>float x = (float)rand()/(float)(RAND_MAX/a);
</code></pre>

<p>To understand how this works consider the following. </p>

<pre><code>N = a random value in [0..RAND_MAX] inclusively.
</code></pre>

<p>The above equation (removing the casts for clarity) becomes:</p>

<pre><code>N/(RAND_MAX/a)
</code></pre>

<p>But division by a fraction is the equivalent to multiplying by said fraction's reciprocal, so this is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>N * (a/RAND_MAX)
</code></pre>

<p>which can be rewritten as:</p>

<pre><code>a * (N/RAND_MAX)
</code></pre>

<p>Considering <code>N/RAND_MAX</code> is always a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0, this will generate a value between 0.0 and <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the following, which effectively does the breakdown I showed above. I actually prefer this simply because it is clearer what is actually going on (to me, anyway):</p>

<pre><code>float x = ((float)rand()/(float)(RAND_MAX)) * a;
</code></pre>

<p>Note: the floating point representation of <code>a</code> must be <em>exact</em> or this will never hit your absolute edge case of <code>a</code> (it will get close). See <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> for the gritty details about why.</p>

"Is it possible to modify a string of char in C?","70481","","<p>I have been struggling for a few hours with all sorts of C tutorials and books related to pointers but what I really want to know is if it's possible to change a char pointer once it's been created.</p>

<p>This is what I have tried:</p>

<pre><code>char *a = ""This is a string"";
char *b = ""new string"";

a[2] = b[1]; // Causes a segment fault

*b[2] = b[1]; // This almost seems like it would work but the compiler throws an error.
</code></pre>

<p>So is there any way to change the values inside the strings rather than the pointer addresses?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for your answers. It makes more sense now. It especially makes sense why sometimes it was working fine and other times not working. Because sometimes I'd pass a char pointer and other times a char array (the char array worked fine).</p>
","<p>When you write a ""string"" in your source code, it gets written directly into the executable because that value needs to be known at compile time (there are tools available to pull software apart and find all the plain text strings in them). When you write <code>char *a = ""This is a string""</code>, the location of ""This is a string"" is in the executable, and the location a points to, is in the executable. The data in the executable image is read-only.</p>

<p>What you need to do (as the other answers have pointed out) is create that memory in a location that is not read only--on the heap, or in the stack frame. If you declare a local array, then space is made on the stack for each element of that array, and the string literal (which is stored in the executable) is copied to that space in the stack.</p>

<pre><code>char a[] = ""This is a string"";
</code></pre>

<p>you can also copy that data manually by allocating some memory on the heap, and then using <code>strcpy()</code> to copy a string literal into that space.</p>

<pre><code>char *a = malloc(256);
strcpy(a, ""This is a string"");
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you allocate space using <code>malloc()</code> remember to call <code>free()</code> when you are finished with it (read: memory leak).</p>

<p>Basically, you have to keep track of where your data is. Whenever you write a string in your source, that string is read only (otherwise you would be potentially changing the behavior of the executable--imagine if you wrote <code>char *a = ""hello"";</code> and then changed <code>a[0]</code> to <code>'c'</code>. Then somewhere else wrote <code>printf(""hello"");</code>. If you were allowed to change the first character of <code>""hello""</code>, and your compiler only stored it once (it should), then <code>printf(""hello"");</code> would output <code>cello</code>!)</p>

"How to cast or convert an unsigned int to int in C?","70425","","<p>My apologies if the question seems weird. I'm debugging my code and this seems to be the problem, but I'm not sure. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>It depends on what you want the behaviour to be. An <code>int</code> cannot hold many of the values that an <code>unsigned int</code> can.</p>

<p>You can cast as usual:</p>

<pre><code>int signedInt = (int) myUnsigned;
</code></pre>

<p>but this will cause problems if the <code>unsigned</code> value is past the max <code>int</code> can hold. This means  half of the possible <code>unsigned</code> values will result in erroneous behaviour unless you specifically watch out for it. </p>

<p>You should probably reexamine how you store values in the first place if you're having to convert for no good reason.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As mentioned by ProdigySim in the comments, the maximum value is platform dependent. But you can access it with <code>INT_MAX</code> and <code>UINT_MAX</code>.</p>

<p>For the usual 4-byte types:</p>

<pre><code>4 bytes = (4*8) bits = 32 bits
</code></pre>

<p>If all 32 bits are used, as in <code>unsigned</code>, the maximum value will be 2^32 - 1, or <code>4,294,967,295</code>.</p>

<p>A signed <code>int</code> effectively sacrifices one bit for the sign, so the maximum value will be 2^31 - 1, or <code>2,147,483,647</code>. Note that this is half of the other value.</p>

<p>If you want to have a struct with functions where functions operate on the structure you have to pass the pointer to that function by default (similar to what c++ does):</p>

<p>Define:</p>

typedef int (*FuncPtrClassABCInt)(struct ClassABC *, int);

int incrFunc(struct ClassABC * abc);
int decrFunc(struct ClassABC * abc);
int addFunc(struct ClassABC * abc, int num);
int subtractFunc(struct ClassABC * abc, int num);

struct ClassABC
{

    FuncPtrClassABC    increment;
    FuncPtrClassABC    decrement;
    FuncPtrClassABCInt add;
    FuncPtrClassABCInt subtract;
};
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see these functions could be standalone, you would still pass the ClassABC in:</p>

<pre><code>int incrFunc(struct ClassABC * abc) { return ++(abc-&gt;i); }
int decrFunc(struct ClassABC * abc) { return --(abc-&gt;i); }
int addFunc(struct ClassABC * abc, int num)
{ abc-&gt;i += num; return abc-&gt;i; }
int subtractFunc(struct ClassABC * abc, int num)
{ abc-&gt;i -= num; return abc-&gt;i; }
</code></pre>

<p>Initialization helper func:</p>

<pre><code>void initClassABC(struct ClassABC * abc)
{
    abc-&gt;i = 0;
    abc-&gt;increment = incrFunc;
    abc-&gt;decrement = decrFunc;
    abc-&gt;add = addFunc;
    abc-&gt;subtract = subtractFunc;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>struct ClassABC cabc;
initClassABC(&amp;cabc);

<p>In general, you should pick a multiplier that is in the order of your hash size (<code>2^32</code> in the example) and has no common factors with it. This way the hash function covers all your hash space uniformly.</p>

<p>Edit: The biggest disadvantage of this hash function is that it preserves divisibility, so if your integers are all divisible by 2 or by 4 (which is not uncommon), their hashes will be too. This is a problem in hash tables - you can end up with only 1/2 or 1/4 of the buckets being used.</p>

        if(i % 64 == 0) {

        }

}
</code></pre>

<p>This outputs one character per iteration. Every 64th character, it outputs a newline. Otherwise, it uses a pair of data tables to figure out what to output, and puts either character 32 (a space) or character 33 (a <code>!</code>). The first table (<code>""&gt;'txiZ^(~z?""</code>) is a set of 10 bitmaps describing the appearance of each character, and the second table (<code>"";;;====~$::199""</code>) selects the appropriate bit to display from the bitmap.</p>

<h3>The second table</h3>

<p>Let's start by examining the second table, <code>int shift = "";;;====~$::199""[(i*2&amp;8) | (i/64)];</code>. <code>i/64</code> is the line number (6 to 0) and <code>i*2&amp;8</code> is 8 iff <code>i</code> is 4, 5, 6 or 7 mod 8.</p>

<p><code>if((i &amp; 2) == 0) shift /= 8; shift = shift % 8</code> selects either the high octal digit (for <code>i%8</code> = 0,1,4,5) or the low octal digit (for <code>i%8</code> = 2,3,6,7) of the table value. The shift table ends up looking like this:</p>

<pre><code>row col val

44443377
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the author used the null terminator for the first two table entries (sneaky!).</p>

<p>This is designed after a seven-segment display, with <code>7</code>s as blanks. So, the entries in the first table must define the segments that get lit up.</p>

<h3>The first table</h3>

<p><a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Standard-Predefined-Macros.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>__TIME__</code></a> is a special macro defined by the preprocessor. It expands to a string constant containing the time at which the preprocessor was run, in the form <code>""HH:MM:SS""</code>. Observe that it contains exactly 8 characters. Note that 0-9 have ASCII values 48 through 57 and <code>:</code> has ASCII value 58. The output is 64 characters per line, so that leaves 8 characters per character of <code>__TIME__</code>.</p>

<p><code>7 - i/8%8</code> is thus the index of <code>__TIME__</code> that is presently being output (the <code>7-</code> is needed because we are iterating <code>i</code> downwards). So, <code>t</code> is the character of <code>__TIME__</code> being output.</p>

<p><code>a</code> ends up equalling the following in binary, depending on the input <code>t</code>:</p>

<pre><code>0 00111111
1 00101000
2 01110101
3 01111001
4 01101010
5 01011011
6 01011111
7 00101001
8 01111111
9 01111011
: 01000000
</code></pre>

<p>Each number is a <em>bitmap</em> describing the segments that are lit up in our seven-segment display. Since the characters are all 7-bit ASCII, the high bit is always cleared. Thus, <code>7</code> in the segment table always prints as a blank. The second table looks like this with the <code>7</code>s as blanks:</p>

<pre><code>000055  
11  55  
11  55  
116655  
22  33  
22  33  
444433  
</code></pre>

<p>So, for example, <code>4</code> is <code>01101010</code> (bits 1, 3, 5, and 6 set), which prints as</p>

<pre><code>----!!--
!!--!!--
!!--!!--
!!!!!!--
----!!--
----!!--
----!!--
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>To show we really understand the code, let's adjust the output a bit with this table:</p>

<pre><code>  00  
11  55
11  55
  66  
22  33
22  33
  44
</code></pre>

<p>This is encoded as <code>""?;;?==? '::799\x07""</code>. For artistic purposes, we'll add 64 to a few of the characters (since only the low 6 bits are used, this won't affect the output); this gives <code>""?{{?}}?gg::799G""</code> (note that the 8th character is unused, so we can actually make it whatever we want). Putting our new table in the original code:</p>

<pre><code>main(_){_^448&amp;&amp;main(-~_);putchar(--_%64?32|-~7[__TIME__-_/8%8][""&gt;'txiZ^(~z?""-48]&gt;&gt;""?{{?}}?gg::799G""[_*2&amp;8|_/64]/(_&amp;2?1:8)%8&amp;1:10);}
</code></pre>

<p>we get</p>

<pre><code>          !!              !!                              !!   
    !!  !!              !!  !!  !!  !!              !!  !!  !! 
    !!  !!              !!  !!  !!  !!              !!  !!  !! 
          !!      !!              !!      !!                   
    !!  !!  !!          !!  !!      !!              !!  !!  !! 
    !!  !!  !!          !!  !!      !!              !!  !!  !! 
          !!              !!                              !!   
</code></pre>

<p>just as we expected. It's not as solid-looking as the original, which explains why the author chose to use the table he did.</p>

"Should I return EXIT_SUCCESS or 0 from main()?","69856","","<p>It's a simple question, but I keep seeing conflicting answers: should the main routine of a C++ program return <code>0</code> or <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code>?</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
int main(){return EXIT_SUCCESS;}
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>int main(){return 0;}
</code></pre>

<p>Are they the exact same thing? Should <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> only be used with <code>exit()</code>?  </p>

<p>I thought <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> would be a better option because other software may want to deem zero as failure, but I also heard that if you return <code>0</code>, the compiler is capable of changing it to a different value anyway.</p>
","<p><code>EXIT_FAILURE</code>, either in a return statement in <code>main</code> or as an argument to <code>exit()</code>, is the only portable way to indicate failure in a C or C++ program.  <code>exit(1)</code> can actually signal successful termination on VMS, for example.</p>

<p>If you're going to be using <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code> when your program fails, then you might as well use <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> when it succeeds, just for the sake of symmetry.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the program never signals failure, you can use either <code>0</code> or <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code>.  Both are guaranteed by the standard to signal successful completion.  (It's barely possible that <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> could have a value other than 0, but it's equal to 0 on every implementation I've ever heard of.)</p>

<p>Using <code>0</code> has the minor advantage that you don't need <code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code> in C, or <code>#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;</code> in C++ (if you're using a <code>return</code> statement rather than calling <code>exit()</code>) -- but for a program of any significant size you're going to be including stdlib directly or indirectly anyway.</p>

<p>For that matter, in C starting with the 1999 standard, and in all versions of C++, reaching the end of <code>main()</code> does an implicit <code>return 0;</code> anyway, so you might not need to use either <code>0</code> or <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> explicitly.  (But at least in C, I consider an explicit <code>return 0;</code> to be better style.)</p>

<p>(Somebody asked about OpenVMS. I haven't used it in a long time, but as I recall odd status values generally denote success while even values denote failure.  The C implementation maps <code>0</code> to <code>1</code>, so that <code>return 0;</code> indicates successful termination. Other values are passed unchanged, so <code>return 1;</code> also indicates successful termination. <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code> would have a non-zero even value.)</p>

"How to read from input until newline is found using scanf()?","69841","","<p>I was asked to do a work in C when I'm supposed to read from input until there's a space and then until the user presses enter.
If I do this:</p>

<pre><code>scanf(""%2000s %2000s"", a, b);
</code></pre>

<p>It will follow the 1st rule but not the 2nd.<br>
If I write:</p>

<p>In the 1st one, it waits for the user to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> (to send EOF) and that's not what I want.
In the 2nd one, it won't compile. According to the compiler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>warning: no closing ‘]’ for ‘%[’ format</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any good way to solve this?</p>
","<p><code>scanf</code> (and cousins) have one slightly strange characteristic: any white space in the format string (outside of a scanset) matches an arbitrary amount of white space in the input. As it happens, at least in the default ""C"" locale, a new-line is classified as white space. </p>

<p>This means the trailing <code>'\n'</code> is trying to match not only <em>a</em> new-line, but any succeeding white-space as well. It won't be considered matched until you signal the end of the input, or else enter some non-white space character.</p>

<p>To deal with this, you typically want to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>scanf(""%2000s %2000[^\n]%c"", a, b, c);

if (c=='\n')
    // we read the whole line
else
    // the rest of the line was more than 2000 characters long. `c` contains a 
    // character from the input, and there's potentially more after that as well.

<p>Is it actually faster to use say <code>(i&lt;&lt;3)+(i&lt;&lt;1)</code> to multiply with 10 than using <code>i*10</code> directly? Is there any sort of input that can't be multiplied or divided in this way?</p>
","<p>Short answer:  Not likely.</p>

<p>Long answer:
Your compiler has an optimizer in it that knows how to multiply as quickly as your target processor architecture is capable.  Your best bet is to tell the compiler your intent clearly (i.e. i*2 rather than i &lt;&lt; 1) and let it decide what the fastest assembly/machine code sequence is.  It's even possible that the processor itself has implemented the multiply instruction as a sequence of shifts &amp; adds in microcode.</p>

<p>Bottom line--don't spend a lot of time worrying about this.  If you mean to shift, shift.  If you mean to multiply, multiply.  Do what is semantically clearest--your coworkers will thank you later.  Or, more likely, curse you later if you do otherwise.</p>

<p>It's the fundamental difference between ""interface"" and ""implementation""; the <em>interface</em> (header) tells you <strong>how</strong> to call some functionality (without knowing how it works), while the <em>implementation</em> (library) is the actual functionality.</p>

<p>Note: The concept is so fundamental, because it allows you flexibility: you can have the same header for different libraries (i.e. the functionality is exactly called in the same way), and each library may <em>implement</em> the functionality in a different way. By keeping the same interface, you can replace the libraries without changing <em>your</em> code.</p>

"Is it possible to convert char[] to char* in C?","68824","","<p>I'm doing an assignment where we have to read a series of strings from a file into an array. I have to call a cipher algorithm on the array (cipher transposes 2D arrays). So, at first I put all the information from the file into a 2D array, but I had a lot of trouble with conflicting types in the rest of my code (specifically trying to set char[] to char*). So, I decided to switch to an array of pointers, which made everything a lot easier in most of my code.</p>

<p>But now I need to convert char* to char[] and back again, but I can't figure it out. I haven't been able to find anything on google. I'm starting to wonder if it's even possible.</p>
","<p>It sounds like you're confused between pointers and arrays. Pointers and arrays (in this case <code>char *</code> and <code>char []</code>) are <a href=""http://c-faq.com/aryptr/aryptr2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">not the same thing. </a></p>

<ul>
<li>An array <code>char a[SIZE]</code> says that the value at the location of <code>a</code> is an array of length <code>SIZE</code></li>
<li>A pointer <code>char *a;</code> says that the value at the location of <code>a</code> is a pointer to a <code>char</code>. This can be combined with pointer arithmetic to behave like an array (eg, <code>a[10]</code> is 10 entries past wherever <code>a</code> points)</li>
</ul>

<p>In memory, it looks like this (example taken from <a href=""http://c-faq.com/aryptr/aryptr2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the FAQ</a>):</p>

<pre><code> char a[] = ""hello"";  // array

   +---+---+---+---+---+---+
a: | h | e | l | l | o |\0 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+

 char *p = ""world""; // pointer

   +-----+     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
p: |  *======&gt; | w | o | r | l | d |\0 |
   +-----+     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
</code></pre>

<p>It's easy to be confused about the difference between pointers and arrays, because in many cases, an array reference ""decays"" to a pointer to it's first element. This means that in many cases (such as when passed to a function call) arrays become pointers. If you'd like to know more, <a href=""http://c-faq.com/aryptr/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this section of the C FAQ describes the differences in detail</a>.</p>

<p>One major practical difference is that the compiler knows how long an array is. Using the examples above:</p>

<pre><code>char a[] = ""hello"";  
char *p =  ""world"";  

sizeof(a); // 6 - one byte for each character in the string,
           // one for the '\0' terminator
sizeof(p); // whatever the size of the pointer is
           // probably 4 or 8 on most machines (depending on whether it's a 
           // 32 or 64 bit machine)
</code></pre>

<p>Without seeing your code, it's hard to recommend the best course of action, but I suspect changing to use pointers everywhere will solve the problems you're currently having. Take note that now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You will need to initialise memory wherever the arrays used to be. Eg, <code>char a[10];</code> will become <code>char *a = malloc(10 * sizeof(char));</code>, followed by a check that <code>a != NULL</code>. Note that you don't actually need to say <code>sizeof(char)</code> in this case, because <code>sizeof(char)</code> is defined to be 1. I left it in for completeness.</p></li>
<li><p>Anywhere you previously had <code>sizeof(a)</code> for array length will need to be replaced by the length of the memory you allocated (if you're using strings, you could use <code>strlen()</code>, which counts up to the <code>'\0'</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>You will need a make a corresponding call to <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/3/free"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>free()</code></a> for each call to <code>malloc()</code>. This tells the computer you are done using the memory you asked for with <code>malloc()</code>. If your pointer is <code>a</code>, just write <code>free(a);</code> at a point in the code where you know you no longer need whatever <code>a</code> points to.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As another answer pointed out, if you want to get the address of the start of an array, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>char* p = &amp;a[0] 
</code></pre>

<p>You can read this as ""char pointer <code>p</code> becomes the address of element <code>[0]</code> of <code>a</code>"".</p>

"C struct memory layout?","68748","","<p>I have C# background. Very newbie to low level language like C.</p>

<p>In C#, struct's memory laid out by compiler by default. Compiler can re-order data fields or pad additional bits between fields implicitly. So I had to specify some special attribute to override this behavior for exact layout.</p>

<p>AFAIK, C does not reorder or align memory layout of a struct by default. But I heard there's a little exceptions which very hard to find.</p>

<p>What is C's memory layout behavior? (what should be re-ordered/aligned and not)</p>
","<p>In C, the compiler is allowed to dictate some alignment for every primitive type. Typically the alignment is the size of the type. But it's entirely implementation-specific.</p>

<p>Padding bytes are introduced so every object is properly aligned. Reordering is not allowed.</p>

<p>Possibly every remotely modern compiler implements <code>#pragma pack</code> which allows control over padding and leaves it to the programmer to comply with the ABI. (It is strictly nonstandard, though.)</p>

<p>From C99 §6.7.2.1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>12    Each non-bit-field member of a
  structure or union object is aligned
  in an implementation- defined manner
  appropriate to its type.</p>
  
  <p>13    Within a
  structure object, the non-bit-field
  members and the units in which
  bit-fields reside have addresses that
  increase in the order in which they
  are declared. A pointer to a structure
  object, suitably converted, points to
  its initial member (or if that member
  is a bit-field, then to the unit in
  which it resides), and vice versa.
  There may be unnamed padding within a
  structure object, but not at its
  beginning.</p>

<p>I should further mention that if you are running a 64-bit version of Windows and a 32-bit version of Qt Creator like I am, you need to make sure that you are pointing to the 32-bit versions of cdb (of which there are x86 and x64 <em>target</em> versions).

"Makefile: How to correctly include header file and its directory?","68421","","<p>I have the following makefile:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This makefile and all three source files <code>Lock.cpp</code>, <code>DBC.cpp</code>, <code>Trace.cpp</code> are located in the current directory called <code>Core</code>. One of the source file <code>Trace.cpp</code> contains a line that includes a header file outside the current directory:</p>

<pre><code>//in Trace.cpp
#include ""StdCUtil/split.h""
</code></pre>

<p>The header file <code>split.h</code> is located at one level above the current directory and then in the subdirectory called <code>StdCUtil</code>. So that's why I added <code>INC_DIR = ../StdCUtil</code> in the makefile. The overall directory structure looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>root

<p>Why this doesn't find the header file <code>split.h</code> even if I specify the <code>INC_DIR</code> in the makefile? How to correct this?</p>
","<p>These lines in your makefile,</p>

<pre><code>INC_DIR = ../StdCUtil
CFLAGS=-c -Wall -I$(INC_DIR)
DEPS = split.h

<p>and this line in your .cpp file,</p>

<pre><code>#include ""StdCUtil/split.h""
</code></pre>

<p>are in conflict.</p>

<p>With your makefile in your source directory and with that <code>-I</code> option you should be using <code>#include ""split.h"" in your source file, and your dependency should be</code>../StdCUtil/split.h`.</p>

<p>Another option:</p>

<pre><code>INC_DIR = ../StdCUtil
CFLAGS=-c -Wall -I$(INC_DIR)/..  # Ugly!
DEPS = $(INC_DIR)/split.h
</code></pre>

<p>With this your <code>#include</code> directive would remain as <code>#include ""StdCUtil/split.h""</code>.</p>

<p>Yet another option is to place your makefile in the parent directory:</p>

<pre><code>root
  |____Makefile
  |
  |___Core
  |     |____DBC.cpp
  |     |____Lock.cpp
  |     |____Trace.cpp
  |
  |___StdCUtil
        |___split.h
</code></pre>

<p>With this layout it is common to put the object files (and possibly the executable) in a subdirectory that is parallel to your <code>Core</code> and <code>StdCUtil</code> directories. <code>Object</code>, for example. With this, your makefile becomes:</p>

<pre><code>INC_DIR = StdCUtil
SRC_DIR = Core
OBJ_DIR = Object
CFLAGS  = -c -Wall -I.
SRCS = $(SRC_DIR)/Lock.cpp $(SRC_DIR)/DBC.cpp $(SRC_DIR)/Trace.cpp

# Note: The above will soon get unwieldy.
# The wildcard and patsubt commands will come to your rescue.

# Note: The above will soon get unwieldy.
# You will soon want to use an automatic dependency generator.

"Why can a string be assigned to a char* pointer, but not to a char[] array?","68069","","<p>Can someone explain why this works with the pointer: </p>

str1 = ""Hello1"";

str1 = ""new string"";

// but not this
char str2 [] = ""hello"";
str2 = ""four"";

// or this
char str3 [];
str3 = ""hello"";
str3 = ""hello"";
</code></pre>
","<p><strong>Why it works with pointers:</strong><br>
When you say <code>char * str1</code> in C, you are allocating a pointer in the memory. When you write <code>str1 = ""Hello"";</code>, you are creating a string literal in memory and making the pointer point to it. When you create another string literal <code>""new string""</code> and assign it to <code>str1</code>, all you are doing is changing where the pointer points.</p>

<p><strong>Why it doesn't work with arrays:</strong><br>
When you say <code>char str2 [] = ""Hello""</code>, you are creating a string literal and putting it in the array during its definition. It is ok to not give a size, as the array calculates it and appends a <code>'\0'</code> to it. You cannot reassign anything to that array without resizing it. That is why <code>str2 = ""four""</code> will not work. </p>

<p>In case of <code>str3</code>, it is the same case. You haven't defined the size of the array in the definition, so it calculated its size to be 0. You cannot assign anything new without resizing the array.</p>

"Representing EOF in C code?","67867","","<p>The newline character is represented by <code>""\n""</code> in C code. Is there an equivalent for the end-of-file (EOF) character?</p>
","<p>EOF is not a character (in most modern operating systems). It is simply a condition that applies to a file stream when the end of the stream is reached. The confusion arises because a user may <em>signal</em> EOF for console input by typing a special character (e.g Control-D in Unix, Linux, <em>et al</em>), but this character is not seen by the running program, it is caught by the operating system which in turn signals EOF to the process.</p>

<p>Note: in some very old operating systems EOF <em>was</em> a character, e.g. Control-Z in CP/M, but this was a crude hack to avoid the overhead of maintaining actual file lengths in file system directories.</p>

","<p><code>__func__</code> is an implicitly declared identifier that expands to a character array variable containing the function name when it is used inside of a function.  It was added to C in C99.  From <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">C99</a> §6.4.2.2/1:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Note that it is not a macro and it has no special meaning during preprocessing.  </p>

<p><code>__func__</code> was added to C++ in C++11, where it is specified as containing ""an implementation-deﬁned string"" (C++11 §8.4.1[dcl.fct.def.general]/8), which is not quite as useful as the specification in C.

<p><code>__FUNCTION__</code> is a pre-standard extension that some C compilers support (including gcc and Visual C++); in general, you should use <code>__func__</code> where it is supported and only use <code>__FUNCTION__</code> if you are using a compiler that does not support it (for example, Visual C++, which does not support C99 and does not yet support all of C++0x, does not provide <code>__func__</code>).</p>

<p><code>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</code> is a gcc extension that is mostly the same as <code>__FUNCTION__</code>, except that for C++ functions it contains the ""pretty"" name of the function including the signature of the function.  Visual C++ has a similar (but not quite identical) extension, <code>__FUNCSIG__</code>.</p>

"Override a function call in C","67348","","<p>I want to override certain function calls to various APIs for the sake of logging the calls, but I also might want to manipulate data before it is sent to the actual function.</p>

<p>For example, say I use a function called <code>getObjectName</code> thousands of times in my source code. I want to temporarily override this function sometimes because I want to change the behaviour of this function to see the different result.</p>

<p>I create a new source file like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;apiheader.h&gt;    

const char *getObjectName (object *anObject)
{
    if (anObject == NULL)
        return ""(null)"";
    else
        return ""name should be here"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>I compile all my other source as I normally would, but I link it against this function first before linking with the API's library. This works fine except I can obviously not call the real function inside my overriding function.</p>

<p>Is there an easier way to ""override"" a function without getting linking/compiling errors/warnings? Ideally I want to be able to override the function by just compiling and linking an extra file or two rather than fiddle around with linking options or altering the actual source code of my program.</p>
","<p>If it's only for your source that you want to capture/modify the calls, the simplest solution is to put together a header file (<code>intercept.h</code>) with:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef INTERCEPT
    #define getObjectName(x) myGetObectName(x)
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>and implement the function as follows (in <code>intercept.c</code> which <em>doesn't</em> include <code>intercept.h</code>):</p>

<pre><code>const char *myGetObjectName (object *anObject) {
    if (anObject == NULL)
        return ""(null)"";
    else
        return getObjectName(anObject);
}

<p>Then make sure each source file where you want to intercept the call has:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""intercept.h""
</code></pre>

<p>at the top.</p>

<p>Then, when you compile with ""<code>-DINTERCEPT</code>"", all files will call your function rather than the real one and your function can still call the real one.</p>

<p>Compiling without the ""<code>-DINTERCEPT</code>"" will prevent interception from occurring.</p>

<p>It's a bit trickier if you want to intercept all calls (not just those from your source) - this can generally be done with dynamic loading and resolution of the real function (with <code>dlload-</code> and <code>dlsym-</code>type calls) but I don't think it's necessary in your case.</p>

You should not use if-else or any other comparison operator. I found this question on online bulletin board, so i thought i should ask in StackOverflow</p>

<p>EXAMPLE
Input: 5, 10
Output: 10</p>

<p>I found this solution, can someone help me understand these lines of code</p>

<pre><code>int getMax(int a, int b) {  
    int c = a - b;  
    int k = (c &gt;&gt; 31) &amp; 0x1;  
    int max = a - k * c;

    int c = a - b;
    int k = (c &gt;&gt; 31) &amp; 0x1;
    int max = a - k * c;
    return max;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's dissect this.  This first line seems like it out to be straightforward - it stores the difference of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. This value is negative if <code>a &lt; b</code> and is nonnegative otherwise. There's actually a bug here - if the difference of the numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> is so big that it can't fit into an integer, this will lead to undefined behavior - oops! So let's assume that doesn't happen here.</p>

<p>In the next line, which is</p>

<pre><code>int k = (c &gt;&gt; 31) &amp; 0x1;
</code></pre>

<p>the idea is to check if the value of <code>c</code> is negative.  In virtually all modern computers, numbers are stored in a format called <em>two's complement</em> in which the highest bit of the number is 0 if the number is positive and 1 if the number is negative.  Moreover, most ints are 32 bits.  <code>(c &gt;&gt; 31)</code> shifts the number down 31 bits, leaving the highest bit of the number in the spot for the lowest bit.  The next step of taking this number and ANDing it with 1 (whose binary representation is 0 everywhere except the last bit) erases all the higher bits and just gives you the lowest bit.  Since the lowest bit of <code>c &gt;&gt; 31</code> is the highest bit of <code>c</code>, this reads the highest bit of <code>c</code> as either 0 or 1.  Since the highest bit is 1 iff <code>c</code> is 1, this is a way of checking whether <code>c</code> is negative (1) or positive (0).  Combining this reasoning with the above, <code>k</code> is 1 if <code>a &lt; b</code> and is 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>The final step is to do this:</p>

<pre><code>int max = a - k * c;
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>a &lt; b</code>, then <code>k == 1</code> and <code>k * c = c = a - b</code>, and so</p>

<pre><code>a - k * c = a - (a - b) = a - a + b = b
</code></pre>

<p>Which is the correct max, since <code>a &lt; b</code>.  Otherwise, if <code>a &gt;= b</code>, then <code>k == 0</code> and</p>

<pre><code>a - k * c = a - 0 = a
</code></pre>

<p>Which is also the correct max.</p>

<p>In my understanding ptr will contain the base address of array but it actually point to the memory required for the complete array (i.e 5 chars).

","<p>C lets you use the subscript operator <code>[]</code> on arrays and on pointers. When you use this operator on a pointer, the resultant type is the type to which the pointer points to. For example, if you apply <code>[]</code> to <code>int*</code>, the result would be an <code>int</code>.</p>

"I do not understand how execlp() works in Linux","66672","","<p>I have spent the last 2 days trying to understand the <code>execlp()</code> system call, but yet here I am. Let me get straight to the issue.</p>

<p>The <code>man page</code> of execlp declares the system call as <code>int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ...);</code> with the description: <em>The const char arg and subsequent ellipses in the execl(), execlp(), and execle() functions can be thought of as arg0, arg1, ..., argn.</em></p>

<p>Yet I see the system call being called like this in our text book: <code>execlp(“/bin/sh”, ..., “ls -l /bin/??”, ...);</code> (the ""..."" are for us to figure out as students). However this system call doesn´t even resemble anything like the declaration on the <code>man page</code> of the system call.</p>

<p>I am super confused. Any help is appreciated.</p>
","<p>this prototype:</p>

<pre><code>  int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ...);
</code></pre>

<p>Says that execlp ìs a variable argument function. It takes 2 <code>const char *</code>. The rest of the arguments, if any,  are the additional arguments to hand over to program we want to run - also <code>char *</code> - all these are C strings (and the last argument must be a NULL pointer)</p>

<p>So, the <code>file</code> argument is the path name of an executable file to be executed. <code>arg</code> is the string we want to appear as <code>argv[0]</code> in the executable. By convention, <code>argv[0]</code> is just the file name of the executable, normally it's set to the same as <code>file</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>...</code> are now the additional arguments to give to the executable.</p>

<p>Say you run this from a commandline/shell:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls
</code></pre>

<p>That'd be <code>execlp(""ls"", ""ls"", (char *)NULL);</code>
Or if you run</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l /
</code></pre>

<p>That'd be <code>execlp(""ls"", ""ls"", ""-l"", ""/"", (char *)NULL);</code></p>

<p>So on to <code>execlp(""/bin/sh"", ..., ""ls -l /bin/??"", ...);</code></p>

<p>Here you are going to the shell, /bin/sh , and you're giving the shell a command to execute. That command is ""ls -l /bin/??"". You can run that manually from a commandline/shell:</p>

<pre><code> $ ls -l /bin/??
</code></pre>

<p>Now, how do you run a shell and tell it to execute a command ? You open up the documentation/man page for your shell and read it.</p>

<p>What you want to run is:</p>

<pre><code>$ /bin/sh -c ""ls -l /bin/??""
</code></pre>

<p>This becomes</p>

<pre><code>  execlp(""/bin/sh"",""/bin/sh"", ""-c"", ""ls -l /bin/??"", (char *)NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>Side note:
The <code>/bin/??</code> is doing pattern matching, this pattern matching is done by the shell, and it expands to all files under /bin/ with 2 characters. If you simply did </p>

<pre><code>  execlp(""ls"",""ls"", ""-l"", ""/bin/??"", (char *)NULL);

<p>is actually undefined behaviour I.e. reading from a member of the union other than the one recently written to leads to undefined behaviour. If this isn't the intended usage of unions, what is? Can some one please explain it elaborately?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to clarify a few things in hindsight.</p>

<ul>
<li>The answer to the question isn't the same for C and C++; my ignorant younger self tagged it as both C and C++.</li>
<li>After scouring through C++11's standard I couldn't conclusively say that it calls out accessing/inspecting a non-active union member is undefined/unspecified/implementation-defined. All I could find was §9.5/1:

<blockquote>
  <p>If a standard-layout union contains several standard-layout structs that share a common initial sequence, and if an object of this standard-layout union type contains one of the standard-layout structs, it is permitted to inspect the common initial sequence of any of standard-layout struct members. §9.2/19: Two standard-layout structs share a common initial sequence if corresponding members have layout-compatible types and either neither member is a bit-field or both are bit-fields with the same width for a sequence of one or more initial members.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>While in C, (<a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/dr_283.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">C99 TC3 - DR 283</a> onwards) it's legal to do so (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2310483/purpose-of-unions-in-c-and-c#comment26826326_2313676"">thanks to Pascal Cuoq</a> for bringing this up). However, attempting to do <em>it can still lead to undefined behavior</em>, if the value read happens to be invalid (so called ""trap representation"") for the type it is read through. Otherwise, the value read is implementation defined.</li>
<li><p>C89/90 called this out under unspecified behavior (Annex J) and K&amp;R's book says it's implementation defined. Quote from K&amp;R:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the purpose of a union - a single variable that can legitimately hold any of one of several types. [...] so long as the usage is consistent: the type retrieved must be the type most recently stored. It is the programmer's responsibility to keep track of which type is currently stored in a union; the results are implementation-dependent if something is stored as one type and extracted as another.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Extract from Stroustrup's TC++PL (emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use of unions can be essential for compatness of data [...] <em>sometimes misused for ""type conversion</em>"".</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Above all, this question (whose title remains unchanged since my ask) was posed with an intention of understanding the purpose of unions AND not on what the standard allows</em> E.g. Using inheritance for code reuse is, of course, allowed by the C++ standard, but <a href=""https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/objective-c#objective-c-and-inherit"" rel=""noreferrer"">it wasn't the purpose or the original intention of introducing inheritance as a C++ language feature</a>. This is the reason Andrey's answer continues to remain as the accepted one.</p>
","<p>The purpose of unions is rather obvious, but for some reason people miss it quite often.  </p>

<p><strong>The purpose of union  is <em>to save memory</em> by using the same memory region for storing different objects at different times.</strong> That's it.</p>

<p>It is like a room in a hotel. Different people live in it for non-overlapping periods of time. These people never meet, and generally don't know anything about each other. By properly managing the time-sharing of the rooms (i.e. by making sure different people don't get assigned to one room at the same time), a relatively small hotel can provide accomodations to a relatively large number of people, which is what hotels are for.</p>

<p>That's exactly what union does. If you know that several objects in your program hold values with non-overlapping value-lifetimes, then you can ""merge"" these objects into a union and thus save memory. Just like a hotel room has at most one ""active"" tenant at each moment of time, a union has at most one ""active"" member at each moment of program time. Only the ""active"" member can be read. By writing into other member you switch the ""active"" status to that other member.</p>

<p>For some reason, this original purpose of the union got ""overriden"" with something completely different: writing one member of a union and then inspecting it through another member. This kind of memory reinterpretation (aka ""type punning"") is <strike>not a valid use of unions. It generally leads to undefined behavior</strike> is decribed as producing implemenation-defined behavior in C89/90.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Using unions for the purposes of type punning (i.e. writing one member and then reading another) was given a more detailed definition in one of the Technical Corrigendums to C99 standard (see <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/dr_257.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">DR#257</a> and <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/dr_283.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">DR#283</a>).

Is it a good idea to use pipes? Capture video in another process and feed it to the other?</p>
","<p>A pipe is a mechanism for interprocess communication. Data written to the pipe by one process can be read by another process. The primitive for creating a pipe is the <code>pipe</code> function. This creates both the reading and writing ends of the pipe. It is not very useful for a single process to use a pipe to talk to itself. In typical use, a process creates a pipe just before it <code>forks</code> one or more child processes. The pipe is then used for communication either between the parent or child processes, or between two sibling processes. A familiar example of this kind of communication can be seen in all operating system shells. When you type a command at the shell, it will spawn the executable represented by that command with a call to <code>fork</code>. A pipe is opened to the new child process and its output is read and printed by the shell. <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Creating-a-Pipe.html#Creating-a-Pipe"" rel=""noreferrer"">This page</a> has a full example of the <code>fork</code> and <code>pipe</code> functions.

","<p>You may be interested in a linear feedback shift register.
We used to build these out of hardware, but I've also done them in software. It uses a shift register with some of the bits xor'ed and fed back to the input, and if you pick just the right ""taps"" you can get a sequence that's as long as the register size.  That is, a 16-bit lfsr can produce a sequence 65535 long with no repeats.  It's statistically random but of course eminently repeatable.  Also, if it's done wrong, you can get some embarrassingly short sequences.  If you look up the lfsr, you will find examples of how to construct them properly (which is to say, ""maximal length"").</p>

"Learn C first before learning Objective-C","65790","","<p>Being an aspiring Apple developer, I want to get the opinions of the community if it is better to learn C first before moving into Objective-C and ultimately the Cocoa Framework?</p>

<p>My gut says learn C, which will give me a good foundation.</p>
","<p>I would learn C first. I learned C (and did a lot in C) before moving to Obj-C. I have many colleagues who never were real C programmers, they started with Obj-C and learned only as much C as necessary.</p>

<p>Every now and then I see how they solve a problem entirely in Obj-C, sometimes resulting in a very clumsy solutions. Usually I then replace some Obj-C code with pure C code (after all you can mix them as much as you like, the content of an Obj-C method can be entirely, pure C code). Without any intention to insult any Obj-C programmer, there are solutions that are very elegant in Obj-C, these are solutions that just work (and look) a lot better thanks to <em>objects</em> (OOP programming can make complex programs much more lovely than functional programming; polymorphism for example is a brilliant feature)... and I really like Obj-C  (much more than C++! I hate the C++ syntax and some language features are plain overkill and lead to bad development patterns IMHO); however, when I sometimes re-write Obj-C code of my colleagues (and I really only do so, if I think this is absolutely necessary), the resulting code is usually 50% smaller, needs only 25% of the memory it used before and is about 400% faster at runtime.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to say here: Every language has its pros and cons. C has pros and cons and so does Obj-C. However, the really great feature of Obj-C (that's why I even like it more than Java) is that you can jump to plain C at will and back again. Why this is such a great feature? Because just like Obj-C fixes many of the cons of pure C, pure C can fix some of the cons of Obj-C. If you mix them together you'll receive a very powerful team.</p>

<p>If you only learn Obj-C and have no idea of C or only know the very basics of it and never tried how elegantly it can solve some common problems, you actually learned only half of Obj-C. C is a fundamental part of Obj-C. The ability to use C at any time and everywhere is a fundamental feature of it.</p>

<p>A typical example was some code we used that had to encode data in base64, but we could not use an external library for that (no OpenSSL lib). We used a base64 encoder, entirely written using Cocoa classes. It was working okay, but when we made it encode 200 MB of binary data, it took an eternity and the memory overhead was unacceptable. I replaced it with a tiny, ultra compact base64 encoder written entirely as one C function (I copied the function body into the method body, method took NSData as input and returned NSString as output, however inside the function everything was C). The C encoder was so much more compact, it beat the pure Cocoa encoder by the factor 8 in speed and the memory overhead was also much less. Encoding/Decoding data, playing around with bits and similar low level tasks are just the strong points of C.</p>

<p>Another example was some UI code that drew a lot of graphs. For storing the data necessary to paint the graphs, we used NSArray's. Actually NSMutableArray's, since the graph was animated. Result: Very slow graph animation. We replaced all NSArray's with normal C arrays, objects with structs (after all graph coordinate information is nothing you must have in objects), enumerator access with simple for loops and started moving data between the arrays with memcopy instead of taking data from one array to the other one, index for index. The result: A speed up by the factor 4. The graph animated smoothly, even on older PPC systems.</p>

<p>The weakness of C is that every more complex program gets ugly in the long run. Keeping C applications readable, extensible and manageable demands a lot of discipline of a programmer. Many projects fail because this discipline is missing. Obj-C makes it easy for you to structure your application using classes, inheritance, protocols and so on. That said, I would not use pure C functionality across the borders of a method unless necessary. I prefer to keep all code in an Objective-C app within the method of an object; everything else defeats the purpose of an OO application. However within the method I sometimes use pure C exclusively.</p>

","<p>Writing a naive gaussian blur is actually pretty easy.  It is done in exactly the same way as any other convolution filter.  The only difference between a box and a gaussian filter is the matrix you use.</p>

<p>Imagine you have an image defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79
80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89
90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99
</code></pre>

<p>A 3x3 box filter matrix is defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>0.111 0.111 0.111
0.111 0.111 0.111
0.111 0.111 0.111
</code></pre>

<p>To apply the gaussian blur you would do the following:</p>

<p>For pixel 11 you would need to load pixels 0, 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22.</p>

<p>you would then multiply pixel 0 by the upper left portion of the 3x3 blur filter. Pixel 1 by the top middle, pixel 2, pixel 3 by top right, pixel 10 by middle left and so on.</p>

<p>Then add them altogether and write the result to pixel 11.  As you can see Pixel 11 is now the average of itself and the surrounding pixels.</p>

<p>Edge cases do get a bit more complex.  What values do you use for the values of the edge of the texture?   One way can be to wrap round to the other side.  This looks good for an image that is later tiled.  Another way is to push the pixel into the surrounding places.</p>

<p>So for upper left you might place the samples as follows:</p>

<pre><code> 0  0  1
 0  0  1
10 10 11
</code></pre>

<p>I hope you can see how this can easily be extended to large filter kernels (ie 5x5 or 9x9 etc).  </p>

<p>The difference between a gaussian filter and a box filter is the numbers that go in the matrix.  A gaussian filter uses a gaussian distribution across a row and column.  </p>

<p>e.g for a filter defined arbitrarily as (ie this isn't a gaussian, but probably not far off)</p>

<pre><code>0.1 0.8 0.1
</code></pre>

<p>the first column would be the same but multiplied into the first item of the row above.</p>

<pre><code>0.01 0.8 0.1
0.08 
0.01 
</code></pre>

<p>The second column would be the same but the values would be multiplied by the 0.8 in the row above (and so on).</p>

<pre><code>0.01 0.08 0.01
0.08 0.64 0.08
0.01 0.08 0.01
</code></pre>

<p>The result of adding all of the above together should equal 1.  The difference between the above filter and the original box filter would be that the end pixel written would have a much heavier weighting towards the central pixel (ie the one that is in that position already).  The blur occurs because the surrounding pixels do blur into that pixel, though not as much.  Using this sort of filter you get a blur but one that doesn't destroy as much of the high frequency (ie rapid changing of colour from pixel to pixel) information.</p>

<p>These sort of filters can do lots of interesting things.  You can do an edge detect using this sort of filter by subtracting the surrounding pixels from the current pixel.  This will leave only the really big changes in colour (high frequencies) behind.</p>

<p>Edit:  A 5x5 filter kernel is define exactly as above.</p>

<p>e.g if your row is 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.2 0.1 then if you multiply each value in their by the first item to form a column and then multiply each by the second item to form the second column and so on you'll end up with a filter of</p>

<pre><code>0.01 0.02 0.04 0.02 0.01
0.02 0.04 0.08 0.04 0.02
0.04 0.08 0.16 0.08 0.04
0.02 0.04 0.08 0.04 0.02
0.01 0.02 0.04 0.02 0.01
</code></pre>

<p>taking some arbitrary positions you can see that position 0, 0 is simple 0.1 * 0.1. Position 0, 2 is 0.1 * 0.4, position 2, 2 is 0.4 * 0.4 and position 1, 2 is 0.2 * 0.4.</p>

","<p>Pointers is a concept that for many can be confusing at first, in particular when it comes to copying pointer values around and still referencing the same memory block.</p>

<p>I've found that the best analogy is to consider the pointer as a piece of paper with a house address on it, and the memory block it references as the actual house. All sorts of operations can thus be easily explained.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: For all intents and purposes, this explanation and the example memory

<p>Get an entrepreneur to build your house, and give you the address to the house. In contrast to the real world, memory allocation cannot be told where to allocate, but will find a suitable spot with enough room, and report back the address to the allocated memory.</p>

<p>In other words, the entrepreneur will choose the spot.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Keep a variable with the address</strong></p>

<p>Write the address to your new house down on a piece of paper. This paper will serve as your reference to your house. Without this piece of paper, you're lost, and cannot find the house, unless you're already in it.</p>

<pre><code>var
    h: THouse;
begin
    h := THouse.Create('My house');
    ...

</pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Copy pointer value</strong>  </p>

<p>Just write the address on a new piece of paper. You now have two pieces of paper that will get you to the same house, not two separate houses. Any attempts to follow the address from one paper and rearrange the furniture at that house will make it seem that <em>the other house</em> has been modified in the same manner, unless you can explicitly detect that it's actually just one house.</p>

<p><em>Note</em> This is usually the concept that I have the most problem explaining to people, two pointers does not mean two objects or memory blocks.</p>

<pre><code>var
    h1, h2: THouse;
begin
    h1 := THouse.Create('My house');
    h2 := h1; // copies the address, not the house
    ...

<hr>

<p><strong>Freeing the memory</strong>  </p>

<p>Demolish the house. You can then later on reuse the paper for a new address if you so wish, or clear it to forget the address to the house that no longer exists.</p>

<pre><code>var
    h: THouse;
begin
    h := THouse.Create('My house');
    ...
    h.Free;
    h := nil;
</code></pre>

<p>Here I first construct the house, and get hold of its address. Then I do something to the house (use it, the ... code, left as an exercise for the reader), and then I free it. Lastly I clear the address from my variable.</p>

<p>Memory layout:</p>

<pre>
    h                        &lt;--+
    v                           +- before free
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---          |
    1234My house             &lt;--+

    h (now points nowhere)   &lt;--+
                                +- after free
----------------------          | (note, memory might still
    xx34My house             &lt;--+  contain some data)
</pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Dangling pointers</strong></p>

<p>You tell your entrepreneur to destroy the house, but you forget to erase the address from your piece of paper. When later on you look at the piece of paper, you've forgotten that the house is no longer there, and goes to visit it, with failed results (see also the part about an invalid reference below).</p>

<pre><code>var
    h: THouse;
begin
    h := THouse.Create('My house');
    ...
    h.Free;
    ... // forgot to clear h here
    h.OpenFrontDoor; // will most likely fail
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>h</code> after the call to <code>.Free</code> <em>might</em> work, but that is just pure luck. Most likely it will fail, at a customers place, in the middle of a critical operation.</p>

<pre>
    h                        &lt;--+
    v                           +- before free
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---          |
    1234My house             &lt;--+

    h                        &lt;--+
    v                           +- after free
----------------------          |
    xx34My house             &lt;--+
</pre>

<p>As you can see, h still points to the remnants of the data in memory, but
since it might not be complete, using it as before might fail.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Memory leak</strong>  </p>

<p>You lose the piece of paper and cannot find the house. The house is still standing somewhere though, and when you later on want to construct a new house, you cannot reuse that spot.</p>

<pre><code>var
    h: THouse;
begin
    h := THouse.Create('My house');
    h := THouse.Create('My house'); // uh-oh, what happened to our first house?
    ...
    h.Free;
    h := nil;
</code></pre>

<p>Here we overwrote the contents of the <code>h</code> variable with the address of a new house, but the old one is still standing... somewhere. After this code, there is no way to reach that house, and it will be left standing. In other words, the allocated memory will stay allocated until the application closes, at which point the operating system will tear it down.</p>

<p>Memory layout after first allocation:</p>

<pre>
    h
    v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---
    1234My house
</pre>

<p>Memory layout after second allocation:</p>

<pre>
                       h
                       v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]
    1234My house       5678My house
</pre>

<p>A more common way to get this method is just to forget to free something, instead of overwriting it as above. In Delphi terms, this will occur with the following method:</p>

<pre><code>procedure OpenTheFrontDoorOfANewHouse;
var
    h: THouse;
begin
    h := THouse.Create('My house');
    h.OpenFrontDoor;
    // uh-oh, no .Free here, where does the address go?
end;
</code></pre>

<p>After this method has executed, there's no place in our variables that the address to the house exists, but the house is still out there.</p>

<p>Memory layout:</p>

<pre>
    h                        &lt;--+
    v                           +- before losing pointer
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---          |
    1234My house             &lt;--+

    h (now points nowhere)   &lt;--+
                                +- after losing pointer
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---          |
    1234My house             &lt;--+
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the old data is left intact in memory, and will not
be reused by the memory allocator. The allocator keeps track of which
areas of memory has been used, and will not reuse them unless you
free it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Freeing the memory but keeping a (now invalid) reference</strong>  </p>

<p>Demolish the house, erase one of the pieces of paper but you also have another piece of paper with the old address on it, when you go to the address, you won't find a house, but you might find something that resembles the ruins of one.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will even find a house, but it is not the house you were originally given the address to, and thus any attempts to use it as though it belongs to you might fail horribly.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might even find that a neighbouring address has a rather big house set up on it that occupies three address (Main Street 1-3), and your address goes to the middle of the house. Any attempts to treat that part of the large 3-address house as a single small house might also fail horribly.</p>

<pre><code>var
    h1, h2: THouse;
begin
    h1 := THouse.Create('My house');
    h2 := h1; // copies the address, not the house
    ...
    h1.Free;
    h1 := nil;
    h2.OpenFrontDoor; // uh-oh, what happened to our house?
</code></pre>

<p>Here the house was torn down, through the reference in <code>h1</code>, and while <code>h1</code> was cleared as well, <code>h2</code> still has the old, out-of-date, address. Access to the house that is no longer standing might or might not work.</p>

<p>This is a variation of the dangling pointer above. See its memory layout.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Buffer overrun</strong>  </p>

<p>You move more stuff into the house than you can possibly fit, spilling into the neighbours house or yard. When the owner of that neighbouring house later on comes home, he'll find all sorts of things he'll consider his own.</p>

<p>This is the reason I chose a fixed-size array. To set the stage, assume that
the second house we allocate will, for some reason, be placed before the
first one in memory. In other words, the second house will have a lower
address than the first one. Also, they're allocated right next to each other.</p>

<p>Thus, this code:</p>

<pre><code>var
    h1, h2: THouse;
begin
    h1 := THouse.Create('My house');
    h2 := THouse.Create('My other house somewhere');
                         ^-----------------------^
                          longer than 10 characters

<p>The part that will most often cause crash is when you overwrite important parts
of the data you stored that really should not be randomly changed. For instance
it might not be a problem that parts of the name of the h1-house was changed,
in terms of crashing the program, but overwriting the overhead of the
object will most likely crash when you try to use the broken object,
as will overwriting links that is stored to
other objects in the object.</p>

<p><strong>Linked lists</strong>  </p>

<p>When you follow an address on a piece of paper, you get to a house, and at that house there is another piece of paper with a new address on it, for the next house in the chain, and so on.</p>

<pre><code>var
    h1, h2: THouse;
begin
    h1 := THouse.Create('Home');
    h2 := THouse.Create('Cabin');
    h1.NextHouse := h2;
</code></pre>

<p>Here we create a link from our home house to our cabin. We can follow the chain until a house has no <code>NextHouse</code> reference, which means it's the last one. To visit all our houses, we could use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var
    h1, h2: THouse;
    h: THouse;
begin
    h1 := THouse.Create('Home');
    h2 := THouse.Create('Cabin');
    h1.NextHouse := h2;
    ...
    h := h1;
    while h &lt;&gt; nil do
    begin

<p><strong>In basic terms, what is a memory address?</strong></p>

<p>A memory address is in basic terms just a number. If you think of memory
as a big array of bytes, the very first byte has the address 0, the next one
the address 1 and so on upwards. This is simplified, but good enough.</p>

<p>So this memory layout:</p>

<pre>
    h1                 h2
    v                  v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]
    1234My house       5678My house
</pre>

<p>Might have these two address (the leftmost - is address 0):</p>

<ul>
<li>h1 = 4</li>
<li>h2 = 23</li>
</ul>

<p>Which means that our linked list above might actuall look like this:</p>

<pre>
    h1 (=4)                 h2 (=28)
    v                       v
---[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL]----[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL]
    1234Home      0028      5678Cabin     0000
                   |        ^              |
                   +--------+              * (no link)
</pre>

<p>It is typical to store an address that ""points nowhere"" as a zero-address.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>In basic terms, what is a pointer?</strong></p>

<p>A pointer is just a variable holding a memory address. You can typically ask the programming
language to give you its number, but most programming languages and runtimes tries to
hide the fact that there is a number beneath, just because the number itself does not
really hold any meaning to you. It is best to think of a pointer as a black box, ie.
you don't really know or care about how it is actually implemented, just as long as it
works.</p>

"How do I get a thread ID from an arbitrary pthread_t?","65188","","<p>I have a pthread_t, and I'd like to change its CPU affinity. The problem is that I'm using glibc 2.3.2, which doesn't have <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/pthread_setaffinity_np.3.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">pthread_setaffinity_np()</a>. That's OK, though, because pthread_setaffinity_np() is itself a wrapper of <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/2/sched_setaffinity"" rel=""noreferrer"">sched_setaffinity()</a>, which can be called by passing a thread ID instead of a process ID to set the affinity for an arbitrary thread.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> ... The thread id that sched_setaffinity can work with is an OS thread id, the kind that you can get from the <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/2/gettid"" rel=""noreferrer"">gettid()</a> system call. <strong>This is different from the opaque type pthread_t</strong>, and gettid() will only return the thread-id of the <em>current thread</em>. I need to be able to set the CPU affinity of an arbitrary thread.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't access the pthread's private parts, which would let me steal the thread id by casting a pthread_t to a <code>struct pthread *</code>. All the better, I guess, since relying on private implementations is asking for even <em>more</em> trouble.</p>

<p>I've also been reading up on the <a href=""http://cs.pub.ro/~apc/2003/resources/pthreads/uguide/users-23.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">pthread_getunique_np</a> function, however this returns a ""unique integral identifier"" -- which I don't believe is in any way shape or form equivalent to an OS thread id.</p>

<p>Hence, the question: How can I get a thread ID from an arbitrary pthread_t?</p>
","<p>Since <code>pthread</code>s do not need to be implemented with Linux threads (or kernel threads at all, for that matter), and some implementations are entirely user-level or mixed, the <code>pthread</code>s interface does not provide functions to access these implementation details, as those would not be portable (even across <code>pthread</code>s implementations on Linux).  Thread libraries that use those could provide this as an extension, but there do not seem to be any that do.</p>

<p>Other than accessing internal data structures of the threading library (which you understandably do not want, although with your assumptions about processor affinity and Linux thread IDs, your code will not be portable anyway), you may be able to play a trick at creation time, if you control the code that creates the threads:</p>

<p>Give <code>pthread_create()</code> an entry function that calls <code>gettid()</code> (which by the way you are likely to have to do using the <code>syscall</code> macro directly because it is not always exported by <code>libc</code>), stores the result somewhere, and then calls the original entry function.  If you have multiple threads with the same entry function, you can pass an incremented pointer into an array in the <code>arg</code> argument to <code>pthread_create</code>, which will then be passed to the entry function you created to store the thread ID in.  Store the <code>pthread_t</code> return value of <code>pthread_create</code> in the same order, and then you will be able to look up the Linux thread IDs of all threads you created given their <code>pthread_t</code> value.</p>

<p>Whether this trick is worth it, depends on how important setting the CPU affinity is in your case, versus not accessing internal structures of the thread library or depending on a thread library that provides <code>pthread_setaffinity_np</code>.</p>

"Pass an array to a function by value","65143","","<p>Below is a snippet from the book <em>C Programming Just the FAQs</em>. Isn't this wrong as Arrays can never be passed by reference?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>VIII.6: How can you pass an array to a function by value?</strong>  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> An array can be passed to a function by value by declaring in
  the called function the array name
  with square brackets (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>)
  attached to the end. When calling the
  function, simply pass the address of
  the array (that is, the array’s name)
  to the called function. For instance,
  the following program passes the array
  <code>x[]</code> to the function named
  <code>byval_func()</code> by value:</p>
  
  <p>The <code>int[]</code> parameter tells the
  compiler that the <code>byval_func()</code>
  function will take one argument—an
  array of integers. When the
  <code>byval_func()</code> function is called, you
  pass the address of the array to
  <code>byval_func()</code>:  </p>

<pre><code>byval_func(x);
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Because the array is being passed by
  value, an exact copy of the array is
  made and placed on the stack. The
  called function then receives this
  copy of the array and can print it.
  Because the array passed to
  <code>byval_func()</code> is a copy of the
  original array, modifying the array
  within the <code>byval_func()</code> function has
  no effect on the original array.</p>
</blockquote>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Because the array is being passed by value, an exact copy of the array is made and placed on the stack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is incorrect: <strong>the array itself is not being copied</strong>, only a copy of the pointer to its address is passed to the callee (placed on the stack). (Regardless of whether you declare the parameter as <code>int[]</code> or <code>int*</code>, it <a href=""http://c-faq.com/aryptr/aryptrparam.html""><em>decays into a pointer</em></a>.) <strong>This allows you to modify the contents of the array from within the called function</strong>. Thus, this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because the array passed to byval_func() is a copy of the original array, modifying the array within the byval_func() function has no effect on the original array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is plain wrong (kudos to @Jonathan Leffler for his comment below). However, reassigning the pointer inside the function will not change the pointer to the original array outside the function.</p>

"Converting from signed char to unsigned char and back again?","65125","","<p>I'm working with JNI and have an array of type jbyte, where jbyte is represented as an signed char i.e. ranging from -128 to 127. The jbytes represent image pixels. For image processing, we usually want pixel components to range from 0 to 255. I therefore want to convert the jbyte value to the range 0 to 255 (i.e. the same range as unsigned char), do some calculations on the value and then store the result as a jbyte again.</p>

<p>How can I do these conversion safely? </p>

<p>I managed to get this code to work, where a pixel value is incremented by 30 but clamped to the value 255, but I don't understand if it's safe or portable:</p>

<pre><code> #define CLAMP255(v) (v &gt; 255 ? 255 : (v &lt; 0 ? 0 : v))

 jbyte pixel = ...
 pixel = CLAMP_255((unsigned char)pixel + 30);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm interested to know how to do this in both C and C++.</p>
","<p>This is one of the reasons why C++ introduced the new cast style, which includes <code>static_cast</code> and <code>reinterpret_cast</code></p>

<p>There's two things you can mean by saying conversion from signed to unsigned, you might mean that you wish the unsigned variable to contain the value of the signed variable modulo the maximum value of your unsigned type + 1. That is if your signed char has a value of -128 then <code>CHAR_MAX+1</code> is added for a value of 128 and if it has a value of -1, then <code>CHAR_MAX+1</code> is added for a value of 255, this is what is done by static_cast. On the other hand you might mean to interpret the bit value of the memory referenced by some variable to be interpreted as an unsigned byte, regardless of the signed integer representation used on the system, i.e. if it has bit value <code>0b10000000</code> it should evaluate to value 128, and 255 for bit value <code>0b11111111</code>, this is accomplished with reinterpret_cast.</p>

<p>Now, for the two's complement representation this happens to be exactly the same thing, since -128 is represented as <code>0b10000000</code> and -1 is represented as <code>0b11111111</code> and likewise for all in between. However other computers (usually older architectures) may use different signed representation such as sign-and-magnitude or ones' complement. In ones' complement the <code>0b10000000</code> bitvalue would not be -128, but -127, so a static cast to unsigned char would make this 129, while a reinterpret_cast would make this 128. Additionally in ones' complement the <code>0b11111111</code> bitvalue would not be -1, but -0, (yes this value exists in ones' complement,) and would be converted to a value of 0 with a static_cast, but a value of 255 with a reinterpret_cast. Note that in the case of ones' complement the unsigned value of 128 can actually not be represented in a signed char, since it ranges from -127 to 127, due to the -0 value.</p>

<p>I have to say that the vast majority of computers will be using two's complement making the whole issue moot for just about anywhere your code will ever run. You will likely only ever see systems with anything other than two's complement in very old architectures, think '60s timeframe.</p>

<p>The syntax boils down to the following:</p>

"How to get ip address from sock structure in c?","65058","","<p>I'm writing simple server/client and trying to get client IP address and save it on server side to decide which client should get into critical section.

<p>I believe this is a way to get IP from sock struct after server accept request from client. More specifically in c after server execute </p>

","<p>OK assuming you are using IPV4 then do the following:</p>

<pre><code>struct sockaddr_in* pV4Addr = (struct sockaddr_in*)&amp;client_addr;
struct in_addr ipAddr = pV4Addr-&gt;sin_addr;
</code></pre>

<p>If you then want the ip address as a string then do the following:</p>

<pre><code>char str[INET_ADDRSTRLEN];
inet_ntop( AF_INET, &amp;ipAddr, str, INET_ADDRSTRLEN );

<p>IPV6 is pretty easy as well ...</p>

struct in6_addr ipAddr       = pV6Addr-&gt;sin6_addr;

"main() function in C","65035","","<p>I've been learning C programming in a self-taught fashion for some weeks, and there are some questions that I have concerning the <code>main()</code> function.</p>

</ol>
","<ol>
<li>You need either a definition or a prototype in order to properly call a function, but <code>main</code> must never be called from any other function, so it <em>must not</em> be declared.</li>
<li>Because the C standard says so. Operating systems pass the return value to the calling program (usually the shell). Some compilers will accept <code>void main</code>, but this is a non-standard extension (it usually means ""always return zero to the OS"").</li>
<li>By convention, a non-zero return value signals that an error occurred. Shell scripts and other programs can use this to find out if your program terminated successfully.</li>

","<p>If you type more than four characters then the extra characters and the null terminator will be written outside the end of the array, overwriting memory not belonging to the array. This is a buffer overflow. </p>

<p>C does not prevent you from clobbering memory you don't own. This results in <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior"">undefined behavior</a></strong>.

<p>This is a great example of why <code>scanf(""%s"")</code> is dangerous and should never be used. It doesn't know about the size of your array which means there is no way to use it safely. Instead, avoid scanf and use something safer, like <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/3/fgets"">fgets()</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fgets() reads in at most <strong>one less than size</strong> characters from stream and stores them into the buffer pointed to by s. Reading stops after an EOF or a newline. If a newline is read, it is stored into the buffer. A terminating null byte ('\0') is stored after the last character in the buffer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>if (fgets(A, sizeof A, stdin) == NULL) {
    /* error reading input */
}

if (A[length - 1] == '\n') {
    A[length - 1] = '\0';

Although my C is rusty, I can read the code but I don't really have a grasp on why certain lines are the way the are. For example, I want to know if a variable is true or false and send it back to another application. Rather than setting the variable to 1 or 0, the original implementor chose 0xFF.</p>

<p>Is he trying to set it to an address space? or else why set a boolean variable to be 255?</p>
","<p><code>0xFF</code> sets all the bits in a char. </p>

<p>The original implementer probably decided that the standard <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> wasn't good enough and decided that if all bits <em>off</em> is <em>false</em> then all bits <em>on</em> is <em>true</em>.</p>

<p>That works because in C any value other than 0 is true.
Though this will set all bytes in a char, it will also work for any other variable type, since any one bit being set in a variable makes it true.</p>

"SSE SSE2 and SSE3 for GNU C++","64299","","<p>Is there a simple tutorial for me to get up to speed in SSE, SSE2 and SSE3 in GNU C++?  How can you do code optimization in SSE?</p>
","<p>Sorry don't know of a tutorial.</p>

<p>Your best bet (IMHO) is to use SSE via the ""intrinsic"" functions Intel provides to wrap (generally) single SSE instructions.
These are made available via a set of include files named *mmintrin.h e.g xmmintrin.h is the original SSE instruction set.</p>

<p>Begin familiar with the contents of Intel's Optimization <a href=""http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reference Manual</a> is a good idea (see section 4.3.1.2 for an example of intrinsics) and the SIMD sections are essential reading.  The instruction set reference manuals are pretty helpful too, in that each instruction's documentation includes the ""intrinsic"" function it corresponds to.</p>

<p><em>Do</em> spend some time inspecting the assembler produced by the compiler from intrinsics (you'll learn a lot) and on profiling/performance measurement (you'll avoid wasting time SSE-ing code for little return on the effort).</p>

<p><strong>Update 2011-05-31:</strong> There is some very nice coverage of intrinsics and vectorization in Agner Fog's <a href=""http://agner.org/optimize/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">optimization PDFs</a> (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/695222/code-optimization-bibles/695293#695293"">thanks</a>) although it's a bit spread about (e.g section 12 of the <a href=""http://agner.org/optimize/optimizing_cpp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">first one</a> and section 5 of the <a href=""http://agner.org/optimize/optimizing_assembly.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">second one</a>).  These aren't exactly tutorial material (in fact there's a ""these manuals are not for beginners"" warning) but they do rightly treat SIMD (whether used via asm, intrinsics or compiler vectorization) as just one part of the larger optimization toolbox.</p>

"What are the differences between .so and .dylib on osx?","64252","","<p>.dylib is the dynamic library extension on OSX, but it's never been clear to me when I can't / shouldn't use a traditional unix .so shared object.</p>

<p>Some of the questions I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>At a conceptual level, what are the main differences between .so and .dylib?</li>
<li>When can/should I use one over the other? </li>
<li>Compilation tricks &amp; tips (For example, the replacement for gcc -shared -fPIC, since that doesn't work on osx)</li>
</ul>
","<p>The Mach-O object file format used by Mac OS X for executables and libraries distinguishes between <strong>shared libraries</strong> and <strong>dynamically loaded modules</strong>. Use <code>otool -hv some_file</code> to see the filetype of <code>some_file</code>.</p>

<p>Mach-O shared libraries have the file type <strong><code>MH_DYLIB</code></strong> and carry the extension .dylib. They can be linked against with the usual static linker flags, e.g. <code>-lfoo</code> for libfoo.dylib.  They can be created by passing the <code>-dynamiclib</code> flag to the compiler. (<code>-fPIC</code> is the default and needn't be specified.)</p>

<p>Loadable modules are called ""bundles"" in Mach-O speak. They have the file type <strong><code>MH_BUNDLE</code></strong>. They can carry any extension; the extension <code>.bundle</code> is recommended by Apple, but most ported software uses <code>.so</code> for the sake of compatibility.  Typically, you'll use bundles for <strong>plug-ins</strong> that extend an application; in such situations, the bundle will link against the application binary to gain access to the application’s exported API.  They can be created by passing the <code>-bundle</code> flag to the compiler.</p>

<p>Both dylibs and bundles can be dynamically loaded using the <code>dl</code> APIs (e.g. <code>dlopen</code>, <code>dlclose</code>).  It is not possible to link against bundles as if they were shared libraries. However, it is possible that a bundle is linked against real shared libraries; those will be loaded automatically when the bundle is loaded.</p>

<p>Historically, the differences were more significant.  In Mac OS X 10.0, there was no way to dynamically load libraries.  A set of dyld APIs (e.g. <code>NSCreateObjectFileImageFromFile</code>, <code>NSLinkModule</code>) were introduced with 10.1 to load and unload bundles, but they didn't work for dylibs.  A <code>dlopen</code> compatibility library that worked with bundles was added in 10.3; in 10.4, <code>dlopen</code> was rewritten to be a native part of dyld and added support for loading (but not unloading) dylibs. Finally, 10.5 added support for using <code>dlclose</code> with dylibs and deprecated the dyld APIs.</p>

<p>On ELF systems like Linux, <a href=""http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">both use the same file format</a>; any piece of shared code can be used as a library and for dynamic loading.</p>

<p>Finally, be aware that in Mac OS X, <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Bundle.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">""bundle""</a> can <em>also</em> refer to directories with a standardized structure that holds executable code and the resources used by that code.  There is some conceptual overlap (particularly with ""loadable bundles"" like plugins, which generally contain executable code in the form of a Mach-O bundle), but they shouldn't be confused with Mach-O bundles discussed above.</p>

"String termination - char c=0 vs char c='\0'","64208","","<p>When terminating a string, it seems to me that logically <code>char c=0</code> is equivalent to <code>char c='\0'</code>, since the ""null"" (ASCII 0) byte is <code>0</code>, but usually people tend to do <code>'\0'</code> instead.

<p>What is the preferred choice?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <strong><em>K&amp;R</em></strong> <em>says</em>: ""The character constant <code>'\0'</code> represents the character with value zero, the null character. <code>'\0'</code> is often written instead of <code>0</code> to emphasize the character nature of some expression, but the numeric value is just <code>0</code>.</p>

"What are the major differences between Objective-C, C, and C++?","64118","","<p>I'm just beginning to learn Objective-C, and am finding that a background in C (which I don't have) is a useful starting point.  I've dabbled in C++ so have some understanding of basic C++ paradigms and syntax.  (FWIW, I have extensive experience in Java and higher-level languages like JavaScript and ActionScript.)</p>

<p>I'm interested in exploring iOS development, but a bit wary of focusing in on a language useful only on a single vendor's platform.  I'd like to know more about how concepts I will learn as I proceed with Objective-C will transfer (or not) to knowledge of C and C++.</p>

<p>I'm interested mainly in core language concepts, but information on portability, frameworks, targetable platforms, etc. is welcome as well.</p>
","<p>What you need to know: Objective-C is a <strong>strict superset of C,</strong> so everything that is valid C is also valid Objective-C. Objective-C just adds a thin object-oriented layer on top of C (in fact, the Objective-C runtime itself is implemented in pure C).</p>

<p>What I generally suggest to beginners is to <strong>master C first,</strong> because if they don't understand pointers, type conversions, variadic arguments, etc. they'll have serious headache during the development of <strong>The Worlds Best iPhone App Ever (TM).</strong> Until you don't master C, don't try to get into Objective-C and especially into the Cocoa Touch API, since it can be very confusing for a beginner in C.</p>

<p>Also, C is cross-platform, and is <strong>the</strong> language for native development, hands in hands with C++, from desktop computers through mobile devices to microcontrollers. It's a common conception that ""if a system has a C compiler, that's enough to do anything that is available on the platform"". Some people think that C is dead, but <em>that's definitely not true.</em> (According to statistics, at least - <a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this chart suggests</a> it was the most popular language in October 2012.)</p>

<p>C++: it is based on C, and also adds some object-oriented extensions to C, although it's not a strict superset of C. This means that <strong>you can write C code that is invalid in C++</strong> or <strong>that does something different in C++ than that in C.</strong></p>

<p>C++ is also a good language of choice for practically any kind of native development (and it's  popular also), but again, it's a large language with a bloated grammar, and you also have to learn the concepts behind C before diving deep into C++, or you'll also have problems with the differences between pointers and references, operator overloading, name mangling, etc.</p>

<p>Well, that's it, pretty much. Conclusion: learn C very well first and you'll be in the possession of a powerful, cross-platform and widely used language; then learn Objective-C for iOS and Mac OS X development and C++ ""just for fun"" and for a handy and also powerful OO language.</p>

"GUI development: Qt vs GTK","63529","","<p>I'm new to programming with graphic user interface. I code mostly in C++ and I need my code and GUI to be OS independent so after doing some research I just can't decide between Qt or GTK. I read that GTK is more memory efficient but some sites said it was before Qt 4. Also Qt has the Qt creator IDE which I think is a wonderful IDE for C++. ¿Anyone knows more about the pros and cons of each one? Thanks</p>
","<p>Yay, another Lib_One vs Lib_Two kind of questions. I love answering these. </p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Firstly, there is no perfect magical toolkit that fits everyone's needs. Your choice should be based on <em>what you are trying to do</em>. </p>

<ul>
<li>Do you just want a GUI Toolkit? Or do you want a complete application development framework with APIs for Graphics, Sound, Image IO etc. ?</li>
<li>Are you targeting a specific platform? </li>
<li>Do you need extra eye candy?</li>
<li>What does your client want?</li>
<li>Are you targeting embedded systems or the PC?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gui Toolkit</h2>

<p>Both GTK+ and Qt are considerably mature Object Oriented GUI Toolkits. They are both open-source, cross-platform and have large active communities. GTK+ is used as the standard toolkit for the GNOME, LXDE and Xfce Desktop Environments while Qt is used for KDE. Both have been used for developing professional applications and are time-tested.</p>

<h2>Cross-Platform Compatibility</h2>

<p>Both toolkits support almost all mainstream PC Platforms. </p>

<p><strong>Platforms Supported By Both:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Windows XP </li>
<li>Windows Vista </li>
<li>Windows 7 </li>
<li>Mac OS X </li>
<li>Linux / Unix </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In addition Qt also supports:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Symbian S60</li>
<li>Windows CE</li>
<li>WebOS</li>
<li>Android</li>
<li>Ubuntu Phone</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>This is seriously debatable. GTK+ evangelists point to the high memory consumption of Qt apps, while Qt fans jeer at the GTK runtime's start-up time. But overall, there isn't any great difference. Both run fast enough on modern PCs.</p>

<h2>Proprietary Use &amp; Language Bindings</h2>

<p>GTK+ is LGPL licensed so it can be used for proprietary apps. Qt is triple licensed with LGPL, GPL and a proprietary license. If you use LGPL or buy the proprietary license, you can use Qt for proprietary apps.</p>

<p>Both Toolkits have bindings for all popular languages. Notable bindings include GTK#, the C# Binding for GTK+, which has been endorsed by the Mono Project. And Qt-Jambi, the Qt binding for Java, which is actively updated. </p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Both toolkits are extensively documented. With GTK+ having its own documentation ( GTK-Doc ), and Qt being documented by Nokia. However Qt may have a slight edge here because it has the huge resources and manpower of a huge corporation behind it (Nokia), while GTK+ is only documented by its contributors. There are tutorials on many places on the internet for both of them. I prefer <a href=""http://zetcode.com/"">ZetCode</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As you can see both of them are more-or-less good enough. The choice really depends on the point I made earlier: what are your <em>requirements</em>?</p>

"What are the differences between poll and select?","63528","","<p>I am referring to the POSIX standard <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(Unix)"" rel=""noreferrer"">select</a> and <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/2/poll"" rel=""noreferrer"">poll</a> system C API calls.</p>
","<p>I think that <a href=""http://www.unixguide.net/network/socketfaq/2.14.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> answers your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu):</p>
  
  <p>The basic difference is that select()'s fd_set is a bit mask and
  therefore has some fixed size.  It would be possible for the kernel to
  not limit this size when the kernel is compiled, allowing the
  application to define FD_SETSIZE to whatever it wants (as the comments
  in the system header imply today) but it takes more work.  4.4BSD's
  kernel and the Solaris library function both have this limit.  But I
  see that BSD/OS 2.1 has now been coded to avoid this limit, so it's 
  doable, just a small matter of programming. :-)  Someone should file a
  Solaris bug report on this, and see if it ever gets fixed.</p>
  
  <p>With poll(), however, the user must allocate an array of pollfd
  structures, and pass the number of entries in this array, so there's
  no fundamental limit.  As Casper notes, fewer systems have poll() than
  select, so the latter is more portable.  Also, with original
  implementations (SVR3) you could not set the descriptor to -1 to tell
  the kernel to ignore an entry in the pollfd structure, which made it 
  hard to remove entries from the array; SVR4 gets around this.
  Personally, I always use select() and rarely poll(), because I port my
  code to BSD environments too.  Someone could write an implementation
  of poll() that uses select(), for these environments, but I've never
  seen one. Both select() and poll() are being standardized by POSIX
  1003.1g.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>October 2017 Update:</h3>

<p>The email referenced above is at least as old as 2001; the <code>poll()</code> command is now (2017) supported across all modern operating systems - including BSD.  In fact, some people believe that <code>select()</code> <a href=""https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/e/2013/10/10-the_problem_with_select_vs_poll.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">should be deprecated</a>.  Opinions aside, portability issues around <code>poll()</code> are no longer a concern on modern systems.  Furthermore, <code>epoll()</code> has since been developed (you can <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">read the man page</a>), and continues to rise in popularity.</p>

<p>For modern development you probably don't want to use <code>select()</code>, although there's nothing explicitly wrong with it.  <code>poll()</code>, and it's more modern evolution <code>epoll()</code>, provide the same features (and more) as <code>select()</code> without suffering from the limitations therein.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The preprocessor operator <code>##</code>
  provides a way to concatenate actual
  arguments during macro expansion. If a
  parameter in the replacement text is
  adjacent to a <code>##</code>, the parameter is
  replaced by the actual argument, the
  <code>##</code> and surrounding white space are
  removed, and the result is re-scanned.
  For example, the macro <code>paste</code>
  concatenates its two arguments:</p>
  
  <p><code>#define  paste(front, back)  front ## back</code></p>
  
  <p>so <code>paste(name, 1)</code> creates the token
  <code>name1</code>.</p>

<p>Here they want to use a two-byte string instead of a one-byte-per-char string. This probably looks like it is really pointless, but they do it for a good reason.</p>

<pre><code> std::wstring BuildDate = std::wstring(WIDEN(__DATE__)) + L"" "" + WIDEN(__TIME__);

<p>They use it with another macro that returns a string with the date and time.</p>

<p><em>(Update: I have moved all assembly code to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub"" rel=""noreferrer"">GitHub</a>: They made the post bloated and apparently add very little value to the questions as the <code>fno-align-*</code> flags have the same effect.)</em></p>

<p>The generated assembly with <a href=""https://gist.github.com/baharev/7069582#file-os"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>-Os</code></a> and <a href=""https://gist.github.com/baharev/7069582#file-o2"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>-O2</code></a>.
Unfortunately, my understanding of assembly is very limited, so I have no idea whether what I did next was correct: I grabbed the assembly for <code>-O2</code> and merged all its differences into the assembly for <code>-Os</code> <em>except</em> the <code>.p2align</code> lines, result <a href=""https://gist.github.com/baharev/7069582#file-o2merged"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.

<p><strong>How can I make sure that such accidental lucky / unlucky alignments are not interfering when I do micro-optimizations (unrelated to stack alignment) on C or C++ source code?</strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Following <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/19471213/341970"">Pascal Cuoq's answer</a> I tinkered a little bit with the alignments. By passing <code>-O2 -fno-align-functions -fno-align-loops</code> to gcc, all <code>.p2align</code> are gone from the assembly and the generated executable runs in 0.38s. According to the <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">gcc documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-Os enables all -O2 optimizations [but] -Os disables the following optimization flags:</p>

  -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition &lt;br/&gt;
  -fprefetch-loop-arrays &lt;br/&gt;

<p><strong>So, it pretty much seems like a (mis)alignment issue.</strong></p>

<p>I am still skeptical about <code>-march=native</code> as suggested in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/19471823/341970"">Marat Dukhan's answer</a>. I am not convinced that it isn't just interfering with this (mis)alignment issue; it has absolutely no effect on my machine. (Nevertheless, I upvoted his answer.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p><strong>We can take <code>-Os</code> out of the picture.</strong> The following times are obtained by compiling with</p>

<ul>

<p>I have examined <em>everything</em> that <code>perf -e</code> can spit out on my machine; not just the stats that are given above.</p>

<p>For the same executable, the <code>stalled-cycles-frontend</code> shows linear correlation with the execution time; I did not notice anything else that would correlate so clearly. (Comparing <code>stalled-cycles-frontend</code> for different executables doesn't make sense to me.)</p>

<p>I included the cache misses as it came up as the first comment. I examined all the cache misses that can be measured on my machine by <code>perf</code>, not just the ones given above. The cache misses are very very noisy and show little to no correlation with the execution times.</p>
","<p>My colleague helped me find a plausible answer to my question. He noticed the importance of the 256 byte boundary. He is not registered here and encouraged me to post the answer myself (and take all the fame).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it the padding that is the culprit in this case? Why and how?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It all boils down to alignment.</strong> Alignments can have a significant impact on the performance, that is why we have the <code>-falign-*</code> flags in the first place.</p>

<p>I have submitted <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58863"" rel=""noreferrer"">a (bogus?) bug report to the gcc developers</a>. It turns out that the default behavior is <em>""we align loops to 8 byte by default but try to align it to 16 byte if we don't need to fill in over 10 bytes.""</em> Apparently, this default is not the best choice in this particular case and on my machine. Clang 3.4 (trunk) with <code>-O3</code> does the appropriate alignment and the generated code does not show this weird behavior.</p>

<p>Of course, <strong>if an inappropriate alignment is done, it makes things worse.</strong> An unnecessary / bad alignment just eats up bytes for no reason and potentially increases cache misses, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The noise it makes pretty much makes timing micro-optimizations
  impossible.</p>
  
  <p>How can I make sure that such accidental lucky / unlucky alignments
  are not interfering when I do micro-optimizations (unrelated to stack
  alignment) on C or C++ source codes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Simply by telling gcc to do the right alignment:</strong></p>

<p><code>g++ -O2 -falign-functions=16 -falign-loops=16</code></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p>

<p>The code will run slower if:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>an <code>XX</code> byte boundary cuts <code>add()</code> in the middle (<code>XX</code> being machine dependent).</p></li>
<li><p>if the call to <code>add()</code> has to jump over an <code>XX</code> byte boundary and the target is not aligned.</p></li>
<li><p>if  <code>add()</code> is not aligned.</p></li>
<li><p>if the loop is not aligned.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first 2 are beautifully visible on the codes and results that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/19471823/341970"">Marat Dukhan kindly posted</a>. In this case, <code>gcc-4.8.1 -Os</code> (executes in 0.994 secs):</p>

<pre><code>00000000004004fd &lt;_ZL3addRKiS0_.isra.0&gt;:
  4004fd:       8d 04 37                lea    eax,[rdi+rsi*1]
  400500:       c3   
</code></pre>

<p>a 256 byte boundary cuts <code>add()</code> right in the middle and neither <code>add()</code> nor the loop is aligned. Surprise, surprise, this is the slowest case!</p>

<p>In case <code>gcc-4.7.3 -Os</code> (executes in 0.822 secs), the 256 byte boundary only cuts into a cold section (but neither the loop, nor <code>add()</code> is cut):</p>

<pre><code>00000000004004fa &lt;_ZL3addRKiS0_.isra.0&gt;:
  4004fa:       8d 04 37                lea    eax,[rdi+rsi*1]

</code></pre>

<p>Nothing is aligned, and the call to <code>add()</code> has to jump over the 256 byte boundary. This code is the second slowest.</p>

<p>In case <code>gcc-4.6.4 -Os</code> (executes in 0.709 secs), although nothing is aligned, the call to <code>add()</code> doesn't have to jump over the 256 byte boundary and the target is exactly 32 byte away:</p>

<pre><code>  4004f2:       e8 db ff ff ff          call   4004d2 &lt;_ZL3addRKiS0_.isra.0&gt;
  4004f7:       01 c3                   add    ebx,eax
  4004f9:       ff cd                   dec    ebp

</code></pre>

<p>This is the fastest of all three. Why the 256 byte boundary is speacial on his machine, I will leave it up to him to figure it out. I don't have such a processor.</p>

<p>Now, on my machine I don't get this 256 byte boundary effect. Only the function and the loop alignment kicks in on my machine. If I pass <code>g++ -O2 -falign-functions=16 -falign-loops=16</code> then everything is back to normal: I always get the fastest case and the time isn't sensitive to the <code>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</code> flag anymore. I can pass <code>g++ -O2 -falign-functions=32 -falign-loops=32</code> or any multiples of 16, the code is not sensitive to that either.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I first noticed in 2009 that gcc (at least on my projects and on my
  machines) have the tendency to generate noticeably faster code if I
  optimize for size (-Os) instead of speed (-O2 or -O3) and I have been
  wondering ever since why.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A likely explanation is that I had hotspots which were sensitive to the alignment, just like the one in this example. By messing with the flags (passing <code>-Os</code> instead of <code>-O2</code>), those hotspots were aligned in a lucky way by accident and the code became faster. <strong>It had nothing to do with optimizing for size: These were by sheer accident that the hotspots got aligned better.</strong> From now on, I will check the effects of alignment on my projects.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing. <strong>How can such hotspots arise, like the one shown in the example? How can the inlining of such a tiny function like <code>add()</code> fail?</strong></p>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>// add.cpp
int add(const int&amp; x, const int&amp; y) {
    return x + y;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in a separate file:</p>

<pre><code>// main.cpp
int add(const int&amp; x, const int&amp; y);

const int LOOP_BOUND = 200000000;

__attribute__((noinline))
static int work(int xval, int yval) {
    int sum(0);
    for (int i=0; i&lt;LOOP_BOUND; ++i) {
        int x(xval+sum);
        int y(yval+sum);
        int z = add(x, y);
        sum += z;
    }
    return sum;
}

int main(int , char* argv[]) {
    int result = work(*argv[1], *argv[2]);
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and compiled as: <code>g++ -O2 add.cpp main.cpp</code>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>gcc won't inline <code>add()</code>!</strong></p>

<p>That's all, it's that easy to  unintendedly create hotspots like the one in the OP. <strong>Of course it is partly my fault: gcc is an excellent compiler.</strong> If compile the above as: <code>g++ -O2 -flto add.cpp main.cpp</code>, that is, <strong>if I perform link time optimization, the code runs in 0.19s!</strong> </p>

<p>(Inlining is artificially disabled in the OP, hence, the code in the OP was 2x slower).</p>

"Why do pthreads’ condition variable functions require a mutex?","63371","","<p>I’m reading up on <code>pthread.h</code>; the condition variable related functions (like <code>pthread_cond_wait(3)</code>) require a mutex as an argument. Why? As far as I can tell, I’m going to be creating a mutex <em>just</em> to use as that argument? What is that mutex supposed to do?</p>
","<p>It's just the way that condition variables are (or were originally) implemented.</p>

<p>The mutex is used to protect <em>the condition variable itself</em>. That's why you need it locked before you do a wait.</p>

<p>The wait will ""atomically"" unlock the mutex, allowing others access to the condition variable (for signalling). Then when the condition variable is signalled or broadcast to, one or more of the threads on the waiting list will be woken up and the mutex will be magically locked again for that thread.</p>

<p>You typically see the following operation with condition variables, illustrating how they work. The following example is a worker thread which is given work via a signal to a condition variable.</p>

<pre><code>thread:
    initialise.
    lock mutex.
    while thread not told to stop working:
        wait on condvar using mutex.
        if work is available to be done:
            do the work.
    unlock mutex.
    clean up.
    exit thread.
</code></pre>

<p>The work is done within this loop provided that there is some available when the wait returns. When the thread has been flagged to stop doing work (usually by another thread setting the exit condition then kicking the condition variable to wake this thread up), the loop will exit, the mutex will be unlocked and this thread will exit.</p>

<p>The code above is a single-consumer model as the mutex remains locked while the work is being done. For a multi-consumer variation, you can use, as an <em>example</em>:</p>

<pre><code>thread:
    initialise.
    lock mutex.
    while thread not told to stop working:
        wait on condvar using mutex.
        if work is available to be done:
            copy work to thread local storage.
            unlock mutex.
            do the work.
            lock mutex.
    unlock mutex.
    clean up.
    exit thread.
</code></pre>

<p>which allows other consumers to receive work while this one is doing work.</p>

<p>The condition variable relieves you of the burden of polling some condition instead allowing another thread to notify you when something needs to happen. Another thread can tell that thread that work is available as follows:</p>

<pre><code>lock mutex.
flag work as available.
signal condition variable.
unlock mutex.
</code></pre>

<p>The vast majority of what are often erroneously called spurious wakeups was generally always because multiple threads had been signalled within their <code>pthread_cond_wait</code> call (broadcast), one would return with the mutex, do the work, then re-wait.</p>

<p>Then the second signalled thread could come out when there was no work to be done. So you had to have an extra variable indicating that work should be done (this was inherently mutex-protected with the condvar/mutex pair here - other threads needed to lock the mutex before changing it however).</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> technically possible for a thread to return from a condition wait without being kicked by another process (this is a genuine spurious wakeup) but, in all my many years working on pthreads, both in development/service of the code and as a user of them, I never once received one of these. Maybe that was just because HP had a decent implementation :-)</p>

<p>In any case, the same code that handled the erroneous case also handled genuine spurious wakeups as well since the work-available flag would not be set for those.</p>

","<p>Without knowing your full application it is hard to say what the best way to approach the problem is, but a common technique is to use a header which starts with a fixed length field, which denotes the length of the rest of your message.</p>

<p>Assume that your header consist only of a 4 byte integer which denotes the length of the rest of your message. Then simply do the following.</p>

<pre><code>// This assumes buffer is at least x bytes long,
// and that the socket is blocking.
void ReadXBytes(int socket, unsigned int x, void* buffer)
{
    int bytesRead = 0;
    int result;
    while (bytesRead &lt; x)
    {
        result = read(socket, buffer + bytesRead, x - bytesRead);
        if (result &lt; 1 )
        {
            // Throw your error.
        }

        bytesRead += result;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then later in the code</p>

<pre><code>unsigned int length = 0;
char* buffer = 0;
// we assume that sizeof(length) will return 4 here.
ReadXBytes(socketFileDescriptor, sizeof(length), (void*)(&amp;length));
buffer = new char[length];
ReadXBytes(socketFileDescriptor, length, (void*)buffer);

// Then process the data as needed.

delete [] buffer;

<p>This makes a few assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>ints are the same size on the sender and receiver.</li>
<li>Endianess is the same on both the sender and receiver.</li>
<li>You have control of the protocol on both sides</li>
<li>When you send a message you can calculate the length up front.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it is common to want to explicitly know the size of the integer you are sending across the network define them in a header file and use them explicitly such as:</p>

<pre><code>// These typedefs will vary across different platforms
// such as linux, win32, OS/X etc, but the idea
// is that a Int8 is always 8 bits, and a UInt32 is always
// 32 bits regardless of the platform you are on.
// These vary from compiler to compiler, so you have to 
// look them up in the compiler documentation.
typedef char Int8;
typedef short int Int16;
typedef int Int32;

typedef unsigned char UInt8;
typedef unsigned short int UInt16;
typedef unsigned int UInt32;

<pre><code>UInt32 length = 0;
char* buffer = 0;

ReadXBytes(socketFileDescriptor, sizeof(length), (void*)(&amp;length));
buffer = new char[length];

","<p><code>break</code> interacts solely with the closest enclosing loop or switch, whether it be a <code>for</code>, <code>while</code> or <code>do .. while</code> type.

<pre><code>for (A; B; C) D;
// translates to

goto test;
loop: D;

<p>Anyone knows why I'm getting it and how to fix it?</p>
","<p>Well, as you said yourself, <code>pLastLetter</code> is an array of <code>char *</code> pointers, while <code>str</code> is an array of <code>const char</code>. The <code>&amp;str[strIndex-1]</code> expression has type <code>const char*</code>. You are not allowed to assign a <code>const char*</code> value to a <code>char *</code> pointer. That would violate the rules of const-correctness. In fact, what you are doing is an error in C. C compilers traditionally report it as a mere ""warning"" to avoid breaking some old legacy code.</p>

<p>As for ""how to fix it""... It depends on what you are trying to do. Either make <code>pLastLetter</code> an array of <code>const char*</code> or remove the <code>const</code> from <code>str</code>.</p>

<p>If I were to call the functions on a substantially long array, would these two functions behave differently, would they take more space on the stack?</p>
","<p>First, some <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf"">standardese</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>6.7.5.3 Function declarators (including prototypes)</b><br>
...<br>
7 A declaration of a parameter as ‘‘array of <i>type</i>’’ shall be adjusted to ‘‘qualified pointer to
<i>type</i>’’, where the type qualifiers (if any) are those specified within the <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> of the
array type derivation. If the keyword <code>static</code> also appears within the <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> of the
array type derivation, then for each call to the function, the value of the corresponding
actual argument shall provide access to the first element of an array with at least as many
elements as specified by the size expression.
</blockquote>

<p>So, in short, any function parameter declared as <code>T a[]</code> or <code>T a[N]</code> is treated <em>as though</em> it were declared <code>T *a</code>.  </p>

<p>So, why are array parameters treated as though they were declared as pointers?  Here's why:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>6.3.2.1 Lvalues, arrays, and function designators</b><br>
...<br>
3 Except when it is the operand of the <code>sizeof</code> operator or the unary <code>&</code> operator, or is a
string literal used to initialize an array, an expression that has type ‘‘array of <i>type</i>’’ is
converted to an expression with type ‘‘pointer to <i>type</i>’’ that points to the initial element of
the array object and is not an lvalue. If the array object has register storage class, the
behavior is undefined.
</blockquote>

<p>Given the following code:</p>

<pre><code>int main(void)
{
  int arr[10];
  foo(arr);
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the call to <code>foo</code>, the array expression <code>arr</code> isn't an operand of either <code>sizeof</code> or <code>&amp;</code>, so its type is implicitly converted from ""10-element array of <code>int</code>"" to ""pointer to <code>int</code>"" according to 6.2.3.1/3. Thus, <code>foo</code> will receive a pointer value, rather than an array value.  </p>

<p>Because of 6.7.5.3/7, you can write <code>foo</code> as</p>

<pre><code>void foo(int a[]) // or int a[10]
{
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>but it will be interpreted as </p>

<pre><code>void foo(int *a)
{
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, the two forms are identical.  </p>

<p>The last sentence in 6.7.5.3/7 was introduced with C99, and basically means that if you have a parameter declaration like</p>

<pre><code>void foo(int a[static 10])
{
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>the actual parameter corresponding to <code>a</code> must be an array with <em>at least</em> 10 elements.</p>

"Does C have a string type?","63128","","<p>I have recently started programming in C, coming from Java and Python. Now, in my book I have noticed that to make a ""Hello World"" program, the syntax is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>char message[10]
strcpy(message, ""Hello, world!"")
printf(""%s\n"", message);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this example is using a char array and I wondered - what happened to strings? Why can't I simply use one of those? Maybe there is a different way to do this?</p>
","<p>C does not and never has had a native string type. By convention, the language uses arrays of <code>char</code> terminated with a null char, i.e., with <code>'\0'</code>. Functions and macros in the language's standard libraries provide support for the null-terminated character arrays, e.g., <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/strlen.html"">strlen</a> iterates over an array of <code>char</code> until it encounters a <code>'\0'</code> character and <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/strcpy.html"">strcpy</a> copies from the source string until it encounters a <code>'\0'</code>.</p>

<p>The use of null-terminated strings in C reflects the fact that C was intended to be only a little more high-level than assembly language. Zero-terminated strings were already directly supported at that time in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string#History"">assembly language for the PDP-10 and PDP-11</a>.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this property of C strings leads to quite a few nasty buffer overrun bugs, including serious security flaws. For example, if you forget to null-terminate a character string passed as the source argument to <code>strcpy</code>, the function will keep copying sequential bytes from whatever happens to be in memory past the end of the source string until it happens to encounter a <code>0</code>, potentially overwriting whatever valuable information follows the destination string's location in memory.</p>

<p>In your code example, the string literal ""Hello, world!"" will be compiled into a 14-byte long array of <code>char</code>. The first 13 bytes will hold the letters, comma, space, and exclamation mark and the final byte will hold the null-terminator character <code>'\0'</code>, automatically added for you by the compiler. If you were to access the array's last element, you would find it equal to <code>0</code>. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>const char foo[] = ""Hello, world!"";
assert(foo[12] == '!');
assert(foo[13] == '\0');
</code></pre>

<p>However, in your example, <code>message</code> is only 10 bytes long. <code>strcpy</code> is going to write all 14 bytes, including the null-terminator, into memory starting at the address of <code>message</code>. The first 10 bytes will be written into the memory allocated on the stack for <code>message</code> and the remaining four bytes will simply be written on to the end of the stack. The consequence of writing those four extra bytes onto the stack is hard to predict in this case (in this simple example, it might not hurt a thing), but in real-world code it usually leads to corrupted data or memory access violation errors.</p>

","<p>In general, it's a better idea to avoid opening files to get random data, because of how many points of failure there are in the procedure. </p>

<p>On recent Linux distributions, the <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrandom.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>getrandom</code></a> system call can be used to get crypto-secure random numbers, and it cannot fail <strong>if</strong> <code>GRND_RANDOM</code> is <em>not</em> specified as a flag and the read amount is at most 256 bytes.</p>

<p>As of October 2017, OpenBSD, Darwin and Linux (with <code>-lbsd</code>) now all have an implementation of <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man3/arc4random.3?query=arc4random&amp;sec=3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>arc4random</code></a> that is crypto-secure and that cannot fail. That makes it a very attractive option:</p>

<pre><code>char myRandomData[50];
arc4random_buf(myRandomData, sizeof myRandomData); // done!
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, you can use the random devices as if they were files. You read from them and you get random data. I'm using <code>open</code>/<code>read</code> here, but <code>fopen</code>/<code>fread</code> would work just as well.</p>

<pre><code>int randomData = open(""/dev/urandom"", O_RDONLY);
if (randomData &lt; 0)
{
    // something went wrong
}
else
{
    char myRandomData[50];

    if (result &lt; 0)
    {
        // something went wrong
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may read many more random bytes before closing the file descriptor. /dev/urandom never blocks and always fills in as many bytes as you've requested, unless the system call is interrupted by a signal. It is considered cryptographically secure and should be your go-to random device.</p>

<p>/dev/random is more finicky. On most platforms, it can return fewer bytes than you've asked for and it can block if not enough bytes are available. This makes the error handling story more complex:</p>

<pre><code>int randomData = open(""/dev/random"", O_RDONLY);
if (randomData &lt; 0)
{
    // something went wrong
}
else
{
    char myRandomData[50];

    while (randomDataLen &lt; sizeof myRandomData)
    {
        ssize_t result = read(randomData, myRandomData + randomDataLen, (sizeof myRandomData) - randomDataLen);
        if (result &lt; 0)
        {
            // something went wrong

<blockquote>
  <p>A function can be defined to be <code>inline</code>. For example: </p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>inline int fac(int n)
{
  return (n &lt; 2) ? 1 : n * fac(n-1);
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>inline</code> specifier is a hint to the compiler that it should attempt to generate code for a call of <code>fac()</code> inline rather than laying down the code for the function once and then calling through the usual function call mechanism. A clever compiler can generate the constant <code>720</code> for a call <code>fac(6)</code>. The possibility of mutually recursive inline functions, inline functions that recurse or not depending on input, etc., makes it impossible to guarantee that every call of an <code>inline</code> function is actually inlined. The degree of cleverness of a compiler cannot be legislated, so one compiler might generate <code>720</code>, another <code>6 * fac(5)</code>, and yet another an un-inlined call <code>fac(6)</code>. </p>
  
  <p>To make inlining possible in the absence of unusually clever compilation and linking facilities, the definition–and not just the declaration–of an inline function must be in scope (§9.2). An <code>inline</code> especifier does not affect the semantics of a function. In particular, an inline function still has a unique address and so has <code>static</code> variables (§7.1.2) of an inline function.</p>

  <p>A function declaration (8.3.5, 9.3, 11.4) with an <code>inline</code> specifier declares an inline function. The inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the point of call is to be preferred to the usual function call mechanism. An implementation is not required to perform this inline substitution at the point of call; however, even if this inline substitution is omitted, the other rules for inline functions defined by 7.1.2 shall still be respected.</p>

<p>Now the pointer arithmetic part. Just as a typed structure pointer can be advanced by the size of the structure in bytes, so can a full dimension of an array be hopped over. This is easier to understand if you think of the multi-dimensioned array as I declared ar2 above:</p>

<pre><code>int (*arptr)[5] = ar1; // first row, address of ar1[0][0].
++arptr;               // second row, address of ar[1][0].
</code></pre>

<p>All of this goes away with a bare pointer:</p>

<pre><code>int *ptr = ar1; // first row, address of ar1[0][0].
++ptr;          // first row, address of ar1[0][1].
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, when doing the pointer arithmetic for two-dimensional array, the following would NOT work in getting the element at <code>[2][2]</code> of a multi-dimensioned array:</p>

<pre><code>#define NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS   5
int y[5][NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS];
int x = *(y + 2 * NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS + 2); // WRONG
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is hopefully obvious when you remember that <code>y</code> is an array of arrays (declaratively speaking). The pointer arithmetic of adding the scaler <code>(2*5 + 2)</code> to <code>y</code> will add 12 <em>rows</em>, thereby computing and address equivalent to <code>&amp;(y[12])</code>, which is clearly not right, and in fact, will either throw a fat warning at compile time or outright fail to compile altogether. This is avoided with the cast of <code>(int*)y</code> and the resulting type of the expression being based on an bare pointer-to-int:</p>

<pre><code>#define NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS   5
int y[5][NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS];
int x = *((int *)y + 2 * NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS + 2); // Right!

","<p>The reason you are getting junk is because you're allocating""<code>newstr</code> on the stack and then returning its value. This is a big no-no in C. Every function you call afterwards, including the <code>printf()</code> function itself, will trample all over what you just allocated.</p>

<p>C is unfortunately a bit of a dangerous language. It will not stop you from returning a string you allocated on the stack to a calling function even though that memory is no longer safe to use once the function it was declared in returns.</p>

<p>Instead of allocating the string this way, you need to allocate fresh memory on the heap for it using <code>malloc()</code> or <code>calloc()</code> and set <code>newstr</code> to point to it. For example, you could declare:</p>

"How do you query a pthread to see if it is still running?","62749","","<p>In my destructor I want to destroy a thread cleanly.</p>

<p>My goal is to wait for a thread to finish executing and THEN destroy the thread.</p>

<p>The only thing I found about querying the state of a pthread is <a href=""https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/man/pthread_attr_getdetachstate.txt"" rel=""noreferrer"">pthread_attr_setdetachstate</a> but this only tells you if your thread is:</p>

<ul>
<li>PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED </li>
<li>PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of those have nothing to do with whether the thread is still running or not.</p>

<p><strong>How do you query a pthread to see if it is still running?</strong></p>
","<p>It sounds like you have two questions here:</p>

<h2>How can I wait until my thread completes?</h2>

<p>Answer: This is directly supported by pthreads -- make your thread-to-be-stopped JOINABLE (when it is first started), and use pthread_join() to block your current thread until the thread-to-be-stopped is no longer running.</p>

<hr>

<h2>How can I tell if my thread is still running?</h2>

<p>Answer: You can add a ""thread_complete"" flag to do the trick:</p>

<p>Scenario:  Thread A wants to know if Thread B is still alive.</p>

<p>When Thread B is created, it is given a pointer to the ""thread_complete"" flag address.  The ""thread_complete"" flag should be initialized to NOT_COMPLETED before the thread is created.  Thread B's entry point function should immediately call pthread_cleanup_push() to push a ""cleanup handler"" which sets the ""thread_complete"" flag to COMPLETED.</p>

<p>See details about cleanup handlers here: <a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/pthread_cleanup_pop.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">pthread cleanup handlers</a></p>

<p>You'll want to include a corresponding pthread_cleanup_pop(1) call to ensure that the cleanup handler gets called no matter what (i.e. if the thread exits normally OR due to cancellation, etc.).</p>

<p>Then, Thread A can simply check the ""thread_complete"" flag to see if Thread B has exited yet.</p>

<p>NOTE:  Your ""thread_complete"" flag should be declared ""volatile"" and should be an atomic type -- the GNU compilers provide the sig_atomic_t for this purpose.  This allows the two threads consistent access the same data without the need for synchronization constructs (mutexes/semaphores).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There's no <code>lib.obj</code> in OpenCV folders. I've only unziped <code>OpenCV-2.3.0-win-superpack.exe</code>, without using CMake software.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
","<p>Well, the <a href=""http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/VisualC++_VS2010"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>official guide</strong></a> is for installing <strong>OpenCV 2.1</strong> on VS2010, so I wrote some instructions below that shows how to properly install and configure the <strong>x86</strong> version of <strong>OpenCV 2.3</strong> on <strong>Visual Studio 2010</strong> (Express), since a lot of folks seem to have problems setting it up correctly.</p>

<p>Download <a href=""http://tenet.dl.sourceforge.net/project/opencvlibrary/opencv-win/2.3/OpenCV-2.3.0-win-superpack.exe"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>OpenCV-2.3.0-win-superpack.exe</em></a> and execute it to extract all files to a folder named <code>OpenCV2.3</code>. Inside this folder there are 2 directories: <code>build</code> and <code>opencv</code>. All the setup on VS2010 will refer to the <code>build</code> directory. For practical purposes I moved the folder <code>OpenCV2.3</code> to my <code>C:\</code> drive, so pay attention to the paths I suggest on this guide as yours might be different.</p>

<p>On Visual Studio, create a new <strong>Win32 Console Application</strong> project and name it whatever you like. After that, a new window will show up. Click on the tab <strong>Application Settings</strong> and make sure the option <strong>Empty Project</strong> gets selected:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kcO26.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Add a new file <code>main.cpp</code> to the folder <code>Source Files</code>, then add this code to <code>main.cpp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cv.h&gt;
#include &lt;highgui.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
if (argc &lt; 2)
{
    printf(""Usage: ./opencv_hello &lt;file.png&gt;\n"");
    return -1;
}

    IplImage* img = cvLoadImage(argv[1], CV_LOAD_IMAGE_UNCHANGED);
if (!img)
{
    return -1;
}

cvNamedWindow(""display"", CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE);
    cvShowImage(""display"", img );

    cvWaitKey(0);        

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, we need to configure the project so it can locate OpenCV headers and libraries. Go to the Project Properties (<strong>ALT+F7</strong>), and once the new window shows up do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On the <strong>Configuration</strong> box, select <strong>All Configurations</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Open <strong>Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General</strong>, and edit the field <strong>Additional Include Directories</strong> to add these 3 paths (for the headers):</p>

<p><code>C:\OpenCV2.3\build\include\opencv</code></p>

<p><code>C:\OpenCV2.3\build\include\opencv2</code></p>

<p><code>C:\OpenCV2.3\build\include</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uL750.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Note that <code>include\opencv</code> is for the C interface of OpenCV and <code>include\opencv2</code> if for the C++ interface. We are also adding the folder <code>include</code> to prevent our build from being broken by some headers of the C interface that refer to C++ headers as <code>opencv2\core</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Then, add the path of the libraries on <strong>Configuration Properties > Linker > General</strong>, and on the <strong>Additional Library Directories</strong> field, add this: <code>C:\OpenCV2.3\build\x86\vc9\lib</code>:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GXqJx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>Finally, for this simple test we are going to add the libraries <code>opencv_core230.lib</code> and <code>opencv_highgui230.lib</code>. So go to <strong>Configuration Properties > Linker > Input</strong> and add them:</li>
</ul>

"Inline functions vs Preprocessor macros","62619","","<p>How does an inline function differ from a preprocessor macro?</p>
","<p>Preprocessor macros are just substitution patterns applied to your code. They can be used almost anywhere in your code because they are replaced with their expansions before any compilation starts.</p>

<p>Inline functions are actual functions whose body is directly injected into their call site. They can only be used where a function call is appropriate.</p>

<p>Now, as far as using macros vs. inline functions in a function-like context, be advised that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Macros are not type safe, and can be expanded regardless of whether they are syntatically correct - the compile phase will report errors resulting from macro expansion problems.</li>
<li>Macros can be used in context where you don't expect, resulting in problems</li>
<li>Macros are more flexible, in that they can expand other macros - whereas inline functions don't necessarily do this.</li>
<li>Macros can result in side effects because of their expansion, since the input expressions are copied wherever they appear in the pattern.</li>
<li>Inline function are not always guaranteed to be inlined - some compilers only do this in release builds, or when they are specifically configured to do so. Also, in some cases inlining may not be possible.</li>
<li>Inline functions can provide scope for variables (particularly static ones), preprocessor macros can only do this in code blocks {...}, and static variables will not behave exactly the same way.</li>

"How to read/write arbitrary bits in C/C++","61494","","<p>Assuming I have a byte b with the binary value of 11111111</p>

<p>How do I for example read a 3 bit integer value starting at the second bit or write a four bit integer value starting at the fifth bit?</p>
","<p>Some 2+ years after I asked this question I'd like to explain it the way I'd want it explained back when I was still a complete newb and would be most beneficial to people who want to understand the process.</p>

<p>First of all, forget the ""11111111"" example value, which is not really all that suited for the visual explanation of the process. So let the initial value be <code>10111011</code> (187 decimal) which will be a little more illustrative of the process.</p>

<p><strong>1 - how to read a 3 bit value starting from the second bit:</strong></p>

<pre><code>    ___  &lt;- those 3 bits
10111011 
</code></pre>

<p>The value is 101, or 5 in decimal, there are 2 possible ways to get it:</p>

<ul>
<li>mask and shift</li>
</ul>

<p>In this approach, the needed bits are first masked with the value <code>00001110</code> (14 decimal) after which it is shifted in place:</p>

<pre><code>    ___
10111011 AND
00001110 =
00001010 &gt;&gt; 1 =
     ___
00000101
</code></pre>

<p>The expression for this would be: <code>(value &amp; 14) &gt;&gt; 1</code></p>

<ul>
<li>shift and mask</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach is similar, but the order of operations is reversed, meaning the original value is shifted and then masked with <code>00000111</code> (7) to only leave the last 3 bits:</p>

<pre><code>    ___
10111011 &gt;&gt; 1
     ___
01011101 AND
00000111
00000101
</code></pre>

<p>The expression for this would be: <code>(value &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 7</code></p>

<p>Both approaches involve the same amount of complexity, and therefore will not differ in performance.</p>

<p><strong>2 - how to write a 3 bit value starting from the second bit:</strong></p>

<p>In this case, the initial value is known, and when this is the case in code, you may be able to come up with a way to set the known value to another known value which uses less operations, but in reality this is rarely the case, most of the time the code will know neither the initial value, nor the one which is to be written.</p>

<p>This means that in order for the new value to be successfully ""spliced"" into byte, the target bits must be set to zero, after which the shifted value is ""spliced"" in place, which is the first step:</p>

<pre><code>    ___ 
10111011 AND
11110001 (241) =
10110001 (masked original value)
</code></pre>

<p>The second step is to shift the value we want to write in the 3 bits, say we want to change that from 101 (5) to 110 (6)</p>

<pre><code>     ___
00000110 &lt;&lt; 1 =
    ___
00001100 (shifted ""splice"" value)
</code></pre>

<p>The third and final step is to splice the masked original value with the shifted ""splice"" value:</p>

<pre><code>10110001 OR
00001100 =
    ___
10111101
</code></pre>

<p>The expression for the whole process would be: <code>(value &amp; 241) | (6 &lt;&lt; 1)</code></p>

<p><strong>Bonus - how to generate the read and write masks:</strong></p>

<p>Naturally, using a binary to decimal converter is far from elegant, especially in the case of 32 and 64 bit containers - decimal values get crazy big. It is possible to easily generate the masks with expressions, which the compiler can efficiently resolve during compilation:</p>

<ul>
<li>read mask for ""mask and shift"": <code>((1 &lt;&lt; fieldLength) - 1) &lt;&lt; (fieldIndex - 1)</code>, assuming that the index at the first bit is 1 (not zero)</li>
<li>read mask for ""shift and mask"": <code>(1 &lt;&lt; fieldLength) - 1</code> (index does not play a role here since it is always shifted to the first bit</li>
<li>write mask : just invert the ""mask and shift"" mask expression with the <code>~</code> operator</li>
</ul>

<p>How does it work (with the 3bit field beginning at the second bit from the examples above)?</p>

<pre><code>00000001 &lt;&lt; 3
00001000  - 1
00000111 &lt;&lt; 1
00001110  ~ (read mask)
11110001    (write mask)
</code></pre>

<p>The same examples apply to wider integers and arbitrary bit width and position of the fields, with the shift and mask values varying accordingly.</p>

<p>Also note that the examples assume unsigned integer, which is what you want to use in order to use integers as portable bit-field alternative (regular bit-fields are in no way guaranteed by the standard to be portable), both left and right shift insert a padding 0, which is not the case with right shifting a signed integer.</p>

<p><strong>Even easier:</strong></p>

<p>Using this set of macros (but only in C++ since it relies on the generation of member functions):</p>

<pre><code>#define GETMASK(index, size) (((1 &lt;&lt; (size)) - 1) &lt;&lt; (index))
#define READFROM(data, index, size) (((data) &amp; GETMASK((index), (size))) &gt;&gt; (index))
#define WRITETO(data, index, size, value) ((data) = ((data) &amp; (~GETMASK((index), (size)))) | ((value) &lt;&lt; (index)))
#define FIELD(data, name, index, size) \
  inline decltype(data) name() { return READFROM(data, index, size); } \
  inline void set_##name(decltype(data) value) { WRITETO(data, index, size, value); }
</code></pre>

<p>You could go for something as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>struct A {
  uint bitData;
  FIELD(bitData, one, 0, 1)
  FIELD(bitData, two, 1, 2)
};
</code></pre>

<p>And have the bit fields implemented as properties you can easily access:</p>

<pre><code>A a;
a.set_two(3);
cout &lt;&lt; a.two();
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>decltype</code> with gcc's <code>typeof</code> pre-C++11.</p>

"maximum memory which malloc can allocate","61086","","<p>I was trying to figure out how much memory I can malloc to maximum extent on my machine
(1 Gb RAM 160 Gb HD Windows platform).</p>

<p>I read that the maximum memory malloc can allocate is limited to physical memory (on heap).</p>

<p>Also when a program exceeds consumption of memory to a certain level, the computer stops working because other applications do not get enough memory that they require.</p>

<p>So to confirm, I wrote a small program in C:</p>

<pre><code>int main(){  
    int *p;
    while(1){
        p=(int *)malloc(4);
        if(!p)break;
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was hoping that there would be a time when memory allocation would fail and the loop would break, but my computer hung as it was an infinite loop.</p>

<p>I waited for about an hour and finally I had to force shut down my computer.</p>

<p>Some questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does malloc allocate memory from HD also?</li>
<li>What was the reason for above behaviour?</li>
<li>Why didn't loop break at any point of time?</li>
<li>Why wasn't there any allocation failure?</li>
</ul>

<p>Wrong: most computers/OSs support <em>virtual</em> memory, backed by disk space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some questions: does <code>malloc</code> allocate memory from HDD also?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>malloc</code> asks the OS, which in turn may well use some disk space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What was the reason for above behavior? Why didn't the loop break at any time?</p>
  
  <p>Why wasn't there any allocation failure?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You just asked for too little at a time: the loop would have broken eventually (well after your machine slowed to a crawl due to the large excess of virtual vs physical memory and the consequent super-frequent disk access, an issue known as ""thrashing"") but it exhausted your patience well before then.  Try getting e.g. a megabyte at a time instead.</p>

<p>When a program exceeds consumption of memory to a certain level, the computer stops working because other applications do not get enough memory that they require.</p>

<p>A total stop is unlikely, but when an operation that normally would take a few microseconds ends up taking (e.g.) tens of milliseconds, those four orders of magnitude may certainly make it <em>feel</em> as if the computer had basically stopped, and what would normally take a minute could take a week.</p>

"How to convert enum names to string in c","61080","","<p>Is there a possibility to convert enumerator names to string in C?</p>
","<p>One way, making the preprocessor do the work. It also ensures your enums and strings are in sync.</p>

<pre><code>#define FOREACH_FRUIT(FRUIT) \
        FRUIT(apple)   \
        FRUIT(orange)  \
        FRUIT(grape)   \
        FRUIT(banana)  \

#define GENERATE_ENUM(ENUM) ENUM,
#define GENERATE_STRING(STRING) #STRING,

enum FRUIT_ENUM {
    FOREACH_FRUIT(GENERATE_ENUM)
};

static const char *FRUIT_STRING[] = {
    FOREACH_FRUIT(GENERATE_STRING)
};
</code></pre>

<p>After the preprocessor gets done, you'll have:</p>

<pre><code>enum FRUIT_ENUM {
    apple, orange, grape, banana,
};

static const char *FRUIT_STRING[] = {
    ""apple"", ""orange"", ""grape"", ""banana"",
};
</code></pre>

<p>Then you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""enum apple as a string: %s\n"",FRUIT_STRING[apple]);
</code></pre>

<p>If the use case is literally just printing the enum name, add the following macros:</p>

<pre><code>#define str(x) #x
#define xstr(x) str(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Then do:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""enum apple as a string: %s\n"", xstr(apple));
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, it may seem like the two-level macro is superfluous, however, due to how stringification works in C, it is necessary in some cases. For example, let's say we want to use a #define with an enum:</p>

<pre><code>#define foo apple

int main() {
    printf(""%s\n"", str(foo));
    printf(""%s\n"", xstr(foo));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output would be:</p>

<pre><code>foo
apple
</code></pre>

<p>This is because str will stringify the input foo rather than expand it to be apple. By using xstr the macro expansion is done first, then that result is stringified. </p>

","<p>The right way to do it is to replace the file descriptors <code>STDIN_FILENO</code>, <code>STDOUT_FILENO</code> and <code>STDERR_FILENO</code> with the opened files using <code>dup2()</code>.  You should also then close the original files in the child process:</p>

"C/C++: Static function in header file, what does it mean?","61034","","<p>I know what it means when static function is declared in source file. I am reading some code, found that static function in header files could be invoke in other files. </p>
","<p>Is the function defined in the header file? So that the actual code is given directly in the function, like this:</p>

<pre><code>static int addTwo(int x)
{
  return x + 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then that's just a way of providing a useful function to many different C files. Each C file that includes the header will get its own definition that it can call. This of course wastes memory, and is (in my opinion) a quite ugly thing to be doing, since having executable code in a header is generally not a good idea.</p>

<p>Remember that <code>#include</code>:ing a header basically just pastes the contents of the header (and any other headers included by it) into the C file as seen by the compiler. The compiler never knows that the one particular function definition came from a header file.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: In many cases, it's actually a good idea to do something like the above, and I realize my answer sounds very black-and-white about this which is kind of oversimplifying things a bit. For instance, code that models (or just uses) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">intrinsic functions</a> can be expressed like the above, and with an explicit <code>inline</code> keyword even:</p>

<pre><code>static inline int addTwo(int *x)
{
  __add_two_superquickly(x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the <code>__add_two_superquickly()</code> function is a fictional intrinsic, and since we want the entire function to basically compile down to a single instruction, we really want it to be inlined. Still, the above is cleaner than using a macro.</p>

<p>The advantage over just using the intrinsic directly is of course that wrapping it in another layer of abstraction makes it possible to build the code on compilers lacking that particular intrinsic, by providing an alternate implementation and picking the right one depending on which compiler is being used.</p>
